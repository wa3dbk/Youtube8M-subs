I think about coaching and online

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
I think about coaching and online
coaching<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.109> experience<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:25.920> coach

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
but this is the first time I went heavy

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.200 
but this is the first time I went heavy
on<00:00:28.710> squats<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> long<00:00:29.460> time<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> really

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
on squats in a long time so I really

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.070 
on squats in a long time so I really
want<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> talk<00:00:30.480> about<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.900> weights

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
want to talk about the weights

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.400 
want to talk about the weights
themselves<00:00:31.710> instead<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.700> different<00:00:33.000> topic

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
themselves instead of a different topic

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.690 
themselves instead of a different topic
so<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.070> guys<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.399> I'm<00:00:35.579> doing

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so here as you guys can see I'm doing

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
so here as you guys can see I'm doing
some<00:00:35.910> bandage<00:00:36.300> squats<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.829> band's<00:00:38.040> for

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
some bandage squats and the band's for

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.709 
some bandage squats and the band's for
some<00:00:38.520> reason<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:38.910> tied<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> same<00:00:39.690> way

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
some reason they tied them the same way

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
some reason they tied them the same way
I<00:00:39.870> usually<00:00:40.110> tie<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.219> they<00:00:41.340> were<00:00:41.579> very

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I usually tie them but they were very

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.970 
I usually tie them but they were very
very<00:00:42.450> tight<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> bottom<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> lift<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
very tight at the bottom of the lift and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
very tight at the bottom of the lift and
you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.370> them<00:00:44.489> losing<00:00:44.670> all<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> tension

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you can see them losing all the tension

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.160 
you can see them losing all the tension
at<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> bottom<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> lift<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.050> there

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
at the bottom of the lift and there

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.250 
at the bottom of the lift and there
wobbling<00:00:46.379> around<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> stuff<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.200> know

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
wobbling around and stuff so you know

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.630 
wobbling around and stuff so you know
what<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> should<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.739> done<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.219> should<00:00:50.550> have

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
what I should have done is I should have

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
what I should have done is I should have
wrapped<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.210> band's<00:00:51.390> again<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
wrapped the band's again around the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.740 
wrapped the band's again around the
squat<00:00:52.680> rack<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.010> twice<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.420> by<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
squat rack you know twice but by the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
squat rack you know twice but by the
time<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.989> notice<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.710> loose

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
time I notice that there is so loose

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
time I notice that there is so loose
there's<00:00:56.610> already<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> weight<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
there's already a lot of weight on the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.779 
there's already a lot of weight on the
bar<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.289> too<00:00:58.469> lazy<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.489> strip

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
bar and I was too lazy to you know strip

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
bar and I was too lazy to you know strip
all<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> way<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> check<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> bands<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
all the way down and check the bands and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
all the way down and check the bands and
wrap<00:01:01.800> them<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.160> again<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.850> i<00:01:03.059> left<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> band's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
wrap them up again so i left the band's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
wrap them up again so i left the band's
how<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.260> were<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> instead<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> did<00:01:05.580> was

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
how they were and instead what I did was

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.840 
how they were and instead what I did was
I<00:01:06.030> added<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:07.200> weight<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:08.040> plates<00:01:08.340> to

the<00:01:08.880> bar<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.170> lack<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the bar to make up for the lack of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.880 
the bar to make up for the lack of
resistance<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.610> bands<00:01:11.790> were<00:01:11.909> adding<00:01:12.890> so

school and he's had some setbacks you

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.100 
school and he's had some setbacks you
know<00:02:12.850> his<00:02:12.970> injuries<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.750> playing<00:02:13.960> football

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
know his injuries and playing football

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.450 
know his injuries and playing football
and<00:02:14.350> stuff<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.100> he's<00:02:15.250> doing<00:02:15.430> a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
and stuff like that so he's doing a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.220 
and stuff like that so he's doing a
really<00:02:15.670> good<00:02:15.940> job<00:02:16.000> man<00:02:16.480> he's<00:02:16.600> strong<00:02:17.050> as<00:02:17.200> hell

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
really good job man he's strong as hell

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.260 
really good job man he's strong as hell
considering<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.820> know<00:02:18.940> his<00:02:19.120> life

considering that you know his life

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.520 
considering that you know his life
doesn't<00:02:19.510> revolve<00:02:19.660> around<00:02:19.810> powerlifting<00:02:20.380> like

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
doesn't revolve around powerlifting like

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.970 
doesn't revolve around powerlifting like
ours<00:02:20.830> does<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.220> mine<00:02:21.490> does<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:21.820> least<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.800> now

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
ours does or mine does at least so now

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920 
ours does or mine does at least so now
here's<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:24.580> 95<00:02:25.150> pounds<00:02:25.570> we'll<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.810> call<00:02:25.900> it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
here's for 95 pounds we'll just call it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.650 
here's for 95 pounds we'll just call it
500<00:02:26.410> pounds<00:02:26.710> plus<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.730> band<00:02:27.970> tension<00:02:28.420> so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
500 pounds plus the band tension so

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.570 
500 pounds plus the band tension so
let's<00:02:29.320> just<00:02:29.530> say<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.160> very<00:02:30.190> top<00:02:30.460> of<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
let's just say at the very top of the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.730 
let's just say at the very top of the
lift<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:31.080> 520<00:02:32.080> pounds<00:02:32.200> or<00:02:32.470> something

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
lift it's like 520 pounds or something

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.550 
lift it's like 520 pounds or something
like<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:32.890> I'm<00:02:33.160> not<00:02:33.340> even<00:02:33.550> sure<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:35.110> did

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
like that I'm not even sure and I did

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.040 
like that I'm not even sure and I did
this<00:02:35.710> wait<00:02:35.980> for<00:02:36.430> three<00:02:37.150> sets<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.540> two<00:02:37.780> reps

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
this wait for three sets of two reps

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.840 
this wait for three sets of two reps
each<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:39.100> course<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.520> more<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
each and of course I have more in the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.280 
each and of course I have more in the
tank<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.330> that's<00:02:40.480> what<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.690> program<00:02:40.870> called

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
tank but that's what the program called

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.370 
tank but that's what the program called
for<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.709> day<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:43.480> first<00:02:43.900> rep<00:02:44.230> right

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
for this day and that first rep right

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.840 
for this day and that first rep right
there<00:02:44.620> that's<00:02:44.800> part<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> highest<00:02:45.430> rep<00:02:45.640> out

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
there that's part of the highest rep out

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.980 
there that's part of the highest rep out
of<00:02:45.970> all<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.390> sets<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.810> reps<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:49.450> after<00:02:49.690> that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
of all the sets and reps but after that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.110 
of all the sets and reps but after that
I<00:02:50.230> did<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> pretty<00:02:51.250> good<00:02:51.610> job<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.820> hit<00:02:52.030> in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I did a pretty good job a hit in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.360 
I did a pretty good job a hit in
parallel<00:02:52.510> or<00:02:52.660> trying<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.740> dip<00:02:53.920> below<00:02:53.950> parallel

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
parallel or trying to dip below parallel

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.010 
parallel or trying to dip below parallel
you<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.090> see<00:02:55.240> it's<00:02:55.360> still<00:02:55.510> kind<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.750> awkward

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
you can see it's still kind of awkward

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.890 
you can see it's still kind of awkward
for<00:02:56.170> me<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.320> hit<00:02:56.590> depth<00:02:57.630> sometimes<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:58.840> hit

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
for me to hit depth sometimes I can hit

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.030 
for me to hit depth sometimes I can hit
sometimes<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.320> can't<00:02:59.530> kind<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.770> hit<00:02:59.890> or<00:02:59.920> miss

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
sometimes I can't kind of hit or miss

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.430 
sometimes I can't kind of hit or miss
sometimes<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.630> first<00:03:01.840> set<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.170> usually

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
sometimes but that first set is usually

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.290 
sometimes but that first set is usually
just<00:03:02.500> kind<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.220> know<00:03:03.280> testing<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.060> weight

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
just kind of you know testing the weight

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.150 
just kind of you know testing the weight
still<00:03:04.570> getting<00:03:04.810> used<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.290> still<00:03:05.500> building

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
still getting used to it still building

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.970 
still getting used to it still building
some<00:03:06.310> confidence<00:03:07.350> now<00:03:08.350> here<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> am<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.920> kind

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
some confidence now here I am just kind

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.710 
some confidence now here I am just kind
of<00:03:09.070> like<00:03:09.220> wasting<00:03:10.090> time<00:03:10.239> not<00:03:10.420> even<00:03:10.450> know<00:03:10.630> what

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
of like wasting time not even know what

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.590 
of like wasting time not even know what
I'm<00:03:10.780> doing<00:03:11.610> all<00:03:12.610> right<00:03:12.670> I'm<00:03:13.000> finally<00:03:13.390> under

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
I'm doing all right I'm finally under

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.180 
I'm doing all right I'm finally under
the<00:03:13.690> bar<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.530> set<00:03:14.769> was<00:03:14.920> probably

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
the bar and this set was probably

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.860 
the bar and this set was probably
probably<00:03:15.400> my<00:03:15.580> best<00:03:15.790> set<00:03:16.090> for<00:03:16.420> depth<00:03:16.630> wise

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
probably my best set for depth wise

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.050 
probably my best set for depth wise
speed<00:03:17.860> wise<00:03:18.070> i<00:03:18.220> was<00:03:18.310> pretty<00:03:18.489> good<00:03:18.640> too<00:03:18.700> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
speed wise i was pretty good too you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.720 
speed wise i was pretty good too you
know<00:03:19.840> again<00:03:20.230> I'm<00:03:20.709> not<00:03:20.769> going<00:03:21.010> all<00:03:21.370> out<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.550> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
know again I'm not going all out on the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.800 
know again I'm not going all out on the
sets<00:03:22.000> I'm<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.330> doing<00:03:22.480> what<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.630> program

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
sets I'm just doing what the program

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.780 
sets I'm just doing what the program
says<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.709> i<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.920> probably<00:03:24.070> get<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.340> wait<00:03:24.519> for

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
says so i can probably get this wait for

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.910 
says so i can probably get this wait for
good<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.900> by<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.080> looks<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.650> feels<00:03:26.739> i

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
good and by the looks of it it feels i

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.800 
good and by the looks of it it feels i
can<00:03:27.040> get<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:27.459> six<00:03:28.300> reps<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.660> all

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
can get it for like six reps in all

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.570 
can get it for like six reps in all
honesty<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:32.709> me<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:32.920> know<00:03:32.950> believe<00:03:33.550> it

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
honesty and for me you know believe it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.979 
honesty and for me you know believe it
or<00:03:33.670> not<00:03:33.760> mean<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.000> hardest<00:03:34.269> part<00:03:34.390> for<00:03:34.480> me<00:03:34.600> is

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
or not mean the hardest part for me is

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.870 
or not mean the hardest part for me is
getting<00:03:35.170> down<00:03:35.470> into<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> squat<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.760> know

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
getting down into the squat you know

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.300 
getting down into the squat you know
once<00:03:37.150> i<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.709> know<00:03:38.800> try<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.070> dip<00:03:39.280> below

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
once i like you know try to dip below

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.130 
once i like you know try to dip below
parallel<00:03:39.700> after<00:03:40.390> after<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> weight<00:03:41.110> is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
squat and I for me personally I can't

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.830 
squat and I for me personally I can't
squat<00:04:36.130> like<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.460> because<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.300> can't<00:04:37.600> stay<00:04:37.750> as

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
squat like this because I can't stay as

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.450 
squat like this because I can't stay as
tight<00:04:38.110> but<00:04:38.889> for<00:04:39.040> something<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.310> good

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
tight but for something like good

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.980 
tight but for something like good
mornings<00:04:39.790> where<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.389> weight<00:04:40.540> isn't<00:04:40.690> heavy

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
mornings where the weight isn't heavy

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.840 
mornings where the weight isn't heavy
then<00:04:41.500> that's<00:04:41.889> no<00:04:42.010> problem<00:04:42.250> I'll<00:04:42.550> hold<00:04:42.730> the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
then that's no problem I'll hold the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.940 
then that's no problem I'll hold the
weight<00:04:42.970> like<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.240> any<00:04:43.389> day<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:44.710> can<00:04:44.830> see

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
weight like that any day and you can see

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.990 
weight like that any day and you can see
I<00:04:44.980> took<00:04:45.070> off<00:04:45.250> my<00:04:45.280> wrist<00:04:45.490> wraps<00:04:45.700> right<00:04:45.850> here

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
I took off my wrist wraps right here

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.820 
I took off my wrist wraps right here
because<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.930> didn't<00:04:47.139> hurt<00:04:47.229> my<00:04:47.350> wrist<00:04:47.530> at<00:04:47.710> all

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
because it didn't hurt my wrist at all

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.469 
because it didn't hurt my wrist at all
like<00:04:47.979> it<00:04:48.100> does<00:04:48.220> with<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.490> squat<00:04:48.760> so<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.300> just

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
like it does with the squat so I just

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.760 
like it does with the squat so I just
figured<00:04:49.630> why<00:04:49.930> even<00:04:50.050> wear<00:04:50.350> them<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.500> these<00:04:53.620> are

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
figured why even wear them so these are

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.830 
figured why even wear them so these are
just<00:04:53.830> light<00:04:54.190> arched<00:04:54.820> back<00:04:55.090> good<00:04:55.300> mornings<00:04:55.630> I'm

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
just light arched back good mornings I'm

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.620 
just light arched back good mornings I'm

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
focusing on pushing my butt out pausing

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.090 
focusing on pushing my butt out pausing
at<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.810> bottom<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.229> lift<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.620> little<00:04:59.919> bit

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
and just really developing that arch

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.350 
and just really developing that arch
throughout<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.479> whole<00:05:04.630> entire<00:05:04.660> lift<00:05:06.360> this
