00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
through there and it looks like it's

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.890 
through there and it looks like it's
another<00:05:03.280> pterodactyl<00:05:04.280> if<00:05:04.730> that's<00:05:05.420> what<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:05.780> is

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
another pterodactyl if that's what it is

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.920 
another pterodactyl if that's what it is
flying<00:05:06.850> dinosaur<00:05:09.610> here<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.730> is

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.640 

get<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.080> out<00:05:15.200> of<00:05:15.230> it

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
get it out of it

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.160 
get it out of it
OOP

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:30.950 

there<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.260> is<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:24.090> same<00:05:24.360> as<00:05:24.570> this<00:05:24.810> one<00:05:29.960> so

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
there it is just the same as this one so

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.390 
there it is just the same as this one so
that<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.740> end<00:05:31.980> of<00:05:32.250> my<00:05:32.580> video<00:05:33.120> guys<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:37.400> I
