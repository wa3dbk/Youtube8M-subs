00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
of whatever they are the clue lose it

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.170

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
shows them doing different actions so

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.670 
shows them doing different actions so
you<00:03:37.240> got<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.690> keep<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.110> your<00:03:38.140> memory<00:03:38.470> mind
