little<00:02:51.430> victory<00:02:51.880> rolls<00:02:52.209> or<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.079> could<00:02:53.230> just

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
little victory rolls or you could just

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.280 
little victory rolls or you could just
leave<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.650> hanging<00:02:53.769> down<00:02:54.130> like<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.610> I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
leave it hanging down like this I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.569 
leave it hanging down like this I
however<00:02:56.290> I'm<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.890> continue<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.590> make

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
however I'm going to continue to make

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.289 
however I'm going to continue to make
knots<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.989> see<00:03:02.170> where<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.560> goes<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.299> I've

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
knots and see where that goes and I've

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.360 
knots and see where that goes and I've
never<00:03:04.510> done<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.900> hairstyle<00:03:05.170> before<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.130> I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
never done this hairstyle before so I

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.220 
never done this hairstyle before so I
don't<00:03:06.849> know<00:03:07.180> how<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.569> going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> turn<00:03:08.049> out

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
don't know how it's going to turn out

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.910 
don't know how it's going to turn out
but<00:03:09.180> um<00:03:10.709> we'll<00:03:11.709> see

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
but um we'll see

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.160 
but um we'll see
I<00:03:12.130> pretty<00:03:12.489> much<00:03:12.579> knotted<00:03:13.239> all<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.569> my<00:03:13.690> lens<00:03:13.930> but

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
I pretty much knotted all of my lens but

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.690 
I pretty much knotted all of my lens but
I've<00:03:14.290> got<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.620> weird<00:03:14.920> little<00:03:15.100> rat<00:03:15.370> tail

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.699 
I've got this weird little rat tail
so<00:03:16.829> obviously<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.040> doesn't<00:03:18.250> look<00:03:18.549> cute<00:03:19.709> so

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.580 

kind<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.230> what<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.440> looks<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:52.989> yeah<00:03:53.989> just<00:03:54.410> a

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
kind of what it looks like yeah just a

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.090 
kind of what it looks like yeah just a
series<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.220> knots<00:03:56.530> definitely<00:03:57.530> know<00:03:57.680> when<00:03:58.069> I

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
series of knots definitely know when I

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.510 
series of knots definitely know when I
was<00:03:58.280> doing<00:03:58.970> this<00:03:59.650> if<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.920> had<00:04:01.069> curled<00:04:01.340> my<00:04:01.489> hair

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
was doing this if I had curled my hair

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.240 
was doing this if I had curled my hair
before<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.720> would<00:04:02.870> have<00:04:02.930> been<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.410> whole

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
before and this would have been a whole

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.570 
before and this would have been a whole
lot<00:04:04.280> easier<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.680> kind<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.400> liked<00:04:07.550> the

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
lot easier but I kind of liked the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.030 
lot easier but I kind of liked the
pattern<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.390> creates<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.140> even<00:04:09.830> if<00:04:09.920> you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
pattern that it creates and even if you

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.860 
pattern that it creates and even if you
stopped<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:10.640> mid<00:04:10.880> here<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:11.600> let<00:04:11.720> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
stopped like mid here and just let the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.420 
stopped like mid here and just let the
rest<00:04:12.050> of<00:04:12.170> your<00:04:12.290> hair<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.620> know<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:12.980> think<00:04:13.280> that

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
rest of your hair I know I think that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.910 
rest of your hair I know I think that
could<00:04:13.580> be<00:04:13.610> really<00:04:13.730> pretty<00:04:14.120> too

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
could be really pretty too

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.340 
could be really pretty too
but<00:04:15.920> uh<00:04:15.950> yeah<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.880> hope<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.419> guys<00:04:17.570> enjoyed<00:04:18.200> the
