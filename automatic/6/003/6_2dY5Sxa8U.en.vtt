00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
nation performance as I started maybe we

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.449 
nation performance as I started maybe we
can<00:02:16.420> record<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:17.019> twice<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:17.680> fast<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.280> we

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
can record this twice as fast so that we

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.490 
can record this twice as fast so that we
could<00:02:18.579> slow<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:18.970> all<00:02:19.359> down<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.989> pitch<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.350> down

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
could slow it all down and pitch it down

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.140 
could slow it all down and pitch it down
