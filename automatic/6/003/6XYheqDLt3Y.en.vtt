00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.330
 very good goals here we are in the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.369
 episode number 9 of super racing 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.660
 gta 5 you know we're going to put six 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.430
 races that all three in the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.840
 description for the clueless and 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.270
 also to thank all those who 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.890
 support me are you in the previous video in 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.570
 episode number 8 both on my channel 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 as an asset so let's start 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.830
 with this career the number one race 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.440
 dirty overtaking as you see is by 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.870
 the car this with the sant 15 xl that are 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.760
 some jumps so complicated that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.650
 how much do you get it, it bursts 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.210
 towards the end you end badly we go with the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.769
 next with the number two severity 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.050
 but this you asked me a lot in the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.400
 The last one is that climbing is a very 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.989
 good the truth the best that has 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.030
 played and as you see here we have to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.190
 take this bridge sideways like that 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.960
 we have to go without gravity it's called that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.909
 but come on it's awesome how do you catch it 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.769
 the cool ones with many friends you can 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.659
 put with contacts in contact as 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.430
 you prefer, I put it with 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.080
 contact because the funniest part and 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.990
 that's how we ended up in that epic way 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.760
 with the third rocks men mother of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.320
 today to names that I put is that no 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.780
 I have no name as you see here 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.520
 begins very much in peak because the people 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.829
 scatter out there goes by all the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.000
 sites and it's an impressive descent 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.100
 It is total mortal 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 because it is that they are natural cases that 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.670
 they make stones trees that you see 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.260
 here I bring you this tree 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 directly I got stuck I came to 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.530
 little heart then that trunk 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.960
 impressive as you see, we advance with 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.100
 the slipstream and there is one of hits as you see 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.440
 here there are natural things but also 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.050
 artificial like that they are blocks and 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.369
 Drums and other things are very good 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.440
 this race to do it with your 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.330
 Friends is perfect but you are careful 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.820
 in the goal because I and the first and 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.190
 I ended up alone it's a stitch we go with the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.350
 next with the number four ramp 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.790
 incredible what is this because it is one of the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.250
 larger ramps that I've seen myself in 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.950
 GTA 5 does an English creator 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.390
 it seems and it is already a barbarity as it is 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.820
 here we have to take it carefully 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.649
 There are several directions as you see here at 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.810
 end of the fifth the part that I took it 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.910
 there were people who did not even know how to catch ball 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.220
 it's very complicated I do not say the race 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.800
 continue with jumps and other things that 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.330
 It's pretty good I recommend 100% 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.970
 we go with the next one with the five 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.739
 Big jumps in gta 5 online what 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.470
 first we have to dodge this tower 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.720
 of electricity that put in there with the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.190
 car from the out and then this jump from 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.270
 be bigger too we have to 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.030
 move to the bridge 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.150
 and to arrive I know it comes very difficult already 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.680
 I say after several attempts with 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.750
 these jumps that you're going crazy 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.220
 truth is that they are impressive more than 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.870
 nothing because you start flying by 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.080
 all the map and do not you think that a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.850
 so small car fly so much and with 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.370
 the final jump this jump the style that 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.050
 we have to cross the whole sea and have 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.630
 clear the goal that almost exploded is not 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.300
 know why we liked you go with 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.710
 the last one with the number 6 look at nothing 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.630
 what is this because it is a very 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.100
 difficult that we have to go with the car 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 you know you know it if all these 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.520
 super cars we have the suspension very 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.410
 low very complicated because it is not 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.570
 is very well very well placed in 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.340
 through this one take off a blow from the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.320
 host and what we want to do is jump 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.390
 of the car just before falling into the water 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 because if we do not die and when we jump 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.090
 we have to go swimming by swimming 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.130
 that now I'm going to put it on camera 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.640
 fast is very good it's like a triathlon 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.020
 but everything is here no less until up 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 the up to the next point that what 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.150
 we have to take with you one thing a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 my friend try I did not know what there was 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.230
 what to do and here will be the triangle 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.970
 boy what he did was 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.780
 run to the finish line with this 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.190
 player was hilarious truth will 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.720
