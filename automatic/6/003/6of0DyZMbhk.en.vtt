00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:19.023
We will focus on Danger Zone, which is for Samsung Galaxy smartphones for free.

00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:30.023

Let's look on standard levels from the beginning.

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:52.023
I want to recommend, this game was Developed with Nasa cooperation, that's why there is a link, where you can find information about the Space. 

00:02:53.724 --> 00:03:21.023
Standard level looks like this. After you see instructions, you can try gravitation on your own.

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:29.023
You can see this was one and only shot win, which gives me some bonus points.

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:40.023
Three stars - so it is a great points award.

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:48.023
