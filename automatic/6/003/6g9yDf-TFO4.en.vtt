00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
as you can see this car handles every

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.160 
as you can see this car handles every
corner<00:00:53.789> superbly<00:00:54.789> the<00:00:55.300> speed<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.809> good<00:00:56.019> as

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
corner superbly the speed is good as

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.220 
corner superbly the speed is good as
well<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:57.579> very<00:00:57.760> many<00:00:57.850> cars<00:00:58.180> can<00:00:58.420> hold<00:00:58.839> speed

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
well not very many cars can hold speed

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.079 
well not very many cars can hold speed
through<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.530> corners<00:00:59.949> which<00:01:00.730> means<00:01:00.940> you'd

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
through the corners which means you'd

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.790 
through the corners which means you'd
have<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.360> slow<00:01:01.510> down<00:01:01.659> more<00:01:01.899> but<00:01:02.230> this<00:01:02.409> car<00:01:02.649> you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
have to slow down more but this car you

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.740 
have to slow down more but this car you
can<00:01:02.920> keep<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.190> moderate<00:01:03.609> pace<00:01:03.640> whoo<00:01:04.089> we're<00:01:04.659> on

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
can keep a moderate pace whoo we're on

fishtail that much and when you send

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.920 
fishtail that much and when you send
your<00:01:12.640> tires<00:01:12.909> that<00:01:13.360> wouldn't<00:01:13.690> matter<00:01:13.780> anyway

through<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.539> corners<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.319> flies<00:01:30.100> fast<00:01:30.490> them

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
through the corners it flies fast them

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.930 
through the corners it flies fast them
for<00:01:31.300> no<00:01:31.479> problems<00:01:31.929> at<00:01:32.050> all<00:01:32.140> even<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.220> radius<00:01:33.700> 1

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
for no problems at all even the radius 1

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.690 
for no problems at all even the radius 1
corners<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.780> can<00:01:34.810> put<00:01:35.350> some<00:01:35.500> speed<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.950> but

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
corners you can put some speed in but

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.880 
corners you can put some speed in but
what<00:01:36.819> happens<00:01:37.119> when<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.330> go<00:01:37.450> too<00:01:37.509> fast<00:01:37.899> well

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
what happens when you go too fast well

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.669 
what happens when you go too fast well
you<00:01:39.490> lose<00:01:39.670> any<00:01:40.060> car<00:01:40.960> will<00:01:41.080> crash<00:01:41.289> when<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.560> go

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
you lose any car will crash when you go

you lose any car will crash when you go
too<00:01:41.740> fast<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:43.690> car<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.200> have<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.409> just

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
too fast so this car you have to just

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.859 
too fast so this car you have to just
ease<00:01:44.979> off<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.250> tiny<00:01:45.490> bit<00:01:45.700> even<00:01:46.149> any<00:01:46.299> coming<00:01:46.750> out

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
ease off a tiny bit even any coming out

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.380 
ease off a tiny bit even any coming out
of<00:01:47.020> corn<00:01:47.340> dough<00:01:48.340> put<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.610> power<00:01:48.789> 12<00:01:49.060> early

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
of corn dough put the power 12 early

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.669 
of corn dough put the power 12 early
going<00:01:49.630> through<00:01:49.810> corners<00:01:50.110> because<00:01:50.319> you<00:01:50.500> will

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
going through corners because you will

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.429 
going through corners because you will
crash<00:01:54.090> let's<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.240> how<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.509> car<00:01:55.750> handles<00:01:56.079> the

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
crash let's see how this car handles the

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.980 
crash let's see how this car handles the
chicane<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.090> can<00:01:58.180> see<00:01:58.299> this<00:01:58.539> is<00:01:58.719> a<00:01:58.750> very

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
chicane as you can see this is a very

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.130 
chicane as you can see this is a very
tight<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.619> Renee<00:02:00.430> degree<00:02:00.850> heaven<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.899> next

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
tight and Renee degree heaven to a next

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.870 
tight and Renee degree heaven to a next
hundred<00:02:02.560> eighty<00:02:02.770> degree<00:02:03.070> helping<00:02:03.490> me<00:02:03.670> with

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
hundred eighty degree helping me with

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.260 
hundred eighty degree helping me with
the<00:02:03.969> radius<00:02:04.329> 1<00:02:04.509> corners<00:02:04.990> now<00:02:05.920> many<00:02:06.700> cars<00:02:06.969> would

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
the radius 1 corners now many cars would

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.880 
the radius 1 corners now many cars would
have<00:02:07.479> difficulty<00:02:07.869> doing<00:02:08.049> this<00:02:08.410> at<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.769> high

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
have difficulty doing this at a high

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.979 
have difficulty doing this at a high
speed<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:10.090> if<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.269> watched<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.600> pearl<00:02:10.780> show

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
speed but if you watched a pearl show

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.190 
speed but if you watched a pearl show
goes<00:02:11.440> round<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:12.340> flies<00:02:12.730> one<00:02:12.970> without<00:02:13.299> any<00:02:13.600> fish

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
goes round it flies one without any fish

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.800 
goes round it flies one without any fish
10<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:15.609> means<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.000> cars<00:02:16.209> got<00:02:16.359> fairly

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
10 so this means the cars got fairly

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.740 
10 so this means the cars got fairly
stable<00:02:17.049> written<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:19.600> could

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
stable written and then it one you could

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.539 
stable written and then it one you could
push<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.170> bit<00:02:20.200> further<00:02:20.560> than<00:02:20.890> most<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.459> a

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
push it a bit further than most of a

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.349 
push it a bit further than most of a
cause<00:02:22.140> that's<00:02:23.140> what<00:02:23.320> makes<00:02:23.500> LMP<00:02:23.859> cars

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
cause that's what makes LMP cars

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.599 
cause that's what makes LMP cars
slightly<00:02:25.359> superior<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.230> GT<00:02:26.620> cars<00:02:26.859> because

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
slightly superior to the GT cars because

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.840 
slightly superior to the GT cars because
they<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> better<00:02:29.100> rear<00:02:30.100> end<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.670> they'll

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
they have a better rear end then they'll

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:43.540 
they have a better rear end then they'll
be<00:02:30.970> able<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.269> give<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:31.989> corners<00:02:32.320> faster

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.360 

so<00:02:44.150> all<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.690> great<00:02:45.080> cup<00:02:45.440> definitely

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so all in all a great cup definitely

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.280 
so all in all a great cup definitely
worth<00:02:46.520> getting<00:02:46.580> because<00:02:47.330> not<00:02:47.900> only<00:02:47.930> would<00:02:48.170> it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
worth getting because not only would it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.050 
worth getting because not only would it
look<00:02:48.410> good<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.680> your<00:02:48.770> shelf<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.730> will<00:02:49.850> race

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
look good on your shelf but it will race

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.140 
look good on your shelf but it will race
fantastically<00:02:50.780> as<00:02:50.930> well<00:02:51.700> you'll<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.730> able<00:02:52.970> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
fantastically as well you'll be able to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.170 
fantastically as well you'll be able to
easily<00:02:53.330> come<00:02:54.100> could<00:02:55.100> easily<00:02:55.490> compete<00:02:55.940> with

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
easily come could easily compete with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.080 
easily come could easily compete with
the<00:02:56.450> Audi<00:02:56.630> Porsche<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:58.160> other<00:02:58.460> purchase<00:02:58.850> and
