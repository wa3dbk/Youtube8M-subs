magazine I believe it's shown in Cyrus
something<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.750> thing<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.170> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
something like that the thing with this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
something like that the thing with this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's going to be taking place in the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's going to be taking place in the
same<00:01:24.210> universe<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.689> attack<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.409> Titan<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
same universe as attack on Titan in the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
different set of characters obviously

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.929 
different set of characters obviously
from<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> sounds<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> sounds<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
from the sounds but it sounds like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
from the sounds but it sounds like
they're<00:01:30.150> trying<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> milk<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> they're<00:01:30.990> trying

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they're trying to milk it they're trying

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
they're trying to milk it they're trying
to<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> different<00:01:32.939> magazine

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to you know make a different magazine

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.600 
to you know make a different magazine
because<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.869> magazine<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.710> attack<00:01:35.460> on

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
because the magazine that attack on

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.890 
because the magazine that attack on
Titan<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
Titan is and is not going to be in the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390 
Titan is and is not going to be in the
same<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.560> new<00:01:37.770> story<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
same one that this new story is going to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.950 
same one that this new story is going to
be<00:01:38.490> taking<00:01:38.610> place<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.540> even<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
be taking place I don't even know if the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
be taking place I don't even know if the
same<00:01:40.140> writer<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.400> doing<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
same writer is going to be doing the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
same writer is going to be doing the
story<00:01:41.970> I'd<00:01:42.090> imagine<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> know

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
story I'd imagine not because you know

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.749 
story I'd imagine not because you know
he<00:01:43.740> already<00:01:43.860> has<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> chance<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.640> would

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
he already has a chance what would

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.760 
he already has a chance what would
attack<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.180> titan<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.259> stuff<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> they

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
attack on titan all the stuff that they

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800 
attack on titan all the stuff that they
you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.100> request<00:01:47.670> from<00:01:47.790> him<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.600> i

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you know request from him to do so i

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
you know request from him to do so i
don't<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.380> he's<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.740> doing<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
don't think he's going to be doing the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
don't think he's going to be doing the
story<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.460> little<00:01:50.790> skeptical<00:01:51.180> about<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.479> right

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
story so little skeptical about it right

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
story so little skeptical about it right
now<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:51.990> depending<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.399> do

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
now it's like depending on what they do

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
now it's like depending on what they do
and<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.000> approach<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> could<00:01:55.259> either

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and how they approach it it could either

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
and how they approach it it could either
be<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.430> addition<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> story

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
be a really good addition to the story

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
be a really good addition to the story
or<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.590> big<00:01:58.710> flop

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
or it could just be a really big flop

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.069 
or it could just be a really big flop
because<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.329> something<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.020> know

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
because if it's something like you know

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.600 
because if it's something like you know
that<00:02:01.320> they're<00:02:01.439> trying<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.829> incorporate<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that they're trying to incorporate and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.010 
that they're trying to incorporate and
they<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.090> start<00:02:03.329> making<00:02:03.600> plat<00:02:03.810> holes

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
they just really start making plat holes

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
they just really start making plat holes
that<00:02:04.200> could<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.439> very<00:02:04.770> detrimental<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
that could be very detrimental to the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.850 
that could be very detrimental to the
story<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.719> definitely<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.649> them<00:02:07.829> trying

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
story because definitely is them trying

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380 
story because definitely is them trying
to<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.250> milk<00:02:08.819> whatever<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.239> can

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
to you know milk whatever they can

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.809 
to you know milk whatever they can
attack<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.899> Titan<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> super<00:02:11.069> sleeper<00:02:11.640> hit

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
attack on Titan is a super sleeper hit

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.460 
attack on Titan is a super sleeper hit
you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.030> came<00:02:12.209> out<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> 2009<00:02:13.050> but

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you know came out of 2009 but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.140 
you know came out of 2009 but
once<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.890> anime<00:02:14.190> came<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.760> absolutely

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
once the anime came out it is absolutely

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.960 
once the anime came out it is absolutely
exploded<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:15.960> them<00:02:16.890> doing<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.610> I'm

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
exploded and them doing this is like I'm

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.700 
exploded and them doing this is like I'm
skeptical<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.960> want<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
skeptical is like I want it to be a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.560 
skeptical is like I want it to be a
great<00:02:20.010> addition<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.730> as<00:02:20.850> well<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.330> just

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
great addition to it as well and just

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.720 
great addition to it as well and just
overall<00:02:21.690> something<00:02:22.170> enjoyable<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.830> if<00:02:23.070> they

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
overall something enjoyable but if they

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.340 
overall something enjoyable but if they
don't<00:02:24.090> even<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.540> original<00:02:25.200> writer

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
don't even have the original writer

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.840 
don't even have the original writer
again<00:02:25.620> i'm<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:25.950> sure<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.490> they're<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.790> to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
again i'm not sure what they're going to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.280 
again i'm not sure what they're going to
be<00:02:26.970> doing<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.300> far<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.570> who's<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.200> be

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
be doing as far as who's going to be

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.780 
be doing as far as who's going to be
writing<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:28.890> drawing<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.520> whatnot

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
writing it and drawing it and whatnot

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.180 
writing it and drawing it and whatnot
but<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:31.470> something<00:02:32.070> to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
but it's really right now something to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.500 
but it's really right now something to
be<00:02:32.310> skeptical<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:33.000> because<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.450> just

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
be skeptical about because it's just

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.090 
be skeptical about because it's just
like<00:02:33.750> obviously<00:02:34.440> they're<00:02:34.620> doing<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
like obviously they're doing this to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.430 
like obviously they're doing this to
make<00:02:35.220> more<00:02:35.400> money<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.270> what<00:02:37.080> will

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
make more money but it's like what will

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.780 
make more money but it's like what will
it<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.650> good<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.250> overall<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> big

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it be good as just overall the big

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.520 
it be good as just overall the big
question<00:02:39.150> will<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.450> be<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> good<00:02:39.810> addition<00:02:39.990> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
question will it be a good addition to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.140 
question will it be a good addition to
the<00:02:40.650> attack<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.100> titan<00:02:41.430> universes<00:02:41.970> what

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the attack on titan universes what

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
the attack on titan universes what
remains<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.570> be<00:02:42.660> seen<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.050> hopefully<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.160> is

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
remains to be seen but hopefully this is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.980 
remains to be seen but hopefully this is
something<00:02:44.370> good<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.450> overall<00:02:45.600> more

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
something good and just overall more
