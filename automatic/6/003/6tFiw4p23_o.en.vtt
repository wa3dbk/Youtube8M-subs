00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.460

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 2 good 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.469
 and a potato and a potato or two potatoes 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.609
 it depends on how many people are 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.609
 make the stew 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.190
 we put the oil 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.670
 a splash of oil 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.659
 we put the onion 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700
 ah 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.510
 We leave a few minutes and sauté a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.410
 little bit and then we put 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.410
 the shoulder 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.990
 if the fire of this fort 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.430
 t 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.980
 we're going circling that go 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.980
 renewing a bit everything 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.170
 walk a little bit of pepper 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.680
 and a little sweet red red paprika 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.680
 like two teaspoons of coffee 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.690
 previously they have been saved from the lamb 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.690
 sign if you can put 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.540
 the pepper can also be put some 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.790
 hours before with the high 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 we leave fed a little 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.830
 ah 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:37.940
 the laurel forests are put 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.780
 Always teeth 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.940
 the skin from outside if you just keep 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.240
 This dish is typical of some time 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.240
 year 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.530
 for winter 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.040
 and it was associated with something traditionally 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.550
 that is to say for example there are dishes and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.300
 they are typical of the killing season 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.530
 no this is more can not say the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.680
 winter 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.110
 and by the time they were there they got together 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.940
 well the majority 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.580
 It would be a party dish rather than a 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.700
 eat every day 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.700
 then I would say then equal their lands 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.810
 and for how long of about ten 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.810
 minutes about ten minutes frying 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.980
 this is more than anything for the lamb 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.030
 take the taste of the entire floor 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.100
 and so that it goes mixing everything 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.760
 if we put the little glass of wine 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.760
 stale wine 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.610
 if you can put a few drops too 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.990
 of vinegar 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.990
 that also to taste 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.729
 now he lets himself go watching this work at 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.199
 minimum 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:20.250
 the lid is cooked for one hour 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:23.710
 this we leave it we leave it we leave it 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.720
 about three quarters of an hour and then you 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.120
 we add the portability potato to 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.040
 squares and leave a quarter of an hour 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.510
 more or twenty more minutes very well from 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.729
 fire how does this have to be at a minimum 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.490
 to the minimum with the air cooking that over 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.710
 three quarters of an hour and then the potato and 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.710
 you just know everything all together 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.020
 Well, this is already prepared 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.979

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.979

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.370
 ah 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.810

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:17.699

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:20.569
