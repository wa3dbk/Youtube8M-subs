00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.240
 very good girls very good guys are 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.700
 twelve thirty thirty 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.369
 our news and that if you leave your 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.919
 the favorite ax is very much appreciated 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:14.019
 Excuse me for the look I have 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.639
 every time I feel worse but I wanted to 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.010
 make this news I wanted to do the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.800
 effort to record this news because 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.480
 I wanted to give him I wanted to ask you to 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.180
 you who tell me what they are 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.660
 your two favorites also because the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.970
 aids magazine publishes the 10 best 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.579
 video games of the modern era 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.129
 the top 10 and I would like to know 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.319
 what are those games for you 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.840
 what are the games for you 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:44.150
 you have removed something inside not really 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.180
 The truth is that I decided what are the 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.970
 less games something quite difficult not 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.540
 but I think that always in each of 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.880
 we have one or have several 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.220
 that have been marked for example 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.480
 silent hill and 'resident evil' final 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.200
 fantasy 7 those are to say 3 that I 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.850
 they have marked me and possibly marked me 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.119
 one in special 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 in the area and it was nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.330
 total challenge the movie game of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.330
 the characters the truth is that that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.490
 frame I do not know why maybe it's because a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.460
 game has been extremely difficult 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.100
 and yes and if he marked me and see if he's years old 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
 no but in this list for example 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.930
 we are talking about the modern era of 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.740
 the current games well we could 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.250
 say bayonet call of duty 4 by 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.130
 big example missed 4 without a doubt 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.500
 It was a game that marked me 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.670
 a before and after what it meant 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.189
 not the name of our channel there 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.250
 pose him dejected was a clan realized 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.490
 expressly for that not for people 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.789
 is big missed 4 but hey this is the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.810
 list of the magazine age and attention 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.479
 number 10 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.290
 call of duty 4 modern warfare 19 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.580
 littlebigplanet number 8 bayonet number 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.739

 number 2 super mario galaxy and number 1 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.920
 dark souls maybe surprise this list 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.390
 many games are missing for example to me 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.380
 beyond to schulz is a game that also 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.810
 for example in the previous generation I 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.340
 charm 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.769
 you know it 's a kind of game 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.120
 more a cinematic style but 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.430
 It really was a great game 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.739
 dogs too but it does not reach those 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.319
 limits not but good there come in topics 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.760
 of fun too but certainly 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.959
 had to choose at the time in the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.910
 that came out then it could perfectly be 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:14.060
 well or bayonet or gta 4 of what's coming 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.190
 being the last of us without any doubt 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.690
 I do not know I do not know there are a lot of games like that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.660
 I want to know our opinion at 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.760
 respect and apologize for the face to 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.560
 the face that I have and all because I'm 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.690
 quite emaciated perhaps is the last 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.599
 news that I do so I hope that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.280
 then you support nectars the news and 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.840
