00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
white vinegar and I have turned the heat

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.060 
white vinegar and I have turned the heat
on<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:25.100> low<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.960> we<00:00:27.260> are<00:00:27.289> gonna<00:00:27.500> be<00:00:27.650> using<00:00:27.830> this

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
on to low and we are gonna be using this

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.660 
on to low and we are gonna be using this
as<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.430> dye<00:00:28.609> bath<00:00:28.910> for<00:00:29.359> our<00:00:29.480> yarn<00:00:29.830> um<00:00:30.830> but

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
as the dye bath for our yarn um but

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.029 
as the dye bath for our yarn um but
first<00:00:31.849> we're<00:00:32.359> soaking<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.379> yarn<00:00:33.620> whether

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
first we're soaking the yarn whether

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.469 
first we're soaking the yarn whether
that's<00:00:34.249> pretty<00:00:34.609> soaking<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:34.969> yarn<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.239> water

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:35.479 
that's pretty soaking the yarn in water

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.919 
that's pretty soaking the yarn in water
where<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:37.609> yarns<00:00:37.879> determined<00:00:38.389> to<00:00:38.449> flow<00:00:38.719> but

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929 
where the yarns determined to flow but

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.250 
where the yarns determined to flow but
we're<00:00:39.079> trying<00:00:39.229> to<00:00:39.379> get<00:00:39.530> it<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:39.769> sink<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.260> to

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
we're trying to get it to sink and to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.770 
we're trying to get it to sink and to
pre-soak<00:00:43.039> in<00:00:43.339> the<00:00:43.579> dye<00:00:43.729> bath<00:00:43.879> itself<00:00:44.359> because

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
pre-soak in the dye bath itself because

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.309 
pre-soak in the dye bath itself because
when<00:00:44.899> we<00:00:45.049> actually<00:00:45.260> add<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.729> food<00:00:46.969> coloring

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:47.319 
when we actually add the food coloring

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.219 
when we actually add the food coloring
we<00:00:48.319> want<00:00:48.679> to<00:00:49.129> have<00:00:49.489> as<00:00:49.940> little<00:00:49.999> movement<00:00:50.719> in

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
we want to have as little movement in

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.270 
we want to have as little movement in
the<00:00:51.799> water<00:00:52.010> as<00:00:52.339> possible<00:00:53.229> so<00:00:54.229> that<00:00:54.379> way<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:54.889> do

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
the water as possible so that way we do

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.119 
the water as possible so that way we do
not<00:00:55.489> get<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:56.119> perfect<00:00:56.659> uniform<00:00:57.079> color<00:00:57.319> but

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
not get a perfect uniform color but

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.969 
not get a perfect uniform color but
instead<00:00:58.429> we<00:00:58.699> get<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:59.089> kettle<00:00:59.629> dyed<00:00:59.979> effect

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
instead we get a kettle dyed effect

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.979 
instead we get a kettle dyed effect
where<00:01:01.219> we<00:01:01.309> get<00:01:01.459> some<00:01:01.699> beautiful<00:01:01.999> variation<00:01:02.749> in

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
where we get some beautiful variation in

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.170 
where we get some beautiful variation in
the<00:01:03.289> shades<00:01:03.619> of<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.159> color<00:01:04.759> that<00:01:04.850> we're

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
the shades of the color that we're

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.060 
the shades of the color that we're
dealing<00:01:05.329> with<00:01:05.799> okay

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
dealing with okay

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.889 
dealing with okay
so<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.520> mean<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.850> want<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.210> have<00:01:08.479> your<00:01:08.630> yarn

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
so I mean you want to have your yarn

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.740 
so I mean you want to have your yarn
completely<00:01:09.500> submerged<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.210> water

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
completely submerged in the water

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.389 
completely submerged in the water
it<00:01:11.930> takes<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.259> tiny<00:01:12.500> bit<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.859> effort<00:01:13.189> just

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
it takes a tiny bit of effort just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.099 
it takes a tiny bit of effort just
because<00:01:13.930> there's<00:01:14.930> air<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.219> yarn<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.960> so

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
because there's air in the yarn and so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.539 
because there's air in the yarn and so
the<00:01:18.200> components<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:18.829> you<00:01:18.920> need<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.250> tell<00:01:19.399> me

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
the components that you need to tell me

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.169 
the components that you need to tell me
on<00:01:20.380> yarn<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.740> 100%<00:01:22.219> wool<00:01:22.520> fingering<00:01:23.030> weight

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
on yarn is 100% wool fingering weight

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.139 
on yarn is 100% wool fingering weight
yarn<00:01:23.320> heat<00:01:24.320> which<00:01:25.189> we<00:01:25.460> are<00:01:25.579> getting<00:01:25.880> from<00:01:26.000> our

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
yarn heat which we are getting from our

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.510 
yarn heat which we are getting from our
stove<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:27.380> need<00:01:27.500> acid<00:01:27.979> from<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.250> form<00:01:28.460> of

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
stove you need acid from the form of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.429 
stove you need acid from the form of
vinegar<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.719> you<00:01:29.840> need<00:01:29.960> your<00:01:30.079> colored

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
vinegar then you need your colored

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.739 
vinegar then you need your colored
source<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.189> we're<00:01:32.149> gonna<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.450> using<00:01:32.600> some

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
source and we're gonna be using some

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.889 
source and we're gonna be using some
liquid<00:01:33.409> food<00:01:33.920> coloring<00:01:34.299> today<00:01:35.299> when<00:01:35.630> we<00:01:35.749> die

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
liquid food coloring today when we die

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.749 
liquid food coloring today when we die
this<00:01:36.140> yarn<00:01:37.749> okay<00:01:38.749> so<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:39.020> am<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:39.679> to<00:01:39.890> let<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
this yarn okay so I am going to let the

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.889 
this yarn okay so I am going to let the
stove<00:01:41.060> come<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.990> just<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.350> brief<00:01:42.920> simmer<00:01:43.899> and

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
stove come to just a brief simmer and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.289 
stove come to just a brief simmer and
then<00:01:44.990> make<00:01:45.229> sure<00:01:45.259> that<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.799> yarn<00:01:46.039> is

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
then make sure that the yarn is

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.599 
then make sure that the yarn is
completely<00:01:47.299> submerged<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.319> then<00:01:49.039> we'll<00:01:49.399> be

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
completely submerged and then we'll be

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.550 
completely submerged and then we'll be
back<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:50.600> add<00:01:50.990> our<00:01:51.679> guy<00:01:52.840> okay<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.899> can<00:01:54.289> see

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
back to add our guy okay you can see

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.080 
back to add our guy okay you can see
that<00:01:54.799> VR<00:01:55.280> or

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
that VR or

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.539 
that VR or
the<00:01:56.240> dynamap<00:01:56.689> is<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.049> boil<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.310> I'm<00:01:58.399> going

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
the dynamap is now to boil so I'm going

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.459 
the dynamap is now to boil so I'm going
to<00:01:58.609> turn<00:01:58.700> off<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.000> stove<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.600> let<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.109> bubble

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
to turn off the stove and let the bubble

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.219 
to turn off the stove and let the bubble
subside<00:02:00.950> because<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:01.969> want<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.270> heat<00:02:02.539> but<00:02:03.109> we

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
subside because we want the heat but we

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.020 
subside because we want the heat but we
don't<00:02:03.500> want<00:02:05.859> have<00:02:06.859> a<00:02:06.890> lot<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.159> movement<00:02:07.549> in<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
don't want have a lot of movement in the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.380 
don't want have a lot of movement in the
water

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
water

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.320 
water
I'm<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.679> moving<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.220> skein<00:02:10.489> back<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.759> bit<00:02:11.120> so

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
I'm just moving the skein back a bit so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.539 
I'm just moving the skein back a bit so
that<00:02:11.360> way<00:02:11.569> we<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.900> try<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.860> want<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.370> get<00:02:13.519> a

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
that way we can try we want to get a

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.690 
that way we can try we want to get a
somewhat<00:02:14.239> even<00:02:14.660> pattern<00:02:15.200> over<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.129> repeats

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
somewhat even pattern over the repeats

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.080 
somewhat even pattern over the repeats
but<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.769> that's<00:02:19.069> not<00:02:19.220> absolutely

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
but you know that's not absolutely

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.960 
but you know that's not absolutely
obsessed<00:02:20.420> essential<00:02:21.080> by<00:02:21.680> any<00:02:21.860> means<00:02:22.099> so<00:02:22.879> now

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
obsessed essential by any means so now

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.550 
obsessed essential by any means so now
I've<00:02:23.090> got<00:02:23.239> my<00:02:23.269> blue<00:02:23.690> food<00:02:24.140> coloring

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I've got my blue food coloring

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.820 
I've got my blue food coloring
eyedropper<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:26.720> am<00:02:27.080> going<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.590> start

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
eyedropper and I am going to start

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.100 
eyedropper and I am going to start
dropping<00:02:28.099> blue<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.880> random<00:02:29.480> places<00:02:29.750> around

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
dropping blue and random places around

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:41.920 
dropping blue and random places around
the<00:02:30.410> dye<00:02:30.590> bath<00:02:31.660> 1<00:02:32.769> 2<00:02:33.769> 3<00:02:34.870> 4<00:02:35.870> 5<00:02:36.380> 6<00:02:37.250> 7<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.720> can

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the dye bath 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you can

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.110 
the dye bath 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you can
see<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:43.280> know<00:02:43.400> there<00:02:43.610> are<00:02:43.640> these<00:02:43.790> dots

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
see that you know there are these dots

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.780 
see that you know there are these dots
and<00:02:44.390> spots<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:45.110> then<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.650> dye<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.099> starting

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and spots but then the dye is starting

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.270 
and spots but then the dye is starting
to<00:02:47.000> kind<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.390> come<00:02:48.290> out<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.799> we'll<00:02:49.010> go<00:02:49.160> around

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
to kind of come out and we'll go around

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.940 
to kind of come out and we'll go around
a<00:02:49.640> bit<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:53.019> well<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.560> after

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
a bit and I think well I like after

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.650 
a bit and I think well I like after
adding<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> initial<00:02:55.790> die<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:55.970> like<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.480> wait<00:02:56.629> a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
adding the initial die I like to wait a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.380 
adding the initial die I like to wait a
bit<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.959> see<00:02:57.170> how<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.709> spreads<00:02:58.190> then<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.360> a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
bit and see how it spreads then get a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.809 
bit and see how it spreads then get a
sense<00:02:59.690> if<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.989> want<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.319> add<00:03:00.470> more<00:03:00.819> because

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
sense if I want to add more because

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.150 
sense if I want to add more because
since<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.450> want<00:03:02.720> there<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:02.989> be<00:03:03.139> a<00:03:03.230> nice<00:03:03.560> mold

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
since we want there to be a nice mold

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.520 
since we want there to be a nice mold
color<00:03:04.489> we<00:03:05.269> don't<00:03:05.510> want<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.720> add<00:03:05.810> too<00:03:06.139> much<00:03:06.290> dye

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
color we don't want to add too much dye

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.840 
color we don't want to add too much dye
because<00:03:06.829> we<00:03:06.920> don't<00:03:07.100> want<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.310> yarn<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.609> become

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
because we don't want the yarn to become

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.490 
because we don't want the yarn to become
saturated<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:10.130> one<00:03:10.310> thing<00:03:10.579> that<00:03:10.609> can<00:03:11.000> be<00:03:11.180> done

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
saturated but one thing that can be done

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.990 
saturated but one thing that can be done
later<00:03:12.500> on<00:03:12.799> is<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:13.220> there's<00:03:13.400> too<00:03:13.609> much<00:03:13.639> white

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
later on is if there's too much white

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.789 
later on is if there's too much white
space<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.569> you<00:03:14.660> would<00:03:14.780> rather<00:03:14.900> there<00:03:15.380> be<00:03:15.560> a

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
space and you would rather there be a

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.920 
space and you would rather there be a
little<00:03:16.040> less<00:03:16.160> white<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.420> then<00:03:17.599> we<00:03:17.780> could

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
little less white is that then we could

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.039 
little less white is that then we could
actually<00:03:18.819> uniformly<00:03:19.819> add<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.329> tiny<00:03:20.660> bit<00:03:20.810> of

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
actually uniformly add a tiny bit of

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.920 
actually uniformly add a tiny bit of
blue<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.620> then<00:03:22.160> make<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.359> light<00:03:23.540> colors

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
blue to then make all the light colors

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.870 
blue to then make all the light colors
of<00:03:24.139> blue<00:03:24.349> be<00:03:25.660> not<00:03:26.660> quite<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.049> bright<00:03:27.440> or<00:03:27.919> even

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
of blue be not quite so bright or even

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.629 
of blue be not quite so bright or even
over<00:03:29.209> dye<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.450> yarn<00:03:29.599> with<00:03:29.930> another<00:03:30.200> color<00:03:30.639> but

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
over dye the yarn with another color but

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.400 
over dye the yarn with another color but
I<00:03:31.940> think<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.450> we're<00:03:32.750> gonna<00:03:32.840> get<00:03:33.109> some<00:03:33.440> nice

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
I think that we're gonna get some nice

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.220 
I think that we're gonna get some nice
modelling<00:03:36.410> because<00:03:36.739> we<00:03:37.280> see<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.760> there<00:03:38.060> is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
modelling because we see that there is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.890 
modelling because we see that there is
some<00:03:39.230> dye<00:03:39.410> that's<00:03:39.680> leeching<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.639> out<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.540> we

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
some dye that's leeching it out and we

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.990 
some dye that's leeching it out and we
want<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.169> let<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:42.440> cool<00:03:42.859> for<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.489> long<00:03:43.669> time

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
want to let this cool for a long time

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.379 
want to let this cool for a long time
because<00:03:44.419> we're<00:03:44.750> not<00:03:44.870> adding<00:03:45.200> any<00:03:45.739> heat<00:03:46.519> as<00:03:46.790> we

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
because we're not adding any heat as we

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.900 
because we're not adding any heat as we
continue<00:03:47.930> here<00:03:49.060> all<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.690> heat<00:03:51.049> has

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
continue here all of the heat has

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.580 
continue here all of the heat has
already<00:03:52.910> been<00:03:53.030> supplied<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.169> longer

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
already been supplied and so the longer

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.559 
already been supplied and so the longer
that<00:03:54.769> we<00:03:55.430> let<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.700> yarn<00:03:55.880> sit<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.269> here<00:03:56.450> with

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
that we let the yarn sit in here with

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.240 
that we let the yarn sit in here with
the<00:03:56.630> heat<00:03:56.870> some<00:03:57.230> more<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> dye<00:03:57.859> will

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the heat some more of the dye will

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.970 
the heat some more of the dye will
absorb<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.609> yarn<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.780> will<00:04:00.169> be<00:04:00.290> back<00:04:00.500> when

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
absorb the yarn so I will be back when

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.330 
absorb the yarn so I will be back when
the<00:04:01.819> color<00:04:02.690> look<00:04:03.079> in<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.260> sender<00:04:03.560> has<00:04:03.590> cleared

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
the color look in the sender has cleared

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.730 
the color look in the sender has cleared
and<00:04:04.579> all<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.909> dye<00:04:05.030> has<00:04:05.209> absorbed

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
and all the dye has absorbed

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.490 
and all the dye has absorbed
yeah<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.670> we're<00:04:07.390> not<00:04:07.510> quite<00:04:07.750> ready<00:04:07.990> to<00:04:08.080> stop

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
yeah so we're not quite ready to stop

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.980 
yeah so we're not quite ready to stop
letting<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.370> die<00:04:09.580> but<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.300> just<00:04:10.330> kind<00:04:10.960> of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
letting this die but I just kind of

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.080 
letting this die but I just kind of
wanted<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.260> point<00:04:11.470> out<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.610> blue<00:04:12.850> has

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
wanted to point out that the blue has

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.210 
wanted to point out that the blue has
gone<00:04:13.300> all<00:04:13.510> over<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.200> there<00:04:14.530> won't<00:04:14.890> be<00:04:14.950> some

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
gone all over so there won't be some

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.890 
gone all over so there won't be some
pale<00:04:15.430> blue<00:04:15.670> spots<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.270> there<00:04:16.420> will<00:04:16.510> be<00:04:16.570> very

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
pale blue spots but there will be very

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.740 
pale blue spots but there will be very
few<00:04:17.020> white<00:04:17.710> spots<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.610> are<00:04:19.180> left<00:04:19.390> so<00:04:19.630> this

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
few white spots that are left so this

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.700 
few white spots that are left so this
makes<00:04:19.990> me<00:04:20.170> happy

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:20.710 
makes me happy

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.710 
makes me happy
um<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.610> partially<00:04:22.000> because<00:04:22.120> blue

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
um this is partially because blue

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.060 
um this is partially because blue
absorbs<00:04:23.470> slower<00:04:23.830> than<00:04:24.400> say<00:04:24.790> pink<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.480> red<00:04:26.070> and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
absorbs slower than say pink and red and

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.670 
absorbs slower than say pink and red and
so<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:28.630> reason<00:04:28.810> why<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:29.260> wait

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
so this is the reason why you wait

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.340 
so this is the reason why you wait
before<00:04:30.130> adding<00:04:30.700> more<00:04:30.880> color<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.540> see<00:04:31.840> how<00:04:31.990> far

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
before adding more color to see how far

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.550 
before adding more color to see how far
the<00:04:32.680> color<00:04:32.860> will<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.280> diffuse<00:04:33.960> okay<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.380> the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
the color will just diffuse okay so the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.730 
the color will just diffuse okay so the
water<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.010> now<00:04:36.190> cold<00:04:36.640> so<00:04:37.180> there's<00:04:37.960> no<00:04:38.170> chance

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
water is now cold so there's no chance

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.000 
water is now cold so there's no chance
of<00:04:39.070> any<00:04:39.370> more<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.730> that<00:04:39.760> color<00:04:40.120> absorbing<00:04:41.010> but

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
of any more of that color absorbing but

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.760 
of any more of that color absorbing but
if<00:04:42.460> we<00:04:43.120> wanted<00:04:43.540> more<00:04:43.810> blue<00:04:44.080> color<00:04:44.350> we<00:04:44.590> could

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
if we wanted more blue color we could

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.380 
if we wanted more blue color we could
turn<00:04:44.920> up<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.190> heat<00:04:45.460> since<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.000> color<00:04:46.180> and

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
turn up the heat since the color and

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.720 
turn up the heat since the color and
there<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.630> no<00:04:46.780> uniform<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:48.100> cook<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.520> some

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
there is no uniform and cook it some

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.590 
there is no uniform and cook it some
more<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.270> instead<00:04:51.000> we're<00:04:52.000> going<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.180> go<00:04:52.330> and

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
more and instead we're going to go and

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.120 
more and instead we're going to go and
start<00:04:52.900> washing<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:53.620> yarn

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
start washing the yarn

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.070 
start washing the yarn
there's<00:04:54.730> no<00:04:54.850> I've<00:04:54.970> got<00:04:55.210> here<00:04:55.540> about<00:04:55.600> of

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
there's no I've got here about of

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.740 
there's no I've got here about of
lukewarm<00:04:56.530> water<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.940> I'm<00:04:58.060> gonna<00:04:58.180> put<00:04:58.420> in<00:04:58.510> just

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
lukewarm water and I'm gonna put in just

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.650 
lukewarm water and I'm gonna put in just
a<00:04:58.840> little<00:04:59.050> bit<00:04:59.140> of<00:04:59.230> dish<00:04:59.380> soap<00:04:59.790> to<00:05:00.790> rinse<00:05:01.450> the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
a little bit of dish soap to rinse the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.220 
a little bit of dish soap to rinse the
yarn<00:05:01.960> until<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:03.130> color<00:05:03.640> starts<00:05:04.090> training<00:05:04.480> um

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
yarn until the color starts training um

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.510 
yarn until the color starts training um
until<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.920> rinse<00:05:06.130> water<00:05:06.340> runs<00:05:06.820> clear

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
until the rinse water runs clear

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.860 
until the rinse water runs clear
but<00:05:09.520> what<00:05:09.970> I'm<00:05:10.060> going<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.240> show<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.510> is<00:05:10.840> that

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
but what I'm going to show you is that

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.370 
but what I'm going to show you is that
we<00:05:11.290> have<00:05:11.320> this<00:05:11.920> beautiful<00:05:12.340> skein<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.000> yarn

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
we have this beautiful skein of yarn

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.190 
we have this beautiful skein of yarn
that<00:05:14.380> has<00:05:14.590> this<00:05:14.890> modeled<00:05:15.640> blue<00:05:16.570> color<00:05:16.900> and

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
that has this modeled blue color and

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.020 
that has this modeled blue color and
after<00:05:17.710> I've<00:05:17.800> been<00:05:17.830> rinsing<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.550> guess<00:05:18.880> I'll

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
after I've been rinsing it I guess I'll

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.180 
after I've been rinsing it I guess I'll
come<00:05:19.180> back<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.510> show<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.320> what's<00:05:20.950> more

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
come back and show it to you what's more

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.300 
come back and show it to you what's more
so<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:21.520> can<00:05:21.550> see<00:05:22.590> more<00:05:23.590> clearly<00:05:23.890> what<00:05:24.070> the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
so you can see more clearly what the

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.240 
so you can see more clearly what the
coloration<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:24.970> like<00:05:25.410> okay<00:05:26.410> and<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:26.920> here's

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
coloration is like okay and so here's

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.160 
coloration is like okay and so here's
our<00:05:27.460> modelled<00:05:27.850> blue<00:05:28.090> yarn<00:05:28.480> where<00:05:28.840> we<00:05:28.960> have

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
our modelled blue yarn where we have

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.010 
our modelled blue yarn where we have
regions<00:05:30.160> of<00:05:30.280> dark<00:05:30.610> color<00:05:31.180> in<00:05:31.390> two<00:05:31.570> regions<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
regions of dark color in two regions the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.620 
regions of dark color in two regions the
white<00:05:32.200> color<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:33.100> it's<00:05:33.610> very<00:05:33.910> subtle<00:05:34.240> but

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
white color and it's very subtle but

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.410 
white color and it's very subtle but
unlike<00:05:35.140> the<00:05:35.410> other<00:05:35.590> so<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.910> yarn<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.210> we<00:05:37.300> get

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
unlike the other so the yarn that we get

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.760 
unlike the other so the yarn that we get
in<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.570> other<00:05:37.660> tutorials<00:05:38.260> where<00:05:38.470> it's<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.650> more

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
in the other tutorials where it's a more

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.610 
in the other tutorials where it's a more
uniform<00:05:39.190> color<00:05:39.520> this<00:05:40.450> is<00:05:40.630> a<00:05:40.660> way<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:41.200> in<00:05:41.350> a

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
uniform color this is a way that in a

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.490 
uniform color this is a way that in a
single<00:05:42.010> batch<00:05:42.220> you<00:05:42.610> can<00:05:42.640> make<00:05:42.970> some<00:05:43.210> nice

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
single batch you can make some nice

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.140 
single batch you can make some nice
kettles<00:05:44.500> diet<00:05:44.770> appearance<00:05:45.370> because<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:45.940> have

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
kettles diet appearance because you have

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.860 
kettles diet appearance because you have
