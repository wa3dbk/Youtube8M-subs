00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
said that our primary focus would be on

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.580 
said that our primary focus would be on
the<00:04:16.330> students<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:16.959> fact<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.470> our

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
the students and in fact it's in our

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.470 
the students and in fact it's in our
mission<00:04:17.709> statement<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:18.459> think<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.299> says

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
mission statement I think it says

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.310 
mission statement I think it says
placing<00:04:19.870> students<00:04:20.290> at<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.500> center<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:21.040> the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
placing students at the center of the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.720 
placing students at the center of the
academic<00:04:22.860> activity<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:25.430> exactly<00:04:26.430> meets

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
academic activity this exactly meets

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.510 
academic activity this exactly meets
that<00:04:26.940> mission<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.590> taking<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.340> degree

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
that mission this is taking a degree

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.580 
that mission this is taking a degree
that<00:04:29.850> we<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.120> has<00:04:30.330> high<00:04:30.510> quality<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.230> taking

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that we know has high quality and taking

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.950 
that we know has high quality and taking
it<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.920> students<00:04:32.490> allowing<00:04:33.420> them<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.750> take

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
it to the students allowing them to take

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.250 
it to the students allowing them to take
it<00:04:34.140> in<00:04:34.310> conditions<00:04:35.310> or<00:04:35.490> modalities<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.600> fits

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
it in conditions or modalities that fits

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.170 
it in conditions or modalities that fits
their<00:04:37.530> needs<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.430> think<00:04:38.550> that's<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.060> most

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
their needs so I think that's the most

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.150 
their needs so I think that's the most
exciting<00:04:39.570> thing<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.080> we're<00:04:40.740> fulfilling

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
exciting thing is that we're fulfilling

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.740 
exciting thing is that we're fulfilling
our<00:04:41.580> mission<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:42.000> reaching<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.390> students

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
our mission of reaching the students

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.050 
our mission of reaching the students
which<00:04:42.930> we've<00:04:43.140> been<00:04:43.260> doing<00:04:43.560> for<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.160> last<00:04:44.370> 12

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
which we've been doing for the last 12

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.840 
which we've been doing for the last 12
years<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:46.110> new<00:04:46.290> way<00:04:46.470> we've<00:04:47.100> organized<00:04:47.700> the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
years in a new way we've organized the

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.840 
years in a new way we've organized the
program<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.530> two<00:04:49.530> courses<00:04:49.890> at<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> time<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.730> an

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
program in two courses at a time on an

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.000 
program in two courses at a time on an
eight-week<00:04:51.240> format<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.590> courses

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
essentially can be taken in any order up

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.980 
essentially can be taken in any order up
to<00:04:55.830> what<00:04:56.010> we<00:04:56.130> call<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.430> capstone<00:04:56.910> course<00:04:56.990> so

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
to what we call the capstone course so

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.350 
to what we call the capstone course so
the<00:04:58.260> first<00:04:58.560> year<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.640> a<00:04:59.670> half<00:04:59.820> of<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.150> program

you get to the capstone course of course
you<00:05:04.500> have<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.710> take<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.070> at<00:05:05.610> a<00:05:05.790> specific<00:05:06.000> time

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510
