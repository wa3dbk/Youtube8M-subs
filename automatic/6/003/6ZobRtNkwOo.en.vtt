helmet I feel that the light itself on
its<00:02:37.510> own<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:38.019> not<00:02:38.500> powerful<00:02:39.459> enough<00:02:39.730> or<00:02:40.180> throws

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
its own is not powerful enough or throws

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
you've got that on there you can remove

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.749 
you've got that on there you can remove
the<00:04:37.469> light<00:04:37.680> from<00:04:37.860> your<00:04:37.949> helmet<00:04:38.430> should<00:04:38.580> you

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
the light from your helmet should you

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:46.279 
the light from your helmet should you
need<00:04:38.939> to<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.990> then<00:04:40.289> flip<00:04:41.069> it<00:04:41.189> back<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:45.289> just

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
need to and then flip it back on just

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.140 
need to and then flip it back on just
like<00:04:46.409> that

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
like that

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.580 
like that
this<00:04:48.150> also<00:04:48.419> thing<00:04:48.569> gives<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.050> option<00:04:49.409> of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
this also thing gives you the option of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.480 
this also thing gives you the option of
moving<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.699> light<00:04:50.909> up<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.139> down<00:04:52.439> to<00:04:53.099> suit<00:04:53.340> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
moving the light up and down to suit the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.700 
moving the light up and down to suit the
position<00:04:53.939> on<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.150> helmet<00:04:54.539> and<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:55.530> where

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
position on the helmet and to where

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.629 
position on the helmet and to where
you're<00:04:55.889> looking<00:04:58.280> simply<00:04:59.280> connect<00:04:59.580> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
you're looking simply connect the

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.790 
you're looking simply connect the
battery<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.330> light<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:03.259> then<00:05:04.259> you'll

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
battery to the light and then you'll

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.040 
battery to the light and then you'll
give<00:05:05.009> you<00:05:05.930> high<00:05:06.930> mode<00:05:07.819> which<00:05:08.819> is<00:05:09.000> 800<00:05:09.840> lumen

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
give you high mode which is 800 lumen

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.269 
give you high mode which is 800 lumen
then<00:05:13.050> give<00:05:13.229> you<00:05:13.379> 50%<00:05:14.599> and<00:05:15.599> it<00:05:16.529> gives<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.949> a

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:17.279 
then give you 50% and it gives you a

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.769 
then give you 50% and it gives you a
slow<00:05:17.879> blink<00:05:18.770> for<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.860> strobe<00:05:20.159> mode<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.779> then

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
slow blink for the strobe mode and then

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.330 
slow blink for the strobe mode and then
to<00:05:21.960> off<00:05:23.629> what<00:05:24.629> I<00:05:24.659> find<00:05:25.020> if<00:05:25.139> mine<00:05:25.379> is<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:26.009> find

to off what I find if mine is I find

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.170 
to off what I find if mine is I find

cycling off-road especially in woods is

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.129 
cycling off-road especially in woods is

that's<00:06:11.879> why<00:06:12.120> it's<00:06:12.599> extremely<00:06:12.870> helpful<00:06:14.060> that's

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
that's why it's extremely helpful that's

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.360 
that's why it's extremely helpful that's
why<00:06:15.300> I<00:06:15.330> can<00:06:15.779> use<00:06:15.960> it<00:06:16.080> in<00:06:16.199> the<00:06:16.289> medium<00:06:16.650> mode<00:06:16.889> and

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
why I can use it in the medium mode and

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.829 
why I can use it in the medium mode and
find<00:06:17.639> it<00:06:17.759> bright<00:06:17.939> enough<00:06:18.210> because<00:06:18.419> all<00:06:18.509> I<00:06:18.569> need

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:18.839 
find it bright enough because all I need

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.559 
find it bright enough because all I need
to<00:06:18.960> do<00:06:19.139> is<00:06:19.529> angle<00:06:19.979> my<00:06:20.279> head<00:06:20.550> see<00:06:21.210> where<00:06:21.419> I'm

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
to do is angle my head see where I'm

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:21.980 
to do is angle my head see where I'm
going

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
going

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.140 
going
and<00:06:22.110> then<00:06:22.710> my<00:06:22.830> main<00:06:23.069> light<00:06:23.310> will<00:06:23.520> follow<00:06:23.789> and

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
and then my main light will follow and

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.240 
and then my main light will follow and
illuminate<00:06:24.839> the<00:06:24.960> trail<00:06:25.229> for<00:06:25.589> me<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:26.129> one

improvement the possibly could be made

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.439 
improvement the possibly could be made
is<00:06:29.729> because<00:06:30.439> the<00:06:31.439> light<00:06:31.620> is<00:06:31.949> such<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.639> small<00:06:33.060> and

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
is because the light is such a small and

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.399 
is because the light is such a small and
light<00:06:33.689> and<00:06:34.050> nice<00:06:34.409> unit<00:06:35.509> they<00:06:36.509> could<00:06:36.750> make<00:06:37.080> the

light and nice unit they could make the
