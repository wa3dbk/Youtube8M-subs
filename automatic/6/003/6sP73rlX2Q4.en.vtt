00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
is we're going to alright one thing is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.279 
is we're going to alright one thing is
that<00:00:46.309> backwash<00:00:47.309> rinse<00:00:49.190> recirculate<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
that backwash rinse recirculate and

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.260 
that backwash rinse recirculate and
waste<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.399> different

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
waste they are all different

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.209 
waste they are all different
okay<00:00:55.879> recirculate<00:00:57.320> returns<00:00:58.320> back<00:00:58.770> into<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
okay recirculate returns back into the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.420 
okay recirculate returns back into the
pool<00:00:59.449> filter<00:01:00.449> bypass<00:01:01.230> enough<00:01:01.739> illnesses

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pool filter bypass enough illnesses

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.850 
pool filter bypass enough illnesses
that's<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:02.969> recirculate<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that's what recirculate is because it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.399 
that's what recirculate is because it
bypasses<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.909> filter<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.840> goes<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.200> into

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
bypasses the filter and goes back into

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
bypasses the filter and goes back into
the<00:01:07.530> main<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.130> pool<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.729> filter<00:01:09.150> if

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the main in my pool would not filter if

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.109 
the main in my pool would not filter if
it's<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.600> circular<00:01:10.320> net<00:01:10.650> okay<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> Bob

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it's on or circular net okay so that Bob

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.230 
it's on or circular net okay so that Bob
passes<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.810> tank<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.350> yes<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.970> then

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
passes this tank right here yes and then

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
passes this tank right here yes and then
how<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.479> waste<00:01:15.840> well<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.460> does

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
how about waste well that's what it does

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080 
how about waste well that's what it does
it<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.780> bypasses<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.799> filter<00:01:19.830> goes<00:01:20.700> straight

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it it bypasses the filter goes straight

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
it it bypasses the filter goes straight
through<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.659> multi-port<00:01:22.200> head<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.460> your

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
through this multi-port head out to your

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
through this multi-port head out to your
backwash<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:24.750> goes<00:01:25.350> nowhere<00:01:25.799> back<00:01:26.159> into

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
backwash which goes nowhere back into

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.190 
backwash which goes nowhere back into
your<00:01:26.580> pool<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.180> whatever<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.810> sucking

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
your pool so whatever you're sucking

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
your pool so whatever you're sucking
from<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> skimmer<00:01:28.740> goes<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
from the skimmer goes out here in the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.490 
from the skimmer goes out here in the
yard<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.470> my

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
yard so it's not going to go in my

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.780 
yard so it's not going to go in my
filter<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> don't<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> clean<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
filter I don't have to clean it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.359 
filter I don't have to clean it
basically<00:01:33.270> after<00:01:33.780> cleaning<00:01:34.079> okay<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.890> that's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
basically after cleaning okay not that's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:35.810 
basically after cleaning okay not that's
cool

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
cool

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.380 
cool
alright<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.409> why<00:01:37.680> maybe<00:01:38.490> whenever<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
alright so that's why maybe whenever I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.330 
alright so that's why maybe whenever I
vacuum<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> waste<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.280> on

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
vacuum to waste and I have it on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
vacuum to waste and I have it on
backwash<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.329> clogging<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.840> filter<00:01:43.259> still

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
backwash it's clogging my filter still

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
backwash it's clogging my filter still
right<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.579> into<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> sand

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
right because it's going into the sand

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
right because it's going into the sand
so<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.619> whenever<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.430> waste

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so what so whenever you put it on waste

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.569 
so what so whenever you put it on waste
that<00:01:48.000> bypasses<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> filter<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that bypasses the filter that I got you

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.240 
that bypasses the filter that I got you
all<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.180> we're<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> turn<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
all right we're going to turn it to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.719 
all right we're going to turn it to
banks<00:01:53.520> alright<00:01:54.479> once<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> turn<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> waste

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
banks alright once you turn it to waste

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.770 
banks alright once you turn it to waste
you're<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> make<00:01:57.119> sure<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you're going to make sure if you have a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080 
you're going to make sure if you have a
ball<00:01:58.140> valve<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.640> make<00:01:59.820> sure<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ball valve on here you make sure the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.200 
ball valve on here you make sure the
ball<00:02:00.270> valve<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.689> up<00:02:01.070> okay<00:02:02.070> once<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
ball valve is up okay once we have it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.359 
ball valve is up okay once we have it
always<00:02:03.649> I'm<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> turn<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> pump<00:02:05.310> back

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
always I'm going to turn the pump back

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.000 
always I'm going to turn the pump back
on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
on

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.440 
on
why<00:02:07.010> would<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.550> ball<00:02:07.850> valve<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
why would they have a ball valve on the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.350 
why would they have a ball valve on the
waistline<00:02:09.340> that's<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.490> time<00:02:10.729> when<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.240> have

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
waistline that's the time when you have

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.960 
waistline that's the time when you have
a<00:02:11.390> ball<00:02:11.660> valve<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.290> waistline<00:02:12.970> you're

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
a ball valve on the waistline you're

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
a ball valve on the waistline you're

reason<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.270> tell<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
reason of that and I'm going to tell you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.630 
reason of that and I'm going to tell you
why<00:02:21.520> if<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.940> ever<00:02:23.710> turn<00:02:24.710> this<00:02:25.010> multi<00:02:25.430> fork

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
why if you ever turn this multi fork

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
why if you ever turn this multi fork
back<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:27.200> make<00:02:27.440> sure<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:28.160> turn<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.850> pump<00:02:29.150> off

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
back you make sure you turn the pump off

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.500 
back you make sure you turn the pump off
that<00:02:30.650> takes<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.220> pressure<00:02:31.460> off<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.390> this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
that takes the pressure off of this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.170 
that takes the pressure off of this
gasket<00:02:32.780> listen.you<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.250> once<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> take<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
gasket listen.you and once you take that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.840 
gasket listen.you and once you take that
pressure<00:02:35.390> off<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.990> gasket<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.800> can<00:02:37.640> turn

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
pressure off of that gasket you can turn

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.670 
pressure off of that gasket you can turn
this<00:02:38.290> gutter

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
this gutter

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.450 
this gutter
okay<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:41.410> instead<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.470> them<00:02:42.710> replacing<00:02:43.340> that

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
okay so instead of them replacing that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.070 
okay so instead of them replacing that
spoke<00:02:43.820> gasket<00:02:44.330> they<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.660> put<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> ball<00:02:45.050> valve

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
spoke gasket they just put a ball valve

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.050 
spoke gasket they just put a ball valve
ball<00:02:45.740> valve<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.250> that's<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.670> cheap<00:02:46.880> way<00:02:47.030> of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
ball valve on it that's a cheap way of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.090 
ball valve on it that's a cheap way of
doing<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.600> that's<00:02:48.320> not<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.680> proper<00:02:48.950> way

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
doing it that's not the proper way

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.920 
doing it that's not the proper way
that's<00:02:49.580> not<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> proper<00:02:50.240> way<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.510> best<00:02:50.750> way

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
that's not the proper way the best way

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.700 
that's not the proper way the best way
they<00:02:51.080> do<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:53.030> replace<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.470> what

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
they do it is to replace it so what

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.500 
they do it is to replace it so what
would<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.220> just<00:02:55.790> take<00:02:55.970> these<00:02:56.210> screws

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
would you do you just take these screws

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.300 
would you do you just take these screws
right<00:02:56.840> off<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.050> top<00:02:57.260> screws<00:02:57.770> off<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.100> top

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
right off the top screws off the top

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.060 
right off the top screws off the top
right<00:02:58.580> here<00:02:58.940> pull<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.780> head<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.680> head<00:03:00.860> up

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
right here pull the head of the head up

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.070 
right here pull the head of the head up
and<00:03:01.340> that's<00:03:02.030> further<00:03:02.270> as<00:03:02.480> we're<00:03:02.720> going<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.900> go

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
and that's further as we're going to go

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.380 
and that's further as we're going to go

loses<00:04:17.400> water<00:04:17.850> first

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
loses water first

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.780 
loses water first
it's<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.049> pumps<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.530> cavitate<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.580> most

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
it's the pumps on the cavitate and most

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.030 
it's the pumps on the cavitate and most
of<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.000> fat<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:22.080> water's<00:04:22.440> going<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.650> lose<00:04:22.830> up

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
of the fat the water's going to lose up

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.590 
of the fat the water's going to lose up
the<00:04:23.130> skimmer<00:04:23.400> first<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.510> once<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.930> have<00:04:25.170> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
the skimmer first so once you have a

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:42.629 
main speed that does it wake up the dead
algae<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:34.940> can<00:04:37.640> get<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.730> out<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.810> immediately

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.960 

so<00:04:43.639> what<00:04:43.910> what<00:04:44.240> okay<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:44.750> now<00:04:45.050> we<00:04:45.110> just<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:45.970> if

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970

vacuuming<00:05:04.370> them<00:05:04.789> with<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.030> skimmer<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:05.630> we're

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
vacuuming them with the skimmer so we're

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.150 
vacuuming them with the skimmer so we're
going<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.900> turn<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.320> main<00:05:06.500> drain<00:05:06.860> off

going to turn the main drain off
up-and-down<00:05:08.150> position<00:05:08.810> means<00:05:09.050> they're<00:05:09.259> on<00:05:09.410> so

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
up-and-down position means they're on so

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.230 
up-and-down position means they're on so
we're<00:05:09.800> going<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.009> turn<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:10.430> main<00:05:10.610> drain<00:05:10.970> off

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
we're going to turn this main drain off

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.200 
we're going to turn this main drain off
now<00:05:12.139> it<00:05:12.320> gave<00:05:12.530> all<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.250> suction<00:05:13.759> right<00:05:13.940> there

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
now it gave all the suction right there

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.290 
now it gave all the suction right there
and<00:05:14.419> through<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.199> one<00:05:15.470> pi<00:05:15.710> into<00:05:16.400> this<00:05:16.520> T<00:05:16.789> now

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
and through this one pi into this T now

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.040 
and through this one pi into this T now
under<00:05:17.630> there

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
under there

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.840 
under there
so<00:05:18.289> it's<00:05:18.380> given<00:05:18.620> all<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.949> suction<00:05:19.370> right<00:05:19.580> here

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
so it's given all the suction right here

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.659 
so it's given all the suction right here
main<00:05:20.389> drain<00:05:20.690> is<00:05:20.810> turned<00:05:21.080> off<00:05:21.350> so<00:05:22.160> now<00:05:22.370> he<00:05:22.430> can

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
main drain is turned off so now he can

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.120 
main drain is turned off so now he can
vacuum<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.389> pool<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.350> pool<00:05:24.650> press<00:05:25.990> Kevin

vacuum this pool like a pool press Kevin

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.900 
vacuum this pool like a pool press Kevin
is<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.810> all<00:05:29.810> right
