00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.589
 Hello friends 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.149
 I will expose my humble point of view on the manipulation exercised 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:07.800
 by the media 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.570
 since time immemorial the show and the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.630
 mass entertainment to keep the people away from decisions 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.249
 political and social 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.239
 in addition to theater performances and nowadays movies or television are 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.239
 used to manipulate people unconsciously 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.050
 knowing a little the functioning of the mind we will know that it is vital 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.339
 importance the subconscious or the subjective mind when forming opinions 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.340
 ideas his way of thinking 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 when we are watching a movie our brainwave rhythm goes down 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.500
 thus facilitating access to the subconscious mind to record any 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.910
 message 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.180
 the problem is that by accepting the idea that what we are seeing is a lie 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.950
 science fiction or simply by other preconceptions we accept the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 truthfulness of the message as in the case of the news the conscious mind is not 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.740
 bothers to refute what we perceive 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.190
 and in this way they enter directly into the subconscious by easily creating a 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.390
 way of thinking about people 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.290
 On the other hand, sports such as great representation football 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 media have several functions 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.410
 entertain and make us stop thinking about other less tribal things 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 second 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.270
 make people download the Euroleague and the emotions so 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.920
 keep us then docile and meek in front of other things truly 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.770
 important 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.820
 create a false idea of ​​protection that makes man join in ways of 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.160
 think and in this case football teams that fight for common goals 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.940
 associated with the idea that if you think like others you find the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.460
 protection in the group 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.500
 so you need to be a football team or you'll be left alone 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.310
 sure there are many more hidden functions in this great Roman circus but 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 I think with this we already have an idea of ​​the manipulation that is 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.670
 orchestrated from the shadow 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.469
 thank you very much for keeping an open mind and for listening to my message 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.080
 see you soon
