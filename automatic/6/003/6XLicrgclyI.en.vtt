00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
alright and alright so it's kind of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
alright and alright so it's kind of
risky<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.690> using<00:00:48.899> any<00:00:49.289> flying

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
risky but we're not using any flying

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
risky but we're not using any flying
characters<00:00:50.670> today<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.050> care

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
characters today but we don't care

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
characters today but we don't care
because<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:53.250> jet<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:53.789> kind<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
because with jet these kind of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.560 
because with jet these kind of
specialism<00:00:55.399> he's<00:00:56.399> homing<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:56.940> hack<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
specialism he's homing it's hack a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.799 
specialism he's homing it's hack a
billion<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.410> something<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.280> kind<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
billion or something is it's kind of it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
billion or something is it's kind of it
will<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> replace<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.890> flying<00:01:02.190> because

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
will kind of replace the flying because

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 
will kind of replace the flying because
he<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.300> high<00:01:03.600> while<00:01:04.500> using<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
he can go up pretty high while using it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.149 
he can go up pretty high while using it
so<00:01:05.280> anyway<00:01:06.210> today's<00:01:06.630> level<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.979> be

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so anyway today's level is going to be

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
so anyway today's level is going to be
metal<00:01:08.760> Harbor<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.189> I'm<00:01:11.360> actually<00:01:12.360> can't<00:01:12.689> wait

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
