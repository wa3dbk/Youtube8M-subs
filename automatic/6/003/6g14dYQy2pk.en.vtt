00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.520
 In laptop cleaning we change the thermal paste which, during operation, 

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:13.252
 clean the fan impellers with a cotton swab and put special oil on the fan (on some laptop models) 

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:17.316
 we also clean the laptop's motherboard and interior from dust 

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:22.000
 to prevent damage from static electricity or overheating. 

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:26.506
 In the first picture you see that the dust accumulates 

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:33.216
 from the hot air flow to the brush output louvers and slowly blocking them, 

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.916
 resulting in warm air being trapped inside the laptop 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.409
 So the internal temperature increases and the result after a while 

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:46.304
 is the laptop's graphics card or motherboard burn. 

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:58.211
 In the second figure you see a more intense example where the dust in the brush output louvers has created a kind of "sponge" that blocks the outlet of the hot air causing overheating. 

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:09.096
 In the third figure we see the example from a fan that has been "clogged" by the dust, resulting in either not turning properly or burning. 

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:16.135
 A burning fan may result in total or partial destruction of your motherboard or graphics card. 

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:24.611
 In the fourth picture we have another example of a fan that has been clogged with dust. 

00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:33.488
 The dust can also cause one or more impellers to fall on the fan as you can see in the picture of this example. 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 The increased temperature but also the passage of time 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.100
 result in drying the thermal paste on the processor heat sink and the laptop's graphics card, 

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:48.780
 so the correct temperature escape from the surface does not occur. 

00:01:49.524 --> 00:01:51.520
 Here you can see the dry hot pasta. 

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:55.510
 The same in this picture. 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 Same here. 

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:03.880
 At the dedicated laptop service at ALLSOFT 

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:09.400
 we take the full cleaning inside the Laptop at a very low cost 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 removing dust completely and replacing thermal paste or thermal pads with a new one. 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 See the following pictures below. 

00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:22.880
 First remove the dry thermal paste 

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:31.900
 Clean with chemicals so the CPU chip and the GPU (BGA) become the same as the image you see. 

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:36.890
 Then we replace the thermal paste of the CPU with a new one 

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:40.390
 or if the Laptop factory had a thermal pad instead of a thermal paste 

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:43.190
 then replace it with a new pad. 

00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:49.590
 On the graphics card we put special thermal paste which is 99% Silver, 

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:53.190
 to get even better brush contact with the BGA of graphics 

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.290
 and better absorption of temperature 

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:00.730
 since silver is a much better temperature conductor than any other material. 

00:03:03.714 --> 00:03:05.710
 We clean the fan impellers with cotton swabs 

00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:08.890
 to completely remove the dust that has stuck on it. 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.690
 And in some fans that are factory-made feasible, 

00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:17.290
 lubricate them with special oil. (mainly in older laptop technology. 

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:24.020
 This must be done every 6-12 months. 

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:28.400
 If your laptop is under warranty 

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.390
 then you should wait for the warranty to expire 

00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:32.950
 or contact the delegation for cleaning. 

00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:36.120
 The cost of cleaning a laptop in our company 

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:39.390
 we are very low as well as other work 

00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:41.020
 and our spare parts. 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.890
 Cleaning can take place on the same day 

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.300
 if you come by appointment. 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.130
 Close an appointment today 

00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:49.300
 before it's too late for your laptop.
