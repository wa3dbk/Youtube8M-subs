 Four days 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 I will 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.970
 Hmm

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.590
 I am 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.510
 is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.040
 Four days 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.880
 And was 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.880
 is 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.250
 Four 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.210
 Number 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.180
 I 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.140
 Four days 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.070
 Was I 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.790
 Four days 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.790
 Was I 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.549
 And was 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:18.520
 It may not be said or the weight is a weight of 1540 grams 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:23.950
 Though I think that crash ride fixture do not know well or rush the 7th ride of the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.290
 8 I'm in the Ride category, but I think it's a crash 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.460
 I think the shape is a little crash 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.960
 Since the spread is I feel that there is to rather than a heavier guy of Dechotto crash in say 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.540
 Even though it's a difficult place 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.400
 8 bells 18 inches relatively large and firmly 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.260
 I'm clean this particular crash amazing beautiful even if Well crash door fusion Mr. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.670
 a 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.700
 Kai of this addition or two properly continuity and ward us into the great clean there is no turbidity 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.510
 It is a form that there is also darkness 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.230
 The sound when Ping-Wing-Et wins here is also great. 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.750
 It will appear in clarity or with a variety do in one this 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.960
 eh 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 Usually there are more 20 and 18 inches or 21 and 161 combinations. 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.200
 But 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.060
 1618 is Toka 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:19.709
 When it's time to do it, this is the top at the top. Hey, the top cymbal here. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.090
 It 's about cymbals , I think it's okay to have cymbals that don't seem to be light cymbals. 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.890
 I think 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.230
 a 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.970
 This is it 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:34.180
 It's a great name is good to crash Tsu ride to do with a single really is after 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:40.120
 And that it is I feel it 's kana really only if cymbals say is 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.900
 I thought is better to think of me something or crash of the one light of the attempts to wonder what was the floor 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.560
 You 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.329
 Well I want to crash or do I want to crash in this cymbal? 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.780
 If you don't want to do something like you're going to feel like you're going to be a bit tired 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.970
 Including 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.420
 Most of the time, it's not that I can't really use anything there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.069
 Become 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:06.230
 It feels like you can use anything and I am very worried about the recommendation 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:10.340
 It feels like this is a cymbal, but you can not make two identical cymbals. 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.770
 If you like it is the sound you wish Regards So of Shirai music Shiraito Shimizu 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.250
 was 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.250
 Ah ah ah ah
