okay<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> be<00:00:02.220> demonstrating<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:03.030> two

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay I'm going to be demonstrating a two

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.419 
okay I'm going to be demonstrating a two
loop<00:00:03.540> braid<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:04.200> short<00:00:04.589> loops<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:07.189> this<00:00:08.189> is

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
loop braid with short loops and this is

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.720 
loop braid with short loops and this is
also<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.320> basic<00:00:10.320> move<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
also the basic move for the for the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.640 
also the basic move for the for the
spiral<00:00:12.179> braid<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:13.469> lace<00:00:13.710> Bend<00:00:14.250> round<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:15.650> all

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
spiral braid the lace Bend round of all

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.429 
spiral braid the lace Bend round of all
various<00:00:17.430> numbers<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.940> loops<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:19.109> we'll<00:00:19.260> start

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
various numbers of loops but we'll start

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.960 
various numbers of loops but we'll start
with<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.980> loot<00:00:20.189> braid<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
with this to loot braid which is a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.200 
with this to loot braid which is a
really<00:00:21.210> fun<00:00:21.480> easy<00:00:21.750> grade<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:23.119> there's<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
really fun easy grade to do there's a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.420 
really fun easy grade to do there's a
few<00:00:24.449> different<00:00:24.720> ways<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> accomplish<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
few different ways to accomplish the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.230 
few different ways to accomplish the
very<00:00:26.640> simple<00:00:27.029> move<00:00:27.240> basically<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:29.609> left<00:00:29.970> loop

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
very simple move basically the left loop

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
very simple move basically the left loop
is<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:31.019> through<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.009> loop

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is going to go through the right loop

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.180 
is going to go through the right loop
and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.759> loops<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.149> switch<00:00:33.420> hand<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
and the two loops will switch hand and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.709 
and the two loops will switch hand and
in<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.430> doing<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.850> left<00:00:36.030> foot<00:00:36.180> will<00:00:36.329> also<00:00:36.540> get

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
in so doing the left foot will also get

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.220 
in so doing the left foot will also get
a<00:00:36.750> turn<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> put

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a turn the one way to do this is to put

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
a turn the one way to do this is to put
the<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.469> loop<00:00:40.680> onto<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> left<00:00:41.340> finger<00:00:41.899> keep

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the right loop onto the left finger keep

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
the right loop onto the left finger keep
the<00:00:43.170> finger<00:00:43.530> inside<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> loop<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.700> then

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the finger inside the loop and then

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.350 
the finger inside the loop and then
reach<00:00:45.210> above<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.110> left<00:00:46.350> loop<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.950> other<00:00:47.039> loop

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
reach above the left loop the other loop

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.260 
reach above the left loop the other loop
and<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.770> hook<00:00:49.770> downwardly<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> pull

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and just hook downwardly on it and pull

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
and just hook downwardly on it and pull
it<00:00:51.300> through<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:53.809> get<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> off<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> finger<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it through and get it off the finger and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.160 
it through and get it off the finger and
it<00:00:56.219> gets<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:57.120> turn<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> comes<00:00:58.020> off

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it gets a little turn as it comes off

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
it gets a little turn as it comes off
that<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.859> very<00:00:59.160> important<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that way which is very important or you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.100 
that way which is very important or you
get<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.379> braid<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:02.539> it's<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:03.719> important

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
get a braid that's it's very important

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
get a braid that's it's very important
for<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> turn<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.510> I'm<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
for it to get that turn so I'm going to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.670 
for it to get that turn so I'm going to
do<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> again

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
do this again

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
do this again
I'm<00:01:08.010> putting<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> loop<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.540> loop<00:01:09.720> onto

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
I'm putting the loop the right loop onto

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
I'm putting the loop the right loop onto
the<00:01:10.470> left<00:01:10.920> finger<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> reaching<00:01:11.939> above<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the left finger and reaching above the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.130 
the left finger and reaching above the
left<00:01:12.780> loop<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:14.640> hook<00:01:14.820> downwardly<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
left loop to hook downwardly on it and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.859 
left loop to hook downwardly on it and
pull<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.680> off<00:01:17.960> leaving<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> right<00:01:19.590> loop<00:01:19.860> there

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
pull it off leaving the right loop there

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
pull it off leaving the right loop there
typing<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:26.009> handed<00:01:26.369> version<00:01:26.549> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
typing this is a right handed version I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
typing this is a right handed version I
will<00:01:26.880> also<00:01:27.270> show<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.960> left-handed<00:01:28.560> version<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
will also show a left-handed version of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
will also show a left-handed version of
this<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.490> left-handed<00:01:29.790> you're

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this so if you're left-handed you're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.410 
this so if you're left-handed you're
watching<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> wrong<00:01:31.740> video<00:01:32.150> unless<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> can

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
watching the wrong video unless you can

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.069 
watching the wrong video unless you can
do<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> mirror<00:01:34.650> image<00:01:35.009> maybe<00:01:35.930> there<00:01:36.930> are

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
do this mirror image maybe there are

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.260 
do this mirror image maybe there are
various<00:01:37.530> ways<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.460> left<00:01:39.000> loop

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
various ways to get this left loop

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.560 
various ways to get this left loop
through<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.619> way<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
through this is one way and this is I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.280 
through this is one way and this is I
think<00:01:42.570> pretty<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> do

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
think pretty much the way I like to do

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.020 
think pretty much the way I like to do
do<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.470> move<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> spiral<00:01:47.520> braid<00:01:47.790> but

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
do this move for the spiral braid but

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.670 
do this move for the spiral braid but
there<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.479> other<00:01:48.689> ways<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.140> end<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.470> doing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there are some other ways I end up doing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.210 
there are some other ways I end up doing
this<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.520> loop<00:01:50.670> grade<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:52.380> example<00:01:52.470> if

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
this for a to loop grade for example if

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.260 
this for a to loop grade for example if
you<00:01:54.000> put<00:01:54.030> two<00:01:54.659> fingers<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:56.009> loop

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
you put two fingers into the right loop

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.080 
you put two fingers into the right loop
you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> separate<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.799> reach

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you can separate it and you can reach

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
you can separate it and you can reach
this<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.540> easy<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.439> reach

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this is a very easy way you can reach

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.149 
this is a very easy way you can reach
over<00:02:01.979> grab<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.060> top<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> left<00:02:04.200> loop<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
over grab the top of the left loop and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.230 
over grab the top of the left loop and
as<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.579> pull<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.820> through<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:07.259> left

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
as you pull it through the left

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.120 
as you pull it through the left
can<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:08.870> kind<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.200> come<00:02:09.470> up<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.800> grab<00:02:10.100> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
can just kind of come up and grab the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.830 
can just kind of come up and grab the
right<00:02:10.550> loop<00:02:10.790> it's<00:02:11.240> alright

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
right loop it's alright

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.500 
right loop it's alright
I<00:02:11.870> like<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.410> way<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:13.190> hard<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.670> diagram<00:02:14.270> but

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I like this way it's hard to diagram but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.960 
I like this way it's hard to diagram but
it's<00:02:14.630> very<00:02:14.720> easy<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.070> then<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.760> reach

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
it's very easy to do and then you reach

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.430 
it's very easy to do and then you reach
a<00:02:17.300> separate<00:02:18.140> right<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.100> put<00:02:19.340> two<00:02:19.460> fingers<00:02:19.670> in

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
a separate right and put two fingers in

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.350 
a separate right and put two fingers in
open<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.470> loop<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.830> bit<00:02:22.010> reach<00:02:22.730> over<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.090> my

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
open the loop a bit reach over with my

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.880 
open the loop a bit reach over with my
index<00:02:23.840> finger<00:02:24.460> I'm<00:02:25.460> going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.700> grab<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.210> top

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
index finger I'm going to grab the top

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.370 
index finger I'm going to grab the top
of<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.670> other<00:02:28.880> loop<00:02:29.180> start<00:02:29.990> pulling<00:02:30.260> it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
of the other loop start pulling it

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.690 
of the other loop start pulling it
through<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.190> pull<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.430> through<00:02:31.670> I

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
through and I think pull it through I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.950 
through and I think pull it through I
just<00:02:31.880> catch<00:02:33.820> what<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.060> left<00:02:35.270> finger<00:02:35.750> just

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
just catch what the left finger just

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.780 
just catch what the left finger just
kind<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.200> comes<00:02:36.380> up<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.680> catches<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.370> loop

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
kind of comes up and catches the loop

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.300 
kind of comes up and catches the loop
that<00:02:38.500> supposed<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.070> works

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
that supposed to have and this works

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.350 
that supposed to have and this works
very<00:02:43.520> well<00:02:43.580> with<00:02:43.940> short<00:02:44.450> loops<00:02:46.210> that's<00:02:47.210> why

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
very well with short loops that's why

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.820 
very well with short loops that's why
we're<00:02:47.540> doing<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.810> I'm<00:02:47.990> doing<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.320> very<00:02:48.410> short

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
we're doing it I'm doing a very short

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.090 
we're doing it I'm doing a very short
braid<00:02:49.130> here<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.670> show<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.120> method<00:02:53.920> at<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
braid here to show this method at the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.230 
braid here to show this method at the
top<00:02:56.710> this<00:02:57.710> will<00:02:57.770> not<00:02:58.310> make<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> braid<00:02:58.970> if<00:02:59.150> I

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
top this will not make a braid if I

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.720 
top this will not make a braid if I
reach<00:02:59.480> through<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.380> other<00:03:00.500> loop<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.100> take

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
reach through the other loop and take

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.720 
reach through the other loop and take
the<00:03:01.940> loop<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:03.380> way<00:03:03.740> it<00:03:03.890> will<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.370> way<00:03:04.580> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the loop that way it will this way it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.820 
the loop that way it will this way it
would<00:03:04.850> not<00:03:05.150> get<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.570> turn<00:03:05.900> blue<00:03:06.320> loop<00:03:06.500> would<00:03:06.650> not

would not get a turn blue loop would not

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.400 
would not get a turn blue loop would not
get<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> turn<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.580> came<00:03:07.700> over<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.380> happen<00:03:09.380> to

get a turn as it came over I happen to
be<00:03:09.590> grabbing<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.130> top<00:03:10.490> of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.270> loop<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.660> turn

be grabbing the top of the loop to turn

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.900 
be grabbing the top of the loop to turn
it<00:03:11.990> you<00:03:12.260> could<00:03:12.530> also<00:03:12.680> grab<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.340> bottom<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.790> the

it you could also grab the bottom of the
loop<00:03:14.030> if<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.300> had<00:03:14.420> started<00:03:14.960> that<00:03:14.990> way<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.710> would

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
loop if I had started that way it would

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.430 
loop if I had started that way it would
be<00:03:15.860> fine<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:17.600> going<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> be<00:03:17.960> strange<00:03:18.320> to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
be fine but it is going to be strange to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.670 
be fine but it is going to be strange to
switch<00:03:18.860> mid<00:03:19.130> gray<00:03:19.510> either<00:03:20.510> way<00:03:20.900> grabbing<00:03:21.560> from

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
switch mid gray either way grabbing from

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.060 
switch mid gray either way grabbing from
above<00:03:22.300> or<00:03:23.300> grabbing<00:03:23.630> from<00:03:23.960> poking<00:03:24.530> from<00:03:24.650> below

above or grabbing from poking from below
either<00:03:25.730> way<00:03:26.000> will<00:03:26.180> give<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.540> loop<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:27.050> turn<00:03:27.860> as

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
either way will give the loop a turn as

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.870 
either way will give the loop a turn as
it<00:03:28.430> comes<00:03:28.640> through<00:03:29.560> which<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.770> it<00:03:31.400> needs<00:03:31.670> to

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
it comes through which is it needs to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.760 
it comes through which is it needs to
have<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.570> tend<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.350> grab<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.740> top

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.440 

I'll<00:03:40.490> show<00:03:40.700> this<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.910> bit<00:03:41.120> faster<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.240> very

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
I'll show this a bit faster it's a very

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.930 
I'll show this a bit faster it's a very
fun<00:03:44.810> braid<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.380> make<00:03:45.490> because<00:03:46.490> you<00:03:46.520> can<00:03:46.760> go

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
fun braid to make because you can go

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.860 
fun braid to make because you can go
really<00:03:47.210> fast

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
really fast

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.460 
really fast
you<00:03:48.230> soon<00:03:48.500> but<00:03:48.740> it's<00:03:49.810> not<00:03:50.810> necessary

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
you soon but it's not necessary

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.920 
you soon but it's not necessary
do<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.340> slowly<00:03:52.640> oh<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.910> see<00:03:53.300> I'm<00:03:53.390> putting<00:03:53.690> two

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
do it slowly oh I see I'm putting two

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.990 
do it slowly oh I see I'm putting two
fingers<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.530> both<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.100> them<00:03:55.280> maybe<00:03:55.670> that's<00:03:55.880> a

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
fingers in both of them maybe that's a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.460 
fingers in both of them maybe that's a
good<00:03:56.030> way<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.360> do<00:03:56.570> it<00:04:02.380> she's<00:04:03.380> grabbing<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.130> top

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:40.900 

go<00:04:09.470> back<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.830> one<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:39.770> helps<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.250> braid<00:04:40.490> being

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
go back to one it helps the braid being

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.180 
go back to one it helps the braid being
as<00:04:41.120> neat<00:04:41.480> as<00:04:41.630> it<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.960> be<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.230> is<00:04:42.320> great<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> bit

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
as neat as it can be it is great a bit

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.290 
as neat as it can be it is great a bit
hard<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.490> make<00:04:43.700> me<00:04:43.910> ugly<00:04:45.130> if<00:04:46.130> you<00:04:46.310> don't<00:04:46.490> let<00:04:46.970> a

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
hard to make me ugly if you don't let a

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.590 
hard to make me ugly if you don't let a
lot<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.870> slack<00:04:48.670> happen<00:04:49.670> in<00:04:49.790> your<00:04:49.910> loop<00:04:50.120> so<00:04:50.480> I'm

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
lot of slack happen in your loop so I'm

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.090 
lot of slack happen in your loop so I'm
trying<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:50.990> keep<00:04:51.140> them<00:04:51.320> I'm<00:04:51.440> not<00:04:51.560> point<00:04:51.860> very

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
trying to keep them I'm not point very

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.210 
trying to keep them I'm not point very
hard<00:04:52.400> but<00:04:52.670> I'm<00:04:52.760> trying<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.090> let<00:04:53.300> them<00:04:54.220> have

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
hard but I'm trying to let them have

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.720 
hard but I'm trying to let them have
them<00:04:55.400> be<00:04:55.550> straight<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.450> not
