00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.520
 4 th 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 welcome to the lesson the 4 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.300
 about the use of capello 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 in this lesson you will explain what a k pole is 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.690
 but to use a cable now 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 and how you use broken 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410
 what is a cable 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 the cape also pat broken too damaged or broken castro 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.420
 has come true clamp 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.040
 who clamps up on the neck at sita 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.770
 hoping to tune the guitars 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.430
 whatever you do is make the string length of the guitar 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.760
 which makes the iq sound higher 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.650
 there are different kapos 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.110
 You have and there are hijackers who also pinch the heavy part 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 I broke like this 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.580
 who really lost out 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.580
 and you also have a litigation on claims 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.740
 make sure when purchasing a capello that you ask Kevin in the guitar shop 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.120
 then hijack for your guitar 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.740
 what is the difference in being broken for one 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 spanish guitar wester vita about electric guitar 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.710
 anyway i'm not asking myself completely naked 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 in the guitar only and she can advise you well in that 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.970
 why could you use it anyway 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.010
 well that aims for a number of reasons 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.270
 the reason is that if you also want to play chords only in one 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.020
 higher key also a key other than 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.800
 but the Kurds are in 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.160
 the couple that you have learned a song and decide for the games 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.790
 you can through per claim you can still play if that how they 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.930
 that is, for example, the voice range of his people 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.089
 on the singer 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.189
 it can't be added to that, so you can easily do it with the kapo 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.119
 you can change the pitch without having to chord 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.309
 modify 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.809
 and on a record in the COCO also a lot of nice pot occurs much more often 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:21.979
 the in folk music 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.149
 that you determined the word corrupt 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.149
 who just drink nicely together 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.839
 that you still have to sort or play another x, you can easily hijack that 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.559
 use 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.709
 simplified placement of broken items 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.760
 that trend this habit to fight the neck of the guitar just behind 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.469
 and not halfway between two flats 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.120
 This is in accordance with our noises to prevent m from making the guitar 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.469
 vote well 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.939
 sometimes pressing for the wk for a while so that it fits in well with the test 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.979
 on the basis of the song in the circulation of marino 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.059
 I'm going to give it a chorus and play and sing 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.059
 I'm going to let you hear the song 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.839
 the difference is 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:09.799
 and without capello 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.479
 it is the first and with capello the original pitch is as on the 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.659
 plate 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.410
 and then the camera does 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.979
 and then let you hear how the guitar sounds and how you sink 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.979
 when the cape is conceived 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 the drilling 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.959
 then you want to 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:38.839
 Rome 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.549
 I 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.869
 a date that 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.869
 a nice huh 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.219
 that is the original heaps on the spot so quickly 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.039
 talking with each other 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.439
 play the chords again 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.439
 And then you see brands that guitarists complain 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.139
 judo billion 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.139
 he just doesn't want to fall 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 the in the 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.729
 that is one 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.749
 a way to use your broken you notice a lot lower 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.900
 and if you do, I have something in public 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.289
 from time to time too low to sing along 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.029
 use wk pool 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.680
 higher on the if 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.569
 so you can sing 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.710
 in my knee book 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.439
 tips and trucks for the beginning guitarists 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.590
 you will also find a complete overview 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.240
 but more at that time 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.190
 how to place yourself broken and in which mess you play each other 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.159
 can play thereby 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.509
 refer the degradant 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.330
 and and then i hope you get so angry in this lesson that you know how you are 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.900
 broken to use when you can use 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.039
 and then we will vote in the next lesson 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.219
 and get to know how they do arts in 3 different ways 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.759
 so I like to see the following video 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:18.819
 beh 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:19.129
 the
