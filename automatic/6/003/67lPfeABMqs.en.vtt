talked about in the first podcast we
talked<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> linear<00:00:20.430> view<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.820> strategy

presented an alternative view of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.250 
presented an alternative view of
strategy<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> loop<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.360> managers<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.140> go

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
strategy as a loop that managers can go

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
strategy as a loop that managers can go
through<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.739> terms<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.100> making<00:00:35.309> sense<00:00:35.760> making

through in terms of making sense making
choices<00:00:36.559> making<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> happen<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.100> making

revisions in it this podcast will talk
about<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.290> happen<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
about how you can make that happen in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.729 
about how you can make that happen in
your<00:00:43.800> own<00:00:43.980> organizations<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.469> many

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
your own organizations so there are many

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
your own organizations so there are many
things<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.670> either<00:00:47.879> help<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.420> hinder<00:00:48.480> the

things that either help or hinder the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
things that either help or hinder the
strategic<00:00:49.860> loop<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.219> practice<00:00:50.760> there's<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
strategic loop in practice there's the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.000 
strategic loop in practice there's the
information<00:00:51.629> systems<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.680> place

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
information systems you have in place

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.700 
information systems you have in place
there's<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.969> culture<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> organization

there's the culture of the organization
there's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> organizational<00:00:57.270> structure

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
there's the organizational structure

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
there's the organizational structure
many<00:00:57.809> things<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.260> course<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.980> what's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
many things of course but what's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.610 
many things of course but what's
interesting<00:00:59.250> one<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> most<00:01:00.719> important

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
interesting one of the most important

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.910 
interesting one of the most important
either<00:01:01.829> obstacles<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:03.000> enablers<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.080> putting

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
either obstacles or enablers of putting

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
either obstacles or enablers of putting
the<00:01:05.010> strategic<00:01:05.519> loop<00:01:05.670> into<00:01:05.939> practice<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> how

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the strategic loop into practice is how

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.399 
the strategic loop into practice is how
good<00:01:07.710> managers<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.299> leading<00:01:10.110> discussions

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
good managers are at leading discussions

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.130 
good managers are at leading discussions
in<00:01:10.950> each<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> four<00:01:11.610> stages<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.900> I've

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
in each of the four stages and what I've

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.810 
in each of the four stages and what I've
found<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.770> working<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> companies

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
found in working with a lot of companies

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
found in working with a lot of companies
and<00:01:15.119> managers<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> years<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and managers over the years are is that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
and managers over the years are is that
most<00:01:17.580> managers<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.210> good<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.750> two

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
most managers are good at one or two

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560 
most managers are good at one or two
stages<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.920> either<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:21.030> bad<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.540> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
stages and either really bad or just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830 
stages and either really bad or just
avoid<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.890> other<00:01:23.009> stages<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.659> I'd<00:01:24.750> like

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
avoid the other stages so what I'd like

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
avoid the other stages so what I'd like
to<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.200> quickly<00:01:25.409> talk<00:01:25.770> through<00:01:25.799> each<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to do is quickly talk through each of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
to do is quickly talk through each of
them<00:01:26.430> I'll<00:01:26.939> give<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.540> flavor<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
them I'll give you a little flavor of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
them I'll give you a little flavor of
what<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> takes<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
what it takes to make it work some of

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.760 
what it takes to make it work some of
the<00:01:29.759> common<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> common<00:01:30.540> obstacle<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.409> two<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the common a common obstacle or two and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
the common a common obstacle or two and
what<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.729> address<00:01:33.030> those<00:01:33.210> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
what you can do to address those so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
what you can do to address those so
let's<00:01:34.079> start<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.380> making<00:01:34.560> sense<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.670> goal

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
let's start with making sense the goal

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.160 
let's start with making sense the goal
in<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.600> step<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:38.040> observe<00:01:38.820> data<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.630> come

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
in this step is to observe data and come

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.510 
in this step is to observe data and come
to<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> shared<00:01:40.680> mental<00:01:40.890> model<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to a shared mental model of the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.609 
to a shared mental model of the
situation<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.810> sufficient<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.380> for

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
situation it's sufficient not for

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
situation it's sufficient not for
absolute<00:01:44.100> truth<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.939> through<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
absolute truth but to get through this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.100 
absolute truth but to get through this
iteration<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> tone<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
iteration so what is the tone of the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.539 
iteration so what is the tone of the
discussion<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> put<00:01:50.159> into<00:01:50.310> place

well you can do however is when someone

well you can do however is when someone
makes<00:02:22.879> an<00:02:23.090> action<00:02:23.269> proposal<00:02:23.959> rather<00:02:24.290> than

the<00:05:18.820> ways<00:05:18.970> this<00:05:19.180> goes<00:05:19.300> wrong<00:05:19.660> well<00:05:19.900> one<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
the ways this goes wrong well one of the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.860 
the ways this goes wrong well one of the
most<00:05:20.380> common<00:05:20.860> ways<00:05:21.039> this<00:05:21.789> goes<00:05:21.910> wrong<00:05:22.300> is<00:05:22.600> that

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
most common ways this goes wrong is that

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.650 
most common ways this goes wrong is that
people<00:05:23.560> search<00:05:24.400> out<00:05:24.729> information<00:05:25.240> that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
people search out information that

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.510 
people search out information that
confirms<00:05:25.919> what<00:05:26.919> they<00:05:27.039> wanted<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.370> believe

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
confirms what they wanted to believe

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.670 
confirms what they wanted to believe
rather<00:05:28.240> than<00:05:28.479> searching<00:05:29.229> out<00:05:29.440> information

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
rather than searching out information

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.740 
rather than searching out information
that<00:05:29.979> disconfirms<00:05:30.669> them<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.120> one<00:05:31.539> way<00:05:31.720> to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
that disconfirms them and one way to

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.080 
that disconfirms them and one way to
deal<00:05:32.050> with<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.380> is<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.919> bring<00:05:33.130> out<00:05:33.280> bring<00:05:33.760> in

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
deal with that is to bring out bring in

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.620 
deal with that is to bring out bring in
outsiders<00:05:35.039> into<00:05:36.039> the<00:05:36.130> revision<00:05:36.580> process<00:05:36.789> who

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
outsiders into the revision process who

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.350 
outsiders into the revision process who
are<00:05:37.720> less<00:05:38.039> emotionally<00:05:39.039> bound<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.610> this<00:05:39.789> who

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
are less emotionally bound to this who

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.510 
are less emotionally bound to this who
may<00:05:40.810> be<00:05:40.870> better<00:05:41.260> positioned<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.070> note

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
may be better positioned to note

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.560 
may be better positioned to note
disconfirming<00:05:43.349> information<00:05:44.349> so<00:05:45.389> it's<00:05:46.389> not

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
disconfirming information so it's not

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.870 
disconfirming information so it's not
easy<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.349> move<00:05:47.860> from<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.280> linear<00:05:48.550> view<00:05:48.729> of

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
easy to move from a linear view of

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.270 
easy to move from a linear view of
strategy<00:05:49.389> to<00:05:49.570> a<00:05:49.780> loop<00:05:50.080> view<00:05:50.289> of<00:05:50.470> strategy<00:05:51.099> but

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
strategy to a loop view of strategy but

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.190 
strategy to a loop view of strategy but
the<00:05:51.639> payoff<00:05:52.090> is<00:05:52.120> enormous<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.020> there<00:05:53.139> are

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
the payoff is enormous and there are

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.529 
the payoff is enormous and there are
many<00:05:53.530> companies<00:05:53.979> that<00:05:54.010> have<00:05:54.160> done<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.550> so<00:05:55.330> I

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
many companies that have done it so I
