00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that is so important and what I mean by

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
that is so important and what I mean by
that<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.030> say<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> bed<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
that is say you're going to bed and you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
that is say you're going to bed and you
realize<00:01:29.189> oh<00:01:29.400> no<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.030> supposed<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.509> running

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
realize oh no I'm supposed to be running
at<00:01:30.900> 6am<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.650> only<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.159> about

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
at 6am but I'm only going to get about

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
at 6am but I'm only going to get about
five<00:01:32.579> hours<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.880> sleep<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.900> recommend

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
five hours of sleep I actually recommend

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280 
five hours of sleep I actually recommend
skipping<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.400> run<00:01:35.610> sleeping<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.930> then

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
skipping your run sleeping in and then

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.770 
skipping your run sleeping in and then
running<00:01:37.560> later<00:01:37.920> sleep<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.939> vital<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
running later sleep is vital it's so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120 
running later sleep is vital it's so
important<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
important and you will see the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
important and you will see the
difference<00:01:41.400> from<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.390> runner<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> gets<00:01:42.990> sleep

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
difference from a runner that gets sleep

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
difference from a runner that gets sleep
and<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.619> runner<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.009> doesn't<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.460> sleep<00:01:44.750> okay

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and a runner that doesn't get sleep okay

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.960 
and a runner that doesn't get sleep okay
runners<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.860> important<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> make

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
