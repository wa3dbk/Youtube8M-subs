00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.349
 hello everyone and in this video we will 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 do tape puller or whip 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:17.520
 so for this we need two 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 a piece of chain 1 piece of 20 pigs second 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.010
 a piece of five beast 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.350
 steel plate and bolts with nuts 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:32.040
 diameter of 4 millimeters so first thing 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:36.360
 before we drill a hole in the chain in diameters 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.150
 4 mm made of hardened steel 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 so it is drilled poorly when drilling 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.460
 varna lubricate oil drill 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.120
 after those drilled on 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.840
 steel plate do the markup under 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840
 future holes 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.170
 for accuracy, we first drill 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 smaller diameter poster drill to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 four millimeters 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.200
 after all holes are made 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.190
 remove the burrs with a file or 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.190
 sandpaper 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.760
 further degreased and then painted 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.900
 after the paint is dry 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.900
 we assemble 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.050
 but 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.630
 to make it easier to keep the puller 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.630
 hand grip can put a piece of hose 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.140
 that's all our removable ready to go 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.000
