probably well over $30.00 and they
they're<00:03:14.120> really<00:03:14.420> rare<00:03:14.690> because<00:03:15.200> yes<00:03:16.010> there

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
they're really rare because yes there

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.710 
they're really rare because yes there
are<00:03:16.250> pretty<00:03:16.610> as<00:03:16.760> most<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.180> dragons<00:03:17.510> are

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
are pretty as most of the dragons are

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.010 
are pretty as most of the dragons are
but<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.500> takes<00:03:18.770> them<00:03:19.100> over<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.820> month<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.840> come

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
but it takes them over a month to come

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.170 
but it takes them over a month to come
back<00:03:21.200> into<00:03:21.380> gestation<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.790> drag<00:03:23.030> will

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
back into gestation so so this drag will

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.479 
back into gestation so so this drag will
not<00:03:23.270> be<00:03:23.360> able<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.540> agree<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:23.840> 29<00:03:24.230> days<00:03:24.530> usually

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
not be able to agree for 29 days usually

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.760 
not be able to agree for 29 days usually
31<00:03:26.300> days<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.900> takes<00:03:27.110> for<00:03:27.290> them<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.500> read<00:03:27.650> so

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
31 days it takes for them to read so

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.070 
31 days it takes for them to read so
that's<00:03:27.830> why<00:03:28.040> they're<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.250> expensive<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.239> it

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
that's why they're so expensive and it

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.449 
that's why they're so expensive and it
takes<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.650> long<00:03:30.950> time

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
takes a long time

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.369 
takes a long time
and<00:03:32.849> if<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> wait<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> whole<00:03:33.720> real

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
and if you have to wait a whole real

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.530 
and if you have to wait a whole real
month<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.730> breathe<00:03:35.939> these<00:03:36.090> things<00:03:36.269> again

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
month to breathe these things again

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.149 
month to breathe these things again
you're<00:03:36.870> gonna<00:03:36.989> sell<00:03:37.349> them<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.680> make<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:37.980> for

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
you're gonna sell them to make up for

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.860 
you're gonna sell them to make up for
that<00:03:38.189> and<00:03:38.700> they<00:03:38.879> don't<00:03:38.970> have<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> lot<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.480> babies

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
that and they don't have a lot of babies
