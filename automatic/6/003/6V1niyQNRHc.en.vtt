Phil nationally and well I wash it in

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.930 
Phil nationally and well I wash it in
default<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.070> I'll<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.460> like<00:03:14.610> yeah

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.940 
default and I'll just kind of like yeah
but<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:16.110> still<00:03:16.320> cooler<00:03:16.560> there's<00:03:16.800> not

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
but it's it's still cooler there's not

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.410 
but it's it's still cooler there's not
much<00:03:17.160> difference<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.670> mean<00:03:17.820> obviously<00:03:17.880> Togo<00:03:18.300> is

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
much difference I mean obviously Togo is

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.180 
much difference I mean obviously Togo is
different<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.560> main<00:03:19.740> thing<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:19.980> I'm

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
different but the main thing that I'm

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.980 
different but the main thing that I'm
still<00:03:20.520> kind<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.700> annoy<00:03:20.880> which<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.840> you're

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
still kind of annoy which not if you're

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.930 
still kind of annoy which not if you're
watching<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.920> fix

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
watching this you have to fix

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.080 
watching this you have to fix
well<00:03:24.750> not<00:03:25.020> fixed<00:03:25.380> but<00:03:25.500> add-in<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.160> if<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.970> can

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
well not fixed but add-in is if we can

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.660 
well not fixed but add-in is if we can
swap<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.870> lump<00:03:28.110> like<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> log<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:29.460> if<00:03:29.580> we

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
swap the lump like the log like if we

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.130 
swap the lump like the log like if we
can<00:03:29.790> reverse<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.120> basing<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.570> other<00:03:30.720> way

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
can reverse in basing the other way

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.350 
can reverse in basing the other way
yeah<00:03:31.770> like<00:03:31.950> rotate<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> 90<00:03:32.700> degrees<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.030> like

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
yeah like rotate it 90 degrees so like

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.000 
yeah like rotate it 90 degrees so like
