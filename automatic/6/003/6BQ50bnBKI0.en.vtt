00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.220 

biological<00:00:10.250> anthropologists<00:00:11.110> basically<00:00:12.110> are

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
biological anthropologists basically are

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.359 
biological anthropologists basically are
in<00:00:12.260> three<00:00:13.190> areas<00:00:13.549> they<00:00:14.240> look<00:00:14.750> at<00:00:15.369> evolution

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
in three areas they look at evolution

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.390 
in three areas they look at evolution
and<00:00:16.840> sort<00:00:17.840> of<00:00:17.900> fossil<00:00:18.230> evidence<00:00:18.410> and<00:00:18.980> that

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
and sort of fossil evidence and that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.310 
and sort of fossil evidence and that
also<00:00:19.580> extends<00:00:20.150> into<00:00:20.300> looking<00:00:20.720> at<00:00:20.810> forensic

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
also extends into looking at forensic

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.519 
also extends into looking at forensic
type<00:00:21.470> evidence<00:00:22.360> so<00:00:23.360> people<00:00:24.020> killed<00:00:24.320> people

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
type evidence so people killed people

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.230 
type evidence so people killed people
essentially<00:00:25.009> it's<00:00:25.310> hard<00:00:25.550> to<00:00:25.699> tell<00:00:25.910> whether

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
essentially it's hard to tell whether

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.450 
essentially it's hard to tell whether
all<00:00:26.510> his<00:00:26.840> teeth<00:00:27.050> are<00:00:27.320> erupted<00:00:27.890> because<00:00:28.310> he's

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
all his teeth are erupted because he's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.060 
all his teeth are erupted because he's
lost<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.150> many<00:00:29.300> of<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.960> mid-life<00:00:30.289> do<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:30.920> see

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
lost so many of the mid-life do you see

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.549 
lost so many of the mid-life do you see
all<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:31.490> bone<00:00:31.820> resort<00:00:32.419> aliens<00:00:32.870> that's<00:00:33.199> right

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
all this bone resort aliens that's right

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.590 
all this bone resort aliens that's right
so<00:00:34.010> that<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.370> not<00:00:34.519> a<00:00:34.550> tooth<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:34.970> has<00:00:35.300> dropped

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
so that is not a tooth that has dropped

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.259 
so that is not a tooth that has dropped
out<00:00:35.840> after<00:00:36.170> death<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.580> tooth<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.120> was

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
out after death that is a tooth that was

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.420 
out after death that is a tooth that was
lost<00:00:38.540> in<00:00:38.930> life<00:00:39.080> and<00:00:39.739> we're<00:00:39.860> quite<00:00:39.949> interested

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
lost in life and we're quite interested

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.790 
lost in life and we're quite interested
in<00:00:40.550> human<00:00:40.850> sexual<00:00:41.180> behavior<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.020> sort<00:00:42.739> of

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
in human sexual behavior and sort of

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.950 
in human sexual behavior and sort of
branching<00:00:43.160> into<00:00:43.280> individual<00:00:43.850> psychology<00:00:44.180> so

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
branching into individual psychology so

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.420 
branching into individual psychology so
for<00:00:45.260> example<00:00:45.620> I'm<00:00:45.710> very<00:00:45.739> interested<00:00:46.309> in

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
for example I'm very interested in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.970 
for example I'm very interested in
reproductive<00:00:47.090> scheduling<00:00:47.719> when<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.829> have<00:00:48.950> a

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
reproductive scheduling when to have a

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.610 
reproductive scheduling when to have a
baby<00:00:49.250> how<00:00:49.850> many<00:00:50.090> babies<00:00:50.780> said<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:51.410> should

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
baby how many babies said you should

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.619 
baby how many babies said you should
have<00:00:51.649> how<00:00:52.129> many<00:00:52.190> can<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.760> afford<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.270> have<00:00:53.480> in

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
have how many can you afford to have in

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.750 
have how many can you afford to have in
terms<00:00:53.870> of<00:00:53.989> your<00:00:54.050> time<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.590> energy<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.280> also

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
terms of your time and energy and also

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.979 
terms of your time and energy and also
when<00:00:56.149> should<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.390> start<00:00:56.480> something

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
when should you start something

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.380 
when should you start something
interesting<00:00:57.559> in<00:00:57.680> teenage<00:00:58.160> mothers<00:00:58.550> why<00:00:59.090> maybe

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
interesting in teenage mothers why maybe

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.880 
interesting in teenage mothers why maybe
delay<00:00:59.660> to<00:00:59.719> start<00:00:59.989> having<00:01:00.200> children<00:01:00.320> at<00:01:00.739> a

delay to start having children at a

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.959 
delay to start having children at a
younger<00:01:01.039> age<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.489> what<00:01:01.610> are<00:01:01.699> some<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
younger age and what are some of the

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.819 
younger age and what are some of the
reasons<00:01:02.300> behind<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.840> from<00:01:03.500> an<00:01:03.590> evolutionary

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
reasons behind that from an evolutionary

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.609 
reasons behind that from an evolutionary
perspective<00:01:04.570> biological<00:01:05.570> anthropology<00:01:06.380> is

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
perspective biological anthropology is

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.460 
perspective biological anthropology is
the<00:01:07.009> study<00:01:07.160> of<00:01:07.789> humans<00:01:08.390> from<00:01:09.080> both<00:01:09.320> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
the study of humans from both the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.560 
the study of humans from both the
physiological<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.250> psychological

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
physiological and psychological

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.120 
physiological and psychological
perspective<00:01:11.570> trying<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.289> understand<00:01:12.800> how<00:01:13.070> we

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
perspective trying to understand how we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.520 
perspective trying to understand how we
have<00:01:13.580> adapted<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.420> world<00:01:14.600> around<00:01:14.930> us<00:01:15.200> so

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
have adapted to the world around us so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.590 
have adapted to the world around us so
what<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.770> want<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.280> know<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.670> on<00:01:16.880> balance<00:01:17.119> are

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
what I want to know is on balance are

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.530 
what I want to know is on balance are
you<00:01:17.869> an<00:01:17.990> advertiser<00:01:18.619> or<00:01:19.040> are<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> seeker

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
you an advertiser or are you a seeker

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.820 
you an advertiser or are you a seeker
and<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.049> we're<00:01:21.170> also<00:01:21.320> interested<00:01:21.619> in

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
and then we're also interested in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.170 
and then we're also interested in
primates<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:22.670> there<00:01:22.790> are<00:01:22.880> number<00:01:22.939> of

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
primates and so there are number of

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.030 
primates and so there are number of
people<00:01:23.510> in<00:01:23.600> anthropology<00:01:23.960> department<00:01:24.680> that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
people in anthropology department that

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.090 
people in anthropology department that
study<00:01:25.540> primates<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.720> try<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.170> understand<00:01:27.590> our

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
study primates to try and understand our

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.580 
study primates to try and understand our
human<00:01:28.490> emotion<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.030> human<00:01:29.450> behavior<00:01:29.600> one<00:01:30.500> of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
human emotion and human behavior one of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.170 
human emotion and human behavior one of
the<00:01:30.650> things<00:01:30.860> we<00:01:31.040> can<00:01:31.250> do<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.790> look<00:01:32.030> at

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
the things we can do is look at

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.010 
the things we can do is look at
non-human<00:01:32.900> primates<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.360> use<00:01:35.360> them<00:01:35.720> that

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
non-human primates and use them that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.920 
non-human primates and use them that
give<00:01:36.229> us<00:01:36.350> some<00:01:36.380> understanding<00:01:36.880> into<00:01:37.930> human

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
give us some understanding into human

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.260 
give us some understanding into human
evolution<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.860> why<00:01:40.250> humans<00:01:40.759> are<00:01:40.909> like<00:01:41.030> they

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
evolution and why humans are like they

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.420 
evolution and why humans are like they
are<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.689> human<00:01:42.170> evolution<00:01:42.680> focus<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.280> last

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
are a human evolution focus in the last

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.420 
are a human evolution focus in the last
7<00:01:43.909> million<00:01:44.150> years<00:01:44.360> of<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.920> development<00:01:46.369> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
7 million years of the development of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.370 
7 million years of the development of
our<00:01:46.520> own<00:01:46.579> species<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.659> looks<00:01:48.049> at<00:01:48.170> some<00:01:48.290> of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
our own species and it looks at some of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.740 
our own species and it looks at some of
the<00:01:48.439> key<00:01:48.590> aspects<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.189> where<00:01:50.000> biology<00:01:50.450> starts

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the key aspects of where biology starts

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.330 
the key aspects of where biology starts
to<00:01:50.840> meet<00:01:50.990> culture<00:01:51.439> where<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:51.890> start<00:01:52.159> to

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
to meet culture where we start to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.010 
to meet culture where we start to
manipulate<00:01:52.490> our<00:01:53.180> own<00:01:53.360> environment<00:01:53.869> rather

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
manipulate our own environment rather

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.690 
manipulate our own environment rather
than<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.320> environment<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.799> manipulating<00:01:55.579> us

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
than the environment and manipulating us

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.179 
than the environment and manipulating us
but<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.360> also<00:01:56.540> addresses<00:01:56.869> where<00:01:57.710> we're<00:01:57.890> going

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
but it also addresses where we're going
