00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.919 

so<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:00.930> finally<00:00:01.410> got<00:00:01.709> my<00:00:02.090> ebay<00:00:03.090> gimbal<00:00:03.540> pretty

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so I finally got my ebay gimbal pretty

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.120 
so I finally got my ebay gimbal pretty
well<00:00:04.049> sorted<00:00:04.380> out<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:05.270> DJI<00:00:06.270> phantom<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.130> I

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
well sorted out on my DJI phantom and I

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.720 
well sorted out on my DJI phantom and I
noticed<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:10.130> battery<00:00:11.130> life<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
noticed that the battery life on a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.879 
noticed that the battery life on a
single<00:00:11.820> battery<00:00:12.389> was<00:00:12.870> pretty<00:00:13.590> greatly

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
single battery was pretty greatly

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.490 
single battery was pretty greatly
decreased<00:00:14.490> when<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.179> flying<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
decreased when I was flying with the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
decreased when I was flying with the
gimbal<00:00:16.920> running<00:00:17.550> powered<00:00:18.119> off<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> same

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
gimbal running powered off of the same

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.540 
gimbal running powered off of the same
battery<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.279> invested<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.180> these<00:00:22.550> double

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
battery so I invested in these double

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.830 
battery so I invested in these double
battery<00:00:24.019> brackets<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:27.420> first<00:00:27.630> time

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
battery brackets here and the first time

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
battery brackets here and the first time
that<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.050> flew<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.650> mounted<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that I flew I actually mounted the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.740 
that I flew I actually mounted the
batteries<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.910> top<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.300> things

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
batteries on top of these things

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
batteries on top of these things
before<00:00:31.230> realizing<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.040> they're<00:00:32.309> supposed

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
before realizing that they're supposed

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.120 
before realizing that they're supposed
to<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.669> mounted<00:00:33.030> underneath<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to be mounted underneath so I'm going to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.610 
to be mounted underneath so I'm going to
mount<00:00:35.219> them<00:00:35.399> underneath<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.000> time<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.620> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
mount them underneath this time and and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.639 
mount them underneath this time and and
see<00:00:38.329> how<00:00:39.329> much<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> difference<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
see how much of a difference there is in

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.040 
see how much of a difference there is in
the<00:00:40.920> flight<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.399> between<00:00:41.719> single<00:00:42.719> battery

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the flight time between single battery

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.000 
the flight time between single battery
and<00:00:43.550> double<00:00:44.550> battery<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.680> ebay

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and double battery with the with my ebay

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.880 
and double battery with the with my ebay
gimbal<00:00:47.489> plugged<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.920

and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.019> I've<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.530> nifty<00:01:02.309> Y<00:01:02.670> adapter

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and then I've got this nifty Y adapter

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.320 
and then I've got this nifty Y adapter
which<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.989> 2<00:01:04.409> bucks<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.830> Amazon<00:01:05.330> to

which was like 2 bucks on Amazon to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.160 
which was like 2 bucks on Amazon to
connect<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.470> three<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.860> these<00:01:07.950> together<00:01:08.250> and

gimbal running off of it I was only
getting<00:01:42.020> about<00:01:42.200> four<00:01:42.710> minutes<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:43.250> flight

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
getting about four minutes of flight

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.260 
getting about four minutes of flight
time<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.920> got<00:01:46.490> these<00:01:46.700> double<00:01:47.119> battery

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
time so I got these double battery

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.060 
brackets hook them up you saw that and
just<00:01:49.479> flew<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:51.950> be<00:01:52.100> expecting<00:01:52.899> about

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
just flew and you can be expecting about

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.740 
just flew and you can be expecting about
seven<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.220> half<00:01:55.250> minutes<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:56.060> flight<00:01:56.720> time

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
seven and a half minutes of flight time

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.740 
seven and a half minutes of flight time
with<00:01:57.619> two<00:01:57.829> batteries<00:01:58.009> hooked<00:01:58.369> up<00:01:58.750> it

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
with two batteries hooked up it

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.600 
with two batteries hooked up it
definitely<00:02:00.229> definitely<00:02:00.829> feels<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.460> bit

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
definitely definitely feels a bit

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.880 
definitely definitely feels a bit
heavier<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:04.179> flies<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.210> little<00:02:05.539> bit<00:02:05.630> more

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
heavier and flies a little bit more

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.749 
heavier and flies a little bit more
sluggish<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:08.470> totally<00:02:09.470> doable<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.100> and

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
sluggish but it's totally doable and and

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.509 
sluggish but it's totally doable and and
not<00:02:11.569> too<00:02:11.780> much<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.170> an<00:02:12.290> amateur<00:02:12.709> like<00:02:13.190> me<00:02:13.250> to

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
not too much for an amateur like me to

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.410 
not too much for an amateur like me to
handle<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> only<00:02:17.000> other<00:02:17.090> thing

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
handle and then the only other thing

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.690 
handle and then the only other thing
here<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.890> bought<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:20.510> little

able to allow me to do tilt control but
I<00:02:30.860> have<00:02:31.099> not<00:02:31.220> figured<00:02:31.459> out<00:02:31.640> where<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.910> hook
