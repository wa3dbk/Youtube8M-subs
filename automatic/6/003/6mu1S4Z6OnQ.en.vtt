00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:28.609
 total pagro the little one of our 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.609
 story of our life and finally 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.039
 taking advantage of this moment that people 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.129
 was this wonderful here in victory of the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.129
 conquest 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:05.339
 And then for you, I enjoy it. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 time is not there and see the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.680
 family is not that it is our family's 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.680
 intimacy 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.830
 we just launched now I do not know just to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:26.369
 swing 11 which in my opinion treats 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.549
 quite unlike anything we've ever done 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.549
 so until always 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.409
 the inspections the songs were good 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.170
 has shown that he is ready to 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.429
 classically ready adilson himself 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.490
 anywhere anytime 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.179
 and I particularly think the disc is 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.210
 one of the best if not better because 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:03.350
 we can not say why they still come 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:05.869
 many out there for several sleepless nights 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.599
 after quality travel beyond 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.860
 Horizon is such a beautiful place. 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:16.540
 quiet 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:21.049
 the victory to conquer mateus idea 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.640
 14/10 say so it's talking here already say 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.970
 of our request is that we launched 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.829
 now just to rock and we stayed 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.590
 pay for a wave for us to do 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.880
 He gave in because he is and always depends 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.250
 from Thursday we had no way out of 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.480
 studio is that several improved loop 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.650
 several plays and lots of information and there 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.900
 I think 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:48.980
 but then the people are coming down rappelling 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:54.980
 iskander where the beast only covers that for 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.079
 to see what each shook only 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 to rock or from here you do not need 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.510
 playing does not have to win her now 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.430
 Come on, it's just you're going to release. 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.560
 everything swingue asks 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.850
 People, I 'm going to the galley, you understand. 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 today this is very important 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.200
 the guys are going on the page the show is not 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.299
 is going to rock more 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.870

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.870
