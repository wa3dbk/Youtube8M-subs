00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
was called the displaced single

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
was called the displaced single
paradiddle<00:00:19.320> challenge<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.220> took<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
paradiddle challenge and we took a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.250 
paradiddle challenge and we took a
single<00:00:20.910> paradiddle<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.960> learn<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
single paradiddle and just learn how to

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080 
single paradiddle and just learn how to
displace<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.100> every<00:00:23.279> possible<00:00:23.519> variation

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
displace it in every possible variation

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.029 
displace it in every possible variation
in<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> bar<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> sixteenth<00:00:25.199> notes<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.859> since

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
in a bar of sixteenth notes so since

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
in a bar of sixteenth notes so since
that<00:00:26.189> first<00:00:26.400> video<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.789> did<00:00:26.880> I've<00:00:27.390> done<00:00:27.630> quite<00:00:27.900> a

part two and we were taking some

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.200 
part two and we were taking some
variations<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.100> applying<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.820> single

variations and applying them to a single
paradiddle<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.680> groove<00:00:40.950> sound<00:00:41.250> way

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
paradiddle to make the groove sound way

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
paradiddle to make the groove sound way
cooler<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.600> lot<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.170> challenging<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
cooler and a lot more challenging and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.290 
cooler and a lot more challenging and
kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.660> difficult<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.640> wanted<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
kind of difficult so I wanted to make a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299 
kind of difficult so I wanted to make a
video<00:00:51.510> where<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.320> took<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> same<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
video where we took the same kind of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.439 
video where we took the same kind of
things<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.730> were<00:00:53.820> doing<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> last

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
things that we were doing in the last

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
things that we were doing in the last
one<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> applied<00:00:55.230> them<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> practice

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
one and applied them to like a practice

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.250 
one and applied them to like a practice
pad<00:00:56.520> exercise<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.390> practice<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
pad exercise so you can practice it you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
pad exercise so you can practice it you
know<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> pad<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.520> lap<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.000> your

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
know on the pad or on your lap with your

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.000 
know on the pad or on your lap with your
hands<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.989> whatever<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.859> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hands or you know whatever just to get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
hands or you know whatever just to get
this<00:01:02.129> stuff<00:01:02.340> together<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.329> build<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
this stuff together and really build a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
this stuff together and really build a
strong<00:01:03.989> foundation<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.549> things

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
strong foundation for for these things

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
strong foundation for for these things
so<00:01:06.090> when<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> bring<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> kit<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so when you bring them to the kit you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
so when you bring them to the kit you
know<00:01:07.500> you're<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.799> killing<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
know you're just killing it so so in

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.310 
know you're just killing it so so in
this<00:01:09.210> video<00:01:09.360> I'm<00:01:09.600> gonna<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.990> three

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this video I'm gonna take three

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
this video I'm gonna take three
variations<00:01:10.680> apply<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.119> single

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
variations apply them to the single

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.929 
variations apply them to the single
paradiddle<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.710> displace<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
paradiddle and and displace them in

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.210 
paradiddle and and displace them in
every<00:01:15.180> possible<00:01:15.360> way<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.530> bar<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.830> sixteenth

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
every possible way in a bar of sixteenth

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
every possible way in a bar of sixteenth
notes<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:17.939> variation<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.450> we're

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
notes so the first variation that we're

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
notes so the first variation that we're
going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> apply<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> play<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> single

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
going to apply is if you play a single

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.030 
going to apply is if you play a single
paradiddle<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:21.210> left<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:22.320> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
paradiddle right left right right that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
paradiddle right left right right that
one<00:01:23.310> left<00:01:23.610> note<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> happens<00:01:24.299> we're<00:01:24.540> just

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
one left note that happens we're just

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
one left note that happens we're just
going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.930> diddle<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> turns<00:01:26.070> into<00:01:26.220> two

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
going to diddle it so it turns into two

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850 
going to diddle it so it turns into two
left's<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.390> gonna<00:01:27.509> go<00:01:27.750> instead<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.439> right

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
left's so it's gonna go instead of right

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.090 
left's so it's gonna go instead of right
left<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.490> right<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.439> left<00:01:31.799> right

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
left right right we get right left right

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.069 
left right right we get right left right
right<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.450> apply<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
right and when you apply that to the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:49.730 
right and when you apply that to the
other<00:01:34.140> side<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> take<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
other side so if you take that and you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.109 
other side so if you take that and you
apply<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> displaced<00:01:50.820> single

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
apply it to the displaced single

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.280 
apply it to the displaced single
paradiddle<00:01:51.420> challenge<00:01:51.869> where<00:01:52.110> we're<00:01:52.200> gonna

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
paradiddle challenge where we're gonna

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800 
paradiddle challenge where we're gonna
move<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.829> accent<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.880> sixteenth<00:01:54.420> note<00:01:54.630> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
move the accent by one sixteenth note in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.580 
move the accent by one sixteenth note in
every<00:01:55.049> possible<00:01:55.229> way

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
every possible way

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.020 
every possible way
and<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> comes<00:01:56.189> around<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> left<00:01:56.880> hand

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and it comes around to the left hand

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
and it comes around to the left hand
then<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> left<00:01:57.750> hand<00:01:57.990> lead<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.500> sounds

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
then you do a left hand lead it sounds

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.390 
then you do a left hand lead it sounds
like<00:01:59.070> this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
like this

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:27.270 
like this
I<00:02:25.200> don't<00:02:26.200> know<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:26.950> way

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
I don't know about you but that's way

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
I don't know about you but that's way
cooler<00:02:27.640> than<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> regular<00:02:28.840> display

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
cooler than just the regular display

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.710 
cooler than just the regular display
single<00:02:29.950> paradiddle<00:02:30.220> challenge<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.090> adds<00:02:31.600> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
single paradiddle challenge it adds a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.980 
single paradiddle challenge it adds a
whole<00:02:31.750> other<00:02:32.020> dimension<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:34.660> me<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
whole other dimension and for me it just

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.500 
whole other dimension and for me it just
opens<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.830> whole<00:02:35.860> other<00:02:36.040> possibility<00:02:36.880> when

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
opens up a whole other possibility when

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.270 
opens up a whole other possibility when
I<00:02:37.540> bring<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.110> kit<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.650> next<00:02:38.890> variation

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
I bring it to the kit the next variation

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.410 
I bring it to the kit the next variation
we're<00:02:39.370> going<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.550> apply<00:02:39.700> variation<00:02:40.209> number

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
we're going to apply variation number

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.840 
we're going to apply variation number
two<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.840> uh<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:42.280> you're<00:02:42.400> playing<00:02:42.580> over<00:02:42.790> a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
two is uh when you're playing over a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.210 
two is uh when you're playing over a
single<00:02:43.060> paradiddle<00:02:43.450> again<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:44.380> left<00:02:44.590> right

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
single paradiddle again right left right

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.160 
single paradiddle again right left right
right<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.240> right<00:02:46.540> right<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.990> happens

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
right on that right right that happens

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.630 
right on that right right that happens
the<00:02:47.530> last<00:02:47.740> two<00:02:47.950> notes<00:02:48.160> we're<00:02:48.430> gonna<00:02:48.520> sneak

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the last two notes we're gonna sneak

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.760 
the last two notes we're gonna sneak
another<00:02:49.060> left<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.750> between<00:02:49.840> them<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.530> we<00:02:50.620> get

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
another left in between them so we get

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:06.300 
another left in between them so we get
right<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:05.080> if<00:03:05.140> we<00:03:05.260> take<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.620> variation<00:03:06.160> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
right so if we take that variation and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.590 
right so if we take that variation and
apply<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.880> display<00:03:07.150> single

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
apply it to the display single

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:33.920 
apply it to the display single
paradiddle<00:03:07.900> challenge<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:09.130> goes<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.519> this

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.090 

that<00:03:34.930> one's<00:03:35.110> super<00:03:35.260> fun<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.680> play<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:35.920> it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
that one's super fun to play and it

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.650 
that one's super fun to play and it
really<00:03:36.400> works<00:03:36.670> on<00:03:36.850> your<00:03:36.940> three<00:03:37.150> stroke<00:03:37.420> roll

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
really works on your three stroke roll

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.820 
really works on your three stroke roll
because<00:03:38.019> that's<00:03:38.230> exactly<00:03:38.590> what<00:03:38.709> you're<00:03:38.800> doing

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
because that's exactly what you're doing

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.170 
because that's exactly what you're doing
when<00:03:39.100> you're<00:03:39.190> sneaking<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.730> left<00:03:40.000> four<00:03:40.120> in

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
when you're sneaking that left four in

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.250 
when you're sneaking that left four in
there<00:03:40.420> which<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.810> pretty<00:03:40.959> cool

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
there which is pretty cool

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.500 
there which is pretty cool
and<00:03:41.470> also<00:03:42.070> another<00:03:42.519> rad<00:03:42.910> thing<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.360> move

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and also another rad thing to move

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.970 
and also another rad thing to move
around<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> kit<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.350> third<00:03:44.500> variation

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
around the kit so in the third variation

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.289 
around the kit so in the third variation
we're<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.280> adding<00:03:45.519> those<00:03:45.940> two<00:03:46.150> elements

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
we're just adding those two elements

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.539 
we're just adding those two elements
together<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.230> we're<00:03:47.320> doing<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.620> diddle<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.250> to

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
together so we're doing the diddle on to

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.920 
together so we're doing the diddle on to
the<00:03:48.670> double<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.120> then<00:03:49.209> we're<00:03:49.420> sneaking<00:03:49.630> that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the double and then we're sneaking that

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:06.420 
the double and then we're sneaking that
note<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.410> between<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.920> double<00:03:51.100> so<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:06.340> when

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
note in between the double so so when

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.039 
note in between the double so so when
you<00:04:06.519> apply<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.790> variation<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.660> displace

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
you apply that variation to the displace

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.690 
you apply that variation to the displace
single<00:04:08.350> parallel<00:04:08.650> challenge<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.310> sounds<00:04:09.579> like

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
single parallel challenge it sounds like

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:34.230 
single parallel challenge it sounds like
this

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.240 

so<00:04:35.240> yeah<00:04:35.390> those<00:04:35.630> are<00:04:35.690> three<00:04:36.140> three<00:04:36.770> ways<00:04:37.010> that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
so yeah those are three three ways that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.980 
so yeah those are three three ways that
you<00:04:37.340> can<00:04:37.520> spice<00:04:37.910> up<00:04:37.940> your<00:04:38.180> your<00:04:38.630> single

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
you can spice up your your single

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.660 
you can spice up your your single
paradiddles<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.650> found<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.190> these<00:04:40.370> three

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
paradiddles I found that these three

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.750 
paradiddles I found that these three
variations<00:04:41.240> are<00:04:41.420> super<00:04:42.320> applicable<00:04:43.190> to

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
variations are super applicable to

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.250 
variations are super applicable to
playing<00:04:44.150> these<00:04:44.300> on<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.570> drum<00:04:44.750> set<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.140> they

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
playing these on the drum set and they

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.350 
playing these on the drum set and they
really<00:04:45.470> free<00:04:45.740> up<00:04:45.920> behind<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.310> kit<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:46.670> check

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
really free up behind the kit so check

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.640 
really free up behind the kit so check
out<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.600> PDF<00:04:47.780> before<00:04:48.080> I've<00:04:48.380> got<00:04:48.620> a

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
out the PDF before I've got a

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.320 
out the PDF before I've got a
transcription<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.670> all<00:04:49.910> three<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.270> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
transcription of all three of the
