00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 and the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.740
 informed by that now maximum brings you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.840
 all the news from the world of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.860
 technology and videogames 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.480
 are magnetic and are still paying a few 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.580
 months we talk about a ruling against tony 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.560
 that forced the company to remunerate 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.420
 a group of users by the fall of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 playstation network and the consequent 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
 violation of your data and it seems that it is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.449
 the turn to pay again this time for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 misleading advertising the federal commission 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.679
 of US trade in control are 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.750
 guilty of having made notices of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.309
 playstation vita that did not correspond 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 with real functions of the laptop 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 some warnings implied that the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 console could be used in its mode 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 remote play any game 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 playstation3 and in fact they showed 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.329
 killzone3 although not even that game 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.920
 includes the function plus the possibility 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.510
 of abandoning a game in the middle of a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
 game and continue it on the console 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.899
 it was also promoted as one of the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.180
 better system characteristics 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 when he never really got in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 functioning and ultimately it 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.539
 suggested that it would be possible to use 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 multiplayer mode 3g connection of the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 portable but actually the function 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.420
 was limited to some 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 asynchronous and little else so 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 have purchased the console before 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.890
 first of June 2012 in the usa 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.619
 will receive about $ 25 refund or 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.210
 50 dollars of credit in psn are and never 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.300
 she was so happy to have sold 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 few views during the first year 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
 bronze goal but the company go pro is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 known for offering cameras 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 preferred by lovers of adventure and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 In fact there are many who have 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.630
 connected the tiny but powerful 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.580
 devices to drones to get shots 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.289
 impressive from the air but according to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.660
 Recent reports the company plans 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.670
 save a step for those users and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.220
 will begin to develop drones that already 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.560
 they will have cameras of the line go pro hero 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.300
 included that according to the information 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.399
 would target products from the segment of 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920
 between 500 and 1000 dollars a price that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.710
 could revolutionize the business market 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 as parrot and they have established themselves as 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.950
 the dominant brands in the environment and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840
 in fact several models of both 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.490
 companies offer support for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 go pro cameras so it will be 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.970
 interesting to see if the new strategy 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.920
 go pro business affects this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 aspect of the competition likewise 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.260
 We will have to see if the company that has 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.239
 shown super 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.220
 already in the development of cameras can 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.989
 repeat it in other areas because everything 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.299
 seems to indicate that he wants to become the 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.019
 absolute solution when speaking 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.730
 of photography and aerial video of the y 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.470
 announces its business plan 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.810
 daisy is a product that was born from a mod 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 of weapon but it became a phenomenon in itself 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.620
 same was released as a game 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 independent in steam early access a 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.819
 Late last year and became 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.739
 an absolute sales success but although 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.200
 it is perfectly functional and follows 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.849
 evolving let's say even after a 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.799
 year still did not have a date of 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.019
 definitive launch until this week 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.849
 when interactive bohemia announced its 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.129
 plans for what the game is coming 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.639
 will be definitely released mid 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.769
 of 2016 and between 2015 and that date the 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.060
 study will continue adding 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.560
 characteristics and polishing the product 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.150
 during the first months of the year that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.889
 new vehicles will arrive 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.319
 artificial intelligence for zombies 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.060
 and a basic stealth system before 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.400
 June a new user interface and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.010
 dynamic events later traps 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.290
 barricades and air transport and to order 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.430
 of year mates animals construction 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.829
 of bases and a beta version to 44 dollars 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.099
 In short, it will be launched in the middle of 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.079
 2016 at a value of 50 dollars and up 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.969
