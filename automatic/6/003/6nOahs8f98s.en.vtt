00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
not going to be any specific dates there

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750 
not going to be any specific dates there
usually<00:00:42.300> isn't<00:00:42.629> until<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.920> days<00:00:44.250> before

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it releases any specific date but they

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.940 
it releases any specific date but they
probably<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.140> don't<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> upset<00:00:49.590> anyone

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
probably just don't want to upset anyone

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.069 
probably just don't want to upset anyone
by<00:00:50.520> saying<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> date<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
by saying like a date and then I have it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.709 
by saying like a date and then I have it
coming<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.410> later<00:00:52.770> than<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.760> they'll

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
coming out later than that so they'll

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.180 
coming out later than that so they'll
definitely<00:00:54.870> hold<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> date<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
definitely hold off on the date for a
little<00:00:56.460> longer<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:58.020> we're

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
little longer here but what we're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.920 
little longer here but what we're
looking<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.590> update<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.980> buckets

looking at in this update is buckets
which<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> possibility<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.489> said<00:01:02.730> they've

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
which is a possibility they said they've

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
which is a possibility they said they've
had<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.329> trouble<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
had a lot of trouble with them but we

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
had a lot of trouble with them but we
can<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.810> creeping<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.080> us

they'll be hosted on this on a server on
a<00:01:22.500> computer<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> PC<00:01:25.350> servers<00:01:25.770> but

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
can see in you can change the different

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.220 
can see in you can change the different
graphics<00:02:22.189> not<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.909> fancy<00:02:23.389> or<00:02:23.599> medium<00:02:24.079> or

graphics not just a fancy or medium or

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.589 
graphics not just a fancy or medium or
low<00:02:24.379> now<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:25.219> can<00:02:25.489> actually<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:26.060> low

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
low now you can actually have low

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.069 
low now you can actually have low
graphics<00:02:27.139> with<00:02:27.319> fancy<00:02:27.799> fancy<00:02:28.760> skies<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.870> and

experiments the graphics which I'm not
too<00:02:34.340> sure<00:02:34.579> means<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.389> don't<00:02:35.420> know<00:02:35.659> anyone

too sure means and I don't know anyone
else<00:02:36.139> really<00:02:36.560> knows<00:02:36.769> what<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.010> means

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
else really knows what that means

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.580 
else really knows what that means
besides<00:02:37.489> of<00:02:37.819> developers<00:02:38.269> but<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.260> fancy

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
besides of developers but the fancy

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.839 
besides of developers but the fancy
graphics<00:02:40.040> you'll<00:02:40.189> be<00:02:40.280> able<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.489> turn<00:02:40.639> that<00:02:40.790> off

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
graphics you'll be able to turn that off

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.000 
graphics you'll be able to turn that off
and<00:02:41.000> still<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.930> skies<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.560> animated

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and still have the skies and animated

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520 
and still have the skies and animated
water<00:02:43.219> which<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.209> really<00:02:44.569> really<00:02:44.719> cool<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.499> I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
water which is really really cool so I

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.309 
water which is really really cool so I
can't<00:02:46.010> wait<00:02:46.219> for<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.629> again<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:47.780> input<00:02:47.959> menu

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
can't wait for that again the input menu

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.170 
can't wait for that again the input menu
I'm<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:48.739> really<00:02:48.919> too<00:02:49.040> sure<00:02:49.069> about<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.639> game<00:02:49.879> I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I'm not really too sure about the game I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.490 
I'm not really too sure about the game I
guess<00:02:50.419> your<00:02:50.599> Springs<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.019> back<00:02:51.169> into<00:02:51.379> your

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
guess your Springs you back into your

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.890 
guess your Springs you back into your
game<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.669> login<00:02:52.909> I<00:02:53.299> guess<00:02:53.449> you<00:02:53.599> can<00:02:53.719> log

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
game and the login I guess you can log

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.390 
game and the login I guess you can log
into<00:02:54.049> your<00:02:54.139> account<00:02:54.260> from<00:02:54.530> there<00:02:54.769> we're<00:02:55.280> not

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
into your account from there we're not

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.860 
into your account from there we're not
really<00:02:55.609> too<00:02:55.790> sure<00:02:55.819> about<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.449> that<00:02:56.689> was<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
really too sure about that that was just

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.699 
really too sure about that that was just
a<00:02:57.019> little<00:02:57.230> teaser<00:02:57.469> picture<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.230> think<00:03:00.379> it's

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
a little teaser picture so I think it's

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.899 
a little teaser picture so I think it's
gonna<00:03:00.829> be<00:03:01.010> very<00:03:01.189> interesting<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.639> things<00:03:01.819> to

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
gonna be very interesting and things to

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.629 
gonna be very interesting and things to
be<00:03:01.969> very<00:03:02.180> interesting<00:03:03.129> another<00:03:04.129> thing<00:03:04.370> that

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
be very interesting another thing that

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.069 
be very interesting another thing that
our<00:03:05.239> future<00:03:06.049> plans<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.219> are<00:03:07.459> maybe<00:03:08.079> possibly

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
our future plans that are maybe possibly

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.530 
our future plans that are maybe possibly
coming<00:03:09.409> in<00:03:09.500> 0.7<00:03:10.099> foot<00:03:10.219> off<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:10.579> are<00:03:10.669> not<00:03:10.849> too

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
coming in 0.7 foot off but are not too

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.369 
coming in 0.7 foot off but are not too
sure<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:12.139> camera<00:03:12.919> implementations<00:03:13.699> it<00:03:14.269> was<00:03:14.870> it

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
sure is camera implementations it was it

future plans they kind of backed off of

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.110 
future plans they kind of backed off of
it<00:03:23.419> and<00:03:23.769> what<00:03:24.769> this<00:03:24.889> is<00:03:25.069> kind<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.400> hopefully

for a long time and there's a small

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.569 
for a long time and there's a small
chance<00:03:40.819> we<00:03:41.030> can<00:03:41.120> expect<00:03:41.509> it<00:03:41.629> in<00:03:41.720> this<00:03:41.810> update

too<00:03:48.109> soon<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.769> future<00:03:49.099> it<00:03:49.639> can<00:03:49.849> sneak<00:03:50.150> up

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
too soon in the future it can sneak up

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.509 
too soon in the future it can sneak up
on<00:03:50.479> us<00:03:50.599> but<00:03:50.629> I<00:03:51.139> mean<00:03:51.680> with<00:03:51.979> it<00:03:52.129> with<00:03:52.340> the

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
on us but I mean with it with the

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.270 
on us but I mean with it with the
devices<00:03:52.849> running<00:03:53.629> now<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.439> it's<00:03:54.949> probably

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
devices running now it's it's probably

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.490 
devices running now it's it's probably
gonna<00:03:55.639> be<00:03:55.729> pretty<00:03:56.060> difficult<00:03:56.329> maybe<00:03:57.229> just

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
gonna be pretty difficult maybe just

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.959 
gonna be pretty difficult maybe just
bigger<00:03:57.709> world<00:03:57.979> to<00:03:58.159> see<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.489> future<00:03:58.790> I'm

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 
bigger world to see in the future I'm

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:00.819 
bigger world to see in the future I'm
not<00:03:59.030> sure<00:03:59.329> about<00:03:59.449> infinite<00:04:00.290> worlds<00:04:00.590> for<00:04:00.799> a

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
not sure about infinite worlds for a

not sure about infinite worlds for a
long<00:04:01.069> time<00:04:01.430> here<00:04:03.310> yes<00:04:04.310> next<00:04:05.180> on<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.540> list<00:04:05.659> we

long time here yes next on the list we

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.640 
long time here yes next on the list we
have<00:04:05.870> redstone<00:04:06.590> redstone<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:08.090> it's<00:04:08.989> been<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
have redstone redstone is it's been you

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.170 
have redstone redstone is it's been you
know<00:04:09.769> talked<00:04:10.099> about<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.370> long<00:04:10.549> time<00:04:10.789> the<00:04:11.000> ore

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
know talked about a long time the ore

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.209 
know talked about a long time the ore
has<00:04:11.209> been<00:04:11.389> in<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:12.349> game<00:04:12.560> since<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:13.039> very

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
has been in the game since the very

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.449 
has been in the game since the very
beginning<00:04:13.340> I<00:04:13.639> believe<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:15.459> there's

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
beginning I believe and there's

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.279 
beginning I believe and there's
different<00:04:16.880> like<00:04:17.030> redstone<00:04:17.539> power<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.169> you

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
different like redstone power that you

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.050 
different like redstone power that you
can<00:04:18.469> get<00:04:18.620> from<00:04:18.799> furnaces<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.549> sugarcane<00:04:19.820> and

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
can get from furnaces and sugarcane and

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.939 
can get from furnaces and sugarcane and
signs<00:04:20.509> and<00:04:20.719> all<00:04:20.780> these<00:04:20.870> tricks<00:04:21.259> but<00:04:21.500> no

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
signs and all these tricks but no

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.740 
signs and all these tricks but no
official<00:04:22.279> redstone<00:04:22.940> yet<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.510> we're<00:04:23.630> not

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
official redstone yet and we're not

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.190 
official redstone yet and we're not
gonna<00:04:23.930> see<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.740> don't<00:04:25.099> think<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.729> 0.74<00:04:26.539> now

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
gonna see that I don't think in 0.74 now

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.170 
gonna see that I don't think in 0.74 now
or<00:04:27.290> anything<00:04:28.070> kind<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.520> after<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:28.970> think

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
or anything kind of after that I think

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.020 
or anything kind of after that I think
we'll<00:04:29.300> see<00:04:29.420> that<00:04:29.600> later<00:04:29.660> on<00:04:30.490> once<00:04:31.490> we<00:04:31.580> get<00:04:31.820> you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
we'll see that later on once we get you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.460 
we'll see that later on once we get you
know<00:04:32.140> better<00:04:33.140> better<00:04:34.070> technology<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.090> better

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
know better better technology and better

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.910 
know better better technology and better
um<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.800> guess<00:04:37.640> just<00:04:37.670> lag<00:04:38.090> free<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:39.800> know

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
um I guess just lag free you know

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.430 
um I guess just lag free you know
techniques<00:04:40.670> with<00:04:40.970> this<00:04:41.150> game<00:04:41.660> creation<00:04:42.020> and

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
techniques with this game creation and

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.610 
techniques with this game creation and
the<00:04:43.430> sky<00:04:43.670> additions<00:04:44.150> not<00:04:45.080> only<00:04:45.290> do<00:04:45.380> we<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.560> a

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
the sky additions not only do we have a

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.890 
the sky additions not only do we have a
fancy<00:04:45.860> sky<00:04:46.220> now<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:46.730> we<00:04:47.180> are<00:04:47.300> looking<00:04:47.600> forward

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
fancy sky now but we are looking forward

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.380 
fancy sky now but we are looking forward
into<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.290> future<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.920> seeing<00:04:49.430> will<00:04:50.120> soon

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
into the future and seeing will soon

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.950 
into the future and seeing will soon
have<00:04:51.010> stars<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.640> suns<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.300> moons<00:04:53.390> and

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
have stars the suns and moons and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.800 
have stars the suns and moons and
sunrises<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.680> everything<00:04:55.250> like<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.810> to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
sunrises and everything like that to

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.930 
sunrises and everything like that to
kind<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.080> level<00:04:57.290> it<00:04:57.440> up<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> PC<00:04:58.190> version

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
kind of level it up to the PC version

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.450 
kind of level it up to the PC version
here<00:04:59.210> but<00:04:59.510> this<00:05:00.410> probably<00:05:00.800> will<00:05:00.920> not<00:05:01.070> come<00:05:01.340> in

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
here but this probably will not come in

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.460 
here but this probably will not come in
0.74<00:05:02.150> now<00:05:02.240> again<00:05:02.600> none<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.930> this<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.230> actually

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
0.74 now again none of this is actually

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.460 
0.74 now again none of this is actually
completely<00:05:04.190> 100<00:05:04.850> cent<00:05:05.020> written<00:05:06.020> in<00:05:06.110> stone<00:05:06.440> so

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
completely 100 cent written in stone so

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.890 
completely 100 cent written in stone so
this<00:05:06.890> could<00:05:07.040> all<00:05:07.130> change<00:05:07.510> but<00:05:08.510> this<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.810> just

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
this could all change but this is just

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.110 
this could all change but this is just
everything<00:05:09.170> we<00:05:09.350> know<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.470> far<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:10.190> it'll<00:05:10.880> seem

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
everything we know so far and it'll seem

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.530 
everything we know so far and it'll seem
that<00:05:11.360> we<00:05:11.930> may<00:05:12.170> get<00:05:12.380> these<00:05:12.530> Suns<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.420> maybe<00:05:14.420> a

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
that we may get these Suns and maybe a

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.720 
that we may get these Suns and maybe a
few<00:05:14.780> updates<00:05:14.930> after<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:15.800> few<00:05:16.190> minor<00:05:16.400> updates

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
few updates after a few minor updates

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.070 
few updates after a few minor updates
after<00:05:16.880> June<00:05:17.180> 4<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.420> 7<00:05:17.630> from<00:05:17.690> them

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
after June 4 and 7 from them

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.350 
after June 4 and 7 from them
or<00:05:18.410> sometime<00:05:18.920> heading<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.700> future<00:05:20.060> here

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.630 
also we're talking about customizable
skins<00:05:22.850> um<00:05:23.270> these<00:05:23.750> are<00:05:23.810> available<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:25.400> anyone

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
skins um these are available for anyone

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.490 
skins um these are available for anyone
really<00:05:25.910> but<00:05:26.330> you<00:05:26.750> won't<00:05:26.900> be<00:05:26.990> able<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.200> see<00:05:27.410> it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
really but you won't be able to see it

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.960 
really but you won't be able to see it
on<00:05:27.620> other<00:05:27.860> devices<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.640> think<00:05:28.820> through

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
on other devices and I think through

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.640 
on other devices and I think through
multiplayer<00:05:29.480> what<00:05:30.140> they're<00:05:30.260> trying<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.530> go

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
multiplayer what they're trying to go

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.290 
multiplayer what they're trying to go
for<00:05:30.860> is<00:05:30.950> being<00:05:31.160> able<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.550> have<00:05:31.760> customizable

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
for is being able to have customizable

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.050 
for is being able to have customizable
skins<00:05:32.900> which<00:05:33.560> will<00:05:33.740> most<00:05:33.860> likely<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.730> linked

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
skins which will most likely be linked

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.320 
skins which will most likely be linked
to<00:05:35.180> your<00:05:35.330> Mojang<00:05:35.900> account<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:37.150> right<00:05:38.150> now<00:05:38.270> you

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
to your Mojang account so right now you

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.870 
to your Mojang account so right now you
can<00:05:38.450> change<00:05:38.780> your<00:05:38.900> skin<00:05:39.080> anyone<00:05:39.440> can<00:05:39.730> but<00:05:40.730> it's

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
can change your skin anyone can but it's

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.610 
can change your skin anyone can but it's
not<00:05:40.970> invisible<00:05:41.630> by<00:05:41.750> other<00:05:41.930> players<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.590> I

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
not invisible by other players and I

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.780 
not invisible by other players and I
think<00:05:42.860> that's<00:05:43.010> what<00:05:43.130> they're<00:05:43.220> going<00:05:43.400> for<00:05:43.520> with

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
think that's what they're going for with

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.450 
think that's what they're going for with
this<00:05:43.880> customizable<00:05:44.420> skins<00:05:45.100> and<00:05:46.100> a<00:05:46.280> lot<00:05:46.430> of

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
this customizable skins and a lot of

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.340 
this customizable skins and a lot of
people<00:05:46.760> want<00:05:46.940> caves<00:05:47.300> now<00:05:47.660> to<00:05:47.720> talk<00:05:48.320> about

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
people want caves now to talk about

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.040 
people want caves now to talk about
caves<00:05:48.830> it's<00:05:49.640> really<00:05:50.000> vague<00:05:50.330> right<00:05:50.630> now<00:05:50.810> they

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
caves it's really vague right now they

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.170 
caves it's really vague right now they
may<00:05:51.260> have<00:05:51.290> an<00:05:51.620> option<00:05:52.100> for<00:05:52.340> it<00:05:52.400> for<00:05:53.000> better

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
may have an option for it for better

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.460 
may have an option for it for better
devices<00:05:53.540> a<00:05:53.720> toggleable<00:05:54.200> option<00:05:55.570> so<00:05:56.570> that's

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
devices a toggleable option so that's

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.290 
devices a toggleable option so that's
kind<00:05:57.950> of<00:05:57.980> what<00:05:58.100> they<00:05:58.190> stated<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:58.730> I<00:05:58.760> think<00:05:58.970> Jeb

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
kind of what they stated and I think Jeb

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.750 
kind of what they stated and I think Jeb
stated<00:05:59.660> that<00:05:59.810> and<00:06:00.130> that<00:06:01.130> will<00:06:01.250> be<00:06:01.340> coming<00:06:01.580> in

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
stated that and that will be coming in

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.610 
stated that and that will be coming in
later<00:06:02.000> updates<00:06:02.450> hopefully<00:06:03.080> again<00:06:03.320> none<00:06:03.530> of

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
later updates hopefully again none of

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.580 
later updates hopefully again none of
this<00:06:03.680> is<00:06:03.830> confirmed<00:06:04.310> also<00:06:05.000> Johan<00:06:05.930> mentioned

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
this is confirmed also Johan mentioned

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.650 
this is confirmed also Johan mentioned
in<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.010> issue<00:06:07.130> tracker<00:06:07.430> which<00:06:08.330> is<00:06:08.450> very

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
in the issue tracker which is very

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.750 
in the issue tracker which is very
interesting<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:09.380> nether<00:06:09.650> reactor<00:06:10.520> may<00:06:10.700> be

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
interesting the nether reactor may be

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.820 
interesting the nether reactor may be
replaced<00:06:11.120> in<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.450> future<00:06:11.750> meaning<00:06:12.050> they<00:06:12.680> may

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
replaced in the future meaning they may

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.260 
replaced in the future meaning they may
have<00:06:13.010> another<00:06:13.190> dimension<00:06:13.670> in<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:13.820> future<00:06:14.090> or

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
have another dimension in the future or

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.360 
have another dimension in the future or
another<00:06:14.540> technique<00:06:15.050> in<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.410> future<00:06:15.830> this<00:06:16.310> is

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
another technique in the future this is

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.490 
another technique in the future this is
you<00:06:16.700> know<00:06:16.820> probably<00:06:17.450> looking<00:06:17.720> on<00:06:17.870> pretty<00:06:18.230> far

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
you know probably looking on pretty far

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.860 
you know probably looking on pretty far
ahead<00:06:18.590> but<00:06:19.400> that's<00:06:19.670> some<00:06:19.820> pretty<00:06:20.000> interesting

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
ahead but that's some pretty interesting

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.870 
ahead but that's some pretty interesting
information<00:06:21.560> because<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:22.220> nether<00:06:22.430> actors

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
information because the nether actors

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.000 
information because the nether actors
you<00:06:23.630> know<00:06:23.660> some<00:06:24.050> people<00:06:24.320> like<00:06:24.470> it<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:24.680> lot<00:06:24.890> of

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
you know some people like it a lot of

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.070 
you know some people like it a lot of
people<00:06:25.220> don't<00:06:25.430> like<00:06:25.640> it<00:06:25.700> I'm<00:06:26.510> kind<00:06:26.750> of<00:06:26.870> on<00:06:26.990> the

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
people don't like it I'm kind of on the

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.660 
people don't like it I'm kind of on the
fence<00:06:27.230> about<00:06:27.470> it<00:06:27.620> because<00:06:27.890> it<00:06:28.040> is<00:06:28.070> pretty<00:06:28.340> cost

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
fence about it because it is pretty cost

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.270 
fence about it because it is pretty cost
effective<00:06:29.240> but<00:06:29.480> with<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.230> new<00:06:30.440> production

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
effective but with the new production

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.620 
effective but with the new production
that<00:06:31.550> it<00:06:31.640> kind<00:06:31.850> of<00:06:31.910> gives<00:06:32.120> I<00:06:32.270> think<00:06:32.510> it's

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
that it kind of gives I think it's

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.210 
that it kind of gives I think it's
pretty<00:06:32.840> good<00:06:33.170> but<00:06:34.010> um<00:06:34.750> yeah<00:06:35.750> so<00:06:36.170> that<00:06:37.040> is

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
pretty good but um yeah so that is

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.580 
pretty good but um yeah so that is
pretty<00:06:37.430> much<00:06:37.670> all<00:06:37.940> for<00:06:38.000> this<00:06:38.360> update<00:06:38.540> it's<00:06:39.350> not
