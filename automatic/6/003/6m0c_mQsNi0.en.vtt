00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.076
 My name is Frodan, I'm a commentator here at BlizzCon 

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.002
 and the finale was fabulous. 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.366
 I really supported Firebat as a local hero 

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.123
 and I could not dream of a better scenario. 

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.997
 Yes absolutely, I think everyone came with their own style 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.205
 we saw Chinese bringing their own decks thinking they would work 

00:02:57.325 --> 00:02:59.674
 but sometimes it does not work in the West 

00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:01.318
 and that surprises some people. 

00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:03.752
 But even in these decks 

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:05.357
 we have seen some interesting choices. 

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.348
 Like Firebat who brought his own Miracle Rogue Pirate 

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:10.005
 It was really cool to see. 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.348
 Goblins and Gnomes will do wonders for the stage 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.153
 because more cards mean more strategies 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:16.307
 and more things you can do. 

00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:18.724
 And one of the components of a card game is 

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.228
 know what to do with your resources 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.074
 and be able to build your own deck. 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.178
 This is the most fun aspect of Hearthstone for me 

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:25.937
 and for millions of other players 

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:28.842
 so I think it will have a big impact on the competitive stage 

00:03:28.864 --> 00:03:30.526
 and its evolution in the future. 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.913
 My name is Ben Brode I'm so excited to be here 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.368
 we have just experienced the Hearthstone finale 

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.090
 Firebat has torn everything! 

00:03:37.118 --> 00:03:38.507
 It was such an incredible event 

00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:40.386
 I am so excited to be here 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.421
 it's incredible !
