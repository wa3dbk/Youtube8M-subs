you know you can never know what to
expect<00:02:00.520> until<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.210> actually<00:02:01.329> get<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.929> you

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
expect until you actually get to it you

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.270 
expect until you actually get to it you
can<00:02:02.829> have<00:02:02.979> expectations<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:05.170> don't<00:02:06.009> always

can have expectations but don't always

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:32.830 
can have expectations but don't always
guarantee<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.880> gonna<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:07.840> way
