00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.590
 and more 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.590
 ah 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.629
 welcome to our channel 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.730
 of techno gaming as always 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.009
 we bring the latest news in this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.619
 video we analyze a pretty product 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.970
 particular and innovative is about the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 sd memory the company toshiba 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.520
 surely they are wondering what 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.860
 has this memory different with the 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.410
 rest by continuous the wireless chip 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.420
 that allows you to share all your photos 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.910
 directly from your camera 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.780
 Here we find a guide and its manual 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.339
 guarantee that is 5 years nothing else no 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.739
 this memory has a capacity 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.949
 total of 8 gigabytes enough to 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.960
 take photos and videos in high resolution 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.239
 It also weighs approximately 2 grams and 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.390
 Supports the standards of the wireless 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.320
 wgn as well as the web security 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.630
 it is wpa2 among others 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.740
 now we proceed to install the software 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.570
 of toshiba has called a flash but 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.700
 This software allows us to configure 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.820
 a simple and very practical way to 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.979
 device on its first screen what 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.740
 What stands out most is the configuration of 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.650
 wireless mode 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.470
 this is to configure the name of the network and 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.270
 your password which we should know 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.270
 very good to be able to access then 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.899
 the software also has another function 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.820
 of grounding the device to zero 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.890
 It would also be prudent to have a 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.340
 backup in case of any occurrence 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.409
 inconvenience or everything was erased and good 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.840
 I told them a backup 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.539
 came the moment of truth we inserted 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.700
 memory is the trailer of our 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.469
 photo camera in a simple way 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.619
 as we would with any other 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.929
 sd memory we start the camera to 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.780
 directly access the menu that we 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:09.100
 indicates the status of the wireless chip in 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.050
 this case is very operative 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.180
 remember that the wireless function 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.130
 it only connects when necessary 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.180
 maintaining energy consumption 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.180
 pretty low 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.590
 with the detection of the wireless network 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.330
 we can access the sd flash memory 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.020
 in this case we use the browser 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.099
 google chrome we put fraser so that 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.050
 direct us directly to the folders 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.000
 we can select or see directly 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.110
 of the browser the photos that we have taken 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.120
 recently here we have the photos and 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.349
 we can even see them in all their 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.349
 splendor from the browser 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.500
