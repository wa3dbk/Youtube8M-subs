Creek about eight years ago and I could

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.740 
Creek about eight years ago and I could
see<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> snakes<00:00:55.430> basking<00:00:56.120> out<00:00:56.239> on<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.510> walks

during<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.470> day<00:00:57.619> and<00:00:58.070> I've<00:00:58.250> got<00:00:58.430> those

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
during the day and I've got those

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.439 
during the day and I've got those
branches<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.760> that's<00:01:01.760> why<00:01:01.909> I<00:01:01.940> came<00:01:02.150> down<00:01:02.420> here

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
branches so that's why I came down here

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.509 
branches so that's why I came down here
and<00:01:02.900> you<00:01:03.080> saw<00:01:03.290> me<00:01:03.470> my<00:01:03.619> first<00:01:03.799> trout

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
and you saw me my first trout

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.580 
and you saw me my first trout
so<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.970> were<00:01:05.089> concerned<00:01:05.290> mostly<00:01:06.290> about

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
so you were concerned mostly about

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.649 
so you were concerned mostly about
having<00:01:06.860> poisonous<00:01:07.340> snakes<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> air<00:01:08.390> I'm

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
having poisonous snakes in the air I'm

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.149 
having poisonous snakes in the air I'm
not<00:01:08.810> smart<00:01:09.110> enough<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.350> know<00:01:09.530> once<00:01:09.770> make<00:01:10.010> them

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
not smart enough to know once make them

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.230 
not smart enough to know once make them
another<00:01:10.400> okay<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:12.700> you're<00:01:13.700> telling<00:01:14.030> me<00:01:14.060> that

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
another okay and you're telling me that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.480 
another okay and you're telling me that
you<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:15.200> hadn't<00:01:15.500> had<00:01:15.650> any<00:01:15.890> traps<00:01:16.250> out

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
you just you hadn't had any traps out

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.480 
you just you hadn't had any traps out
for<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.729> while<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:17.510> quit

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
for a while and you just quit

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.530 
for a while and you just quit
just<00:01:20.060> last<00:01:20.299> night<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.130> three<00:01:22.579> in<00:01:23.360> that

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
just last night so three in that

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.139 
just last night so three in that
situation<00:01:24.290> which<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.220> consider<00:01:25.610> an<00:01:25.700> ideal<00:01:25.790> when

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
situation which I consider an ideal when

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.240 
situation which I consider an ideal when
you<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.329> flowing<00:01:26.750> water<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.740> probably<00:01:28.189> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
you have flowing water it's probably the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.880 
you have flowing water it's probably the
most<00:01:28.460> ideal<00:01:29.360> situation<00:01:29.630> for<00:01:30.080> trapping<00:01:30.619> snakes

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
most ideal situation for trapping snakes

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.010 
most ideal situation for trapping snakes
did<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.159> put<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:31.460> thing<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:32.000> with<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.840> mouth

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
did you put this thing in with the mouth

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.889 
did you put this thing in with the mouth
of<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.350> trap<00:01:33.560> facing<00:01:34.039> up<00:01:34.189> Creek<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:35.270> couple<00:01:35.840> of

of the trap facing up Creek a couple of
rocks<00:01:36.110> around<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.399> will<00:01:37.580> catch<00:01:37.789> snake

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
rocks around it you will catch snake

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.600 
rocks around it you will catch snake
after<00:01:38.539> snake<00:01:38.929> after<00:01:39.140> snake<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.220> were<00:01:40.310> telling

I<00:01:58.729> never<00:01:59.000> thought<00:01:59.299> these<00:01:59.450> things<00:01:59.690> would<00:01:59.899> work

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
I never thought these things would work
