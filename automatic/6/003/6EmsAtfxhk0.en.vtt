emergency brake let's get a hook over
that<00:01:08.640> pivot<00:01:09.000> point<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> sit

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that pivot point and it's going to sit

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
that pivot point and it's going to sit
right<00:01:11.420> inside<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.450> groove<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:14.670> spring<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
right inside that groove the spring is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.530 
right inside that groove the spring is
going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.600> hook<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.939> other<00:01:17.970> side<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
going to hook in here the other side of

going to hook in here the other side of
this<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> hook<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.890> here

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
this is going to hook right in here

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
this is going to hook right in here
right<00:01:21.509> next<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.290> spring<00:01:22.830> head<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
right next to that other spring head you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
right next to that other spring head you
see<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.909> bite<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.600> with

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
see in there so bite down on this with

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.399 
see in there so bite down on this with
some<00:01:28.439> needle<00:01:28.740> moves<00:01:32.000> meanwhile<00:01:33.000> you're

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
some needle moves meanwhile you're

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.039 
some needle moves meanwhile you're
making<00:01:34.409> sure<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.799> doesn't<00:01:35.100> fall<00:01:35.460> off<00:01:36.049> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
making sure this doesn't fall off this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.980 
making sure this doesn't fall off this
part<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:37.740> tricky<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.520> part

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
part can be a little tricky this part

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
part can be a little tricky this part
the<00:01:42.990> spring<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> definitely<00:01:43.680> heavy

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the spring is definitely heavy

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.570 
the spring is definitely heavy
maybe<00:01:45.930> it'll<00:01:46.080> be<00:01:46.230> easier<00:01:46.650> again<00:01:46.980> to<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.400> this

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
maybe it'll be easier again to do this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:58.070 
maybe it'll be easier again to do this
this<00:01:47.790> way<00:01:51.890> put<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.130> side<00:01:54.830> over<00:01:55.830> here<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:57.080> do

this way put this side over here I do

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:22.690 
this way put this side over here I do
have<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.350> spring<00:01:58.650> pool<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.130> maybe<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.490> use<00:01:59.820> it

because the only way to undo it is to

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.630 
because the only way to undo it is to
take<00:05:26.250> this

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.970 

apart<00:05:29.640> after<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.750> put<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.590> all<00:05:31.680> back<00:05:31.830> together

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
get it to a point like that where it

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.050 
get it to a point like that where it
just<00:05:37.950> drags<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.580> bit<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.980> then<00:05:41.060> when

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
just drags a little bit and then when

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.060 
just drags a little bit and then when
you<00:05:42.180> put<00:05:42.360> your<00:05:42.480> card<00:05:42.750> your<00:05:43.080> wheel<00:05:43.290> back<00:05:43.500> on<00:05:43.560> and

you put your card your wheel back on and
you<00:05:44.880> drive<00:05:45.240> your<00:05:45.450> car<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:47.460> reverse<00:05:48.020> back<00:05:49.020> it

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
you drive your car and reverse back it

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.080 
you drive your car and reverse back it
up<00:05:49.320> down<00:05:49.620> the<00:05:49.800> road<00:05:49.980> and<00:05:50.310> pump<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.790> brakes

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
up down the road and pump the brakes

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.320 
up down the road and pump the brakes
that<00:05:51.390> star<00:05:52.110> wheel<00:05:52.410> will<00:05:53.040> adjust<00:05:53.430> itself<00:05:53.940> to

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
that star wheel will adjust itself to

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.090 
that star wheel will adjust itself to
push<00:05:54.570> your<00:05:54.750> brake<00:05:54.990> pads<00:05:55.200> out<00:05:55.530> to<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.920> right

push your brake pads out to the right

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.220 
push your brake pads out to the right
tolerance<00:05:56.700> so<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.150> it<00:05:57.270> creates<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.900> right

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
tolerance so that it creates the right

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.920 
tolerance so that it creates the right
amount<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:58.650> drag<00:05:58.890> on<00:05:59.190> your<00:05:59.340> brake<00:05:59.970> drum<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:00.870> you

amount of drag on your brake drum so you

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.600 
amount of drag on your brake drum so you
don't<00:06:01.140> have<00:06:01.260> to<00:06:01.350> go<00:06:01.440> crazy<00:06:01.620> with<00:06:01.920> that<00:06:02.100> thing<00:06:02.340> I
