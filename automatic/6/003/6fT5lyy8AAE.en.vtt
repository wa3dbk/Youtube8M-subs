surgery done on Thursday today is Sunday
the<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.809> day<00:00:48.930> afterwards<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.070> actually<00:00:50.280> had

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the first day afterwards I actually had

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.729 
the first day afterwards I actually had
pretty<00:00:51.780> bad<00:00:51.989> case<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> double<00:00:52.710> vision

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
pretty bad case of double vision

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.350 
pretty bad case of double vision
actually<00:00:53.100> considering<00:00:53.789> I've<00:00:53.850> never<00:00:54.059> had<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
actually considering I've never had it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
actually considering I've never had it
before<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.590> sure<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.160> bad<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.640> was

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
before so I'm not sure how bad it was

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.959 
before so I'm not sure how bad it was
but<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> difficult<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.969> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
but it was kind of difficult to to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.700 
but it was kind of difficult to to
comprehend<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> first<00:01:01.379> time

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
comprehend because for the first time

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189 
comprehend because for the first time
ever<00:01:02.100> both<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.670> my<00:01:02.789> eyes<00:01:02.969> were<00:01:03.300> tracking<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ever both of my eyes were tracking and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.520 
ever both of my eyes were tracking and
relying<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.729> same<00:01:06.000> image<00:01:06.420> twice<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.200> think

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
relying the same image twice and I think

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.550 
relying the same image twice and I think
my<00:01:07.650> brain<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.130> having<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> tough<00:01:08.700> time

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
my brain was having a tough time

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.850 
my brain was having a tough time
interpreting<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.979> signals<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.990> every

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
interpreting those signals so as every

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
interpreting those signals so as every
day<00:01:14.010> went<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.760> today's<00:01:15.030> weird<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> fourth

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
day went by and today's weird the fourth

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
day went by and today's weird the fourth
day<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.080> feeling<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.950> better

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
day I'm actually feeling much better

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
day I'm actually feeling much better
although<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.990> say<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.409> while<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
although I can I can say that while I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
although I can I can say that while I
could<00:01:19.979> focus<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.549> better<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.390> can't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
could focus a lot better now I can't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.160 
could focus a lot better now I can't
really<00:01:22.530> focus<00:01:22.890> enough<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.610> read<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
really focus enough to read from a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
really focus enough to read from a
distance<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.979> I'm<00:01:26.310> hoping<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.700> improves<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
distance and I'm hoping that improves as

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.649 
distance and I'm hoping that improves as
time<00:01:27.720> goes<00:01:27.930> by<00:01:28.130> also<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.490> noticed<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.540> eyes

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
time goes by also I noticed that my eyes

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.010 
time goes by also I noticed that my eyes
are<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:31.259> dilated<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.310> swollen<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.900> I've

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
are really dilated and swollen so I've

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.350 
are really dilated and swollen so I've
been<00:01:34.140> putting<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.710> those<00:01:34.979> ice<00:01:35.280> packs<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> like

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
been putting on those ice packs and like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.850 
been putting on those ice packs and like
the<00:01:36.479> cucumber<00:01:36.720> things<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.650> reduce

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the cucumber things to really reduce

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.640 
the cucumber things to really reduce
swelling<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.549> eyes<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.380> makes

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
swelling in my eyes this actually makes

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.990 
swelling in my eyes this actually makes
me<00:01:40.829> feel<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.250> better<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.790> been
