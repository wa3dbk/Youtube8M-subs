just stands around just sounds like that

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.830 
just stands around just sounds like that
so<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.660> ok<00:03:42.930> then<00:03:43.799> we<00:03:43.950> do<00:03:44.130> ratchet<00:03:47.810> oath<00:03:48.810> very

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
so it's ok then we do ratchet oath very

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.629 
so it's ok then we do ratchet oath very
well<00:03:51.079> perhaps<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.769> most<00:03:52.980> believable

on either side of the neither arm on
either<00:04:25.690> panel<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.230> guess<00:04:26.610> so

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
either panel I guess so

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.670 
either panel I guess so
and<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.389> funny<00:04:28.660> looking<00:04:29.020> goofy<00:04:29.260> looking

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
ratchet but it is ratchet so keep them

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.080 
ratchet but it is ratchet so keep them
there<00:04:37.110> finally<00:04:38.110> perhaps<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.770> best<00:04:39.010> toy<00:04:39.730> or

best figure in the entire lot is
bumblebee<00:04:43.419> I<00:04:43.870> say<00:04:44.440> this<00:04:44.590> because<00:04:44.830> this<00:04:45.100> is

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
bumblebee I say this because this is

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.520 
bumblebee I say this because this is

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
head fold out the and the feet and this

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.219 
head fold out the and the feet and this
is<00:05:23.979> what<00:05:24.160> that's<00:05:24.850> interesting<00:05:25.419> he's<00:05:26.080> got

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
is what that's interesting he's got

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.640 
is what that's interesting he's got
waist<00:05:26.650> articulation<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.810> really<00:05:29.200> if<00:05:29.440> this

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
waist articulation so really if this

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.670 
waist articulation so really if this
think<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:29.979> passes<00:05:30.340> g1<00:05:31.050> figure<00:05:32.050> in<00:05:32.140> my<00:05:32.290> opinion

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
think it passes g1 figure in my opinion

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.500 
think it passes g1 figure in my opinion
the<00:05:33.220> arms<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.880> head<00:05:33.970> are<00:05:34.150> made<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.479> a

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
the arms and the head are made of a

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.719 
the arms and the head are made of a
softer<00:05:35.760> material<00:05:36.760> of<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.419> body<00:05:37.660> and<00:05:38.550> he's<00:05:39.550> got

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
softer material of the body and he's got

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.040 
softer material of the body and he's got
poseable<00:05:40.300> arms<00:05:40.720> it's<00:05:40.900> just<00:05:41.110> like<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.320> g1<00:05:41.710> figure

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
poseable arms it's just like a g1 figure

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.890 
poseable arms it's just like a g1 figure
very<00:05:44.050> nice<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.680> guess<00:05:44.919> ratchet<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.610> and

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
very nice I guess ratchet and and

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.909 
very nice I guess ratchet and and
bumblebee<00:05:46.900> could<00:05:47.110> pass<00:05:47.289> this<00:05:47.440> G<00:05:47.650> 1<00:05:47.740> but

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
bumblebee could pass this G 1 but

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.860 
bumblebee could pass this G 1 but
ratchet<00:05:48.460> has<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.580> false<00:05:48.930> chest<00:05:50.520> which<00:05:51.520> is<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
ratchet has a false chest which is the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.900 
ratchet has a false chest which is the
cheating<00:05:52.870> in<00:05:53.050> my<00:05:53.169> opinion<00:05:53.590> but<00:05:54.430> but<00:05:54.640> I<00:05:54.729> guess

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
cheating in my opinion but but I guess

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.029 
cheating in my opinion but but I guess
this<00:05:55.090> one<00:05:55.270> is<00:05:55.300> probably<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:55.900> best<00:05:56.140> I<00:05:56.470> guess<00:05:56.830> as

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
this one is probably the best I guess as

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.909 
this one is probably the best I guess as
I<00:05:57.160> said<00:05:57.900> could've<00:05:58.900> painted<00:05:59.050> this<00:05:59.289> one<00:05:59.440> red<00:05:59.680> but

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
I said could've painted this one red but

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.500 
I said could've painted this one red but
didn't<00:06:00.400> he's<00:06:00.580> got<00:06:00.760> an<00:06:00.850> Autobot<00:06:01.180> symbol

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
didn't he's got an Autobot symbol

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.540 
didn't he's got an Autobot symbol
embossed<00:06:01.870> on<00:06:02.260> the<00:06:02.919> chest<00:06:03.310> so<00:06:04.440> there<00:06:05.440> bumblebee

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
embossed on the chest so there bumblebee

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.370
