00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
best to deal with because it obviously
switches<00:02:05.850> faster<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:07.290> harder<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> do

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
switches faster and it's harder to do

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.260 
switches faster and it's harder to do
without<00:02:08.069> fast<00:02:08.340> hand<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.849> you're<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.149> gonna

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
without fast hand but you're just gonna

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.650 
without fast hand but you're just gonna
want

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
want

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.170 
want
that's<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.290> prefer<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.130> it'll<00:02:11.820> take<00:02:11.850> longer

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that's in I prefer it it'll take longer

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.120 
that's in I prefer it it'll take longer
but<00:02:12.630> um<00:02:12.810> basically<00:02:13.140> i<00:02:13.290> found<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> shot<00:02:13.830> by
