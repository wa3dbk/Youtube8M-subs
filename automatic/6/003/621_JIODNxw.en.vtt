can<00:02:20.840> lay<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.320> high<00:02:21.470> reach<00:02:21.709> demolition<00:02:22.280> rig

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
can lay the high reach demolition rig

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.479 
can lay the high reach demolition rig
aside<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.930> cradle<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.500> pick<00:02:25.129> up<00:02:25.280> an

alternative rig for doing low-level work

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.460 
alternative rig for doing low-level work
so<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.640> machine<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:28.970> never<00:02:29.360> standing<00:02:30.140> idle

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
so the machine is never standing idle

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.860 
so the machine is never standing idle
once<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.580> high<00:02:31.730> reach<00:02:31.910> demolition<00:02:32.420> work<00:02:32.570> has

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
once the high reach demolition work has

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.330 
once the high reach demolition work has
