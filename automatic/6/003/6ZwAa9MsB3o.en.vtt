everything<00:03:15.820> video

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.730 

oh<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.820> just<00:03:27.600> weird<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:28.110> there's<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.380> curtain

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
oh and just weird as there's a curtain

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.830 
oh and just weird as there's a curtain
here<00:03:28.980> lower<00:03:29.760> half<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.330> can't<00:03:30.570> see<00:03:30.690> their

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
here lower half you can't see their

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.020 
here lower half you can't see their
faces<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.470> just<00:03:31.920> curtain<00:03:32.340> things<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> way

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
faces and just curtain things in the way

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.570 
faces and just curtain things in the way
and<00:03:33.900> once<00:03:34.830> again<00:03:34.950> when<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> see<00:03:35.430> people

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
and once again when you see people

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.250 
and once again when you see people
eating<00:03:35.730> across<00:03:36.150> from<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.450> can't<00:03:36.960> see<00:03:37.140> their

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
eating across from you can't see their

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.460 
eating across from you can't see their
faces<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.700> guess<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.480> way<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.140> keep

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
faces so I guess it's a way to keep

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.270 
faces so I guess it's a way to keep
everyone<00:03:40.850> private<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.450> as<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.600> can<00:03:42.720> see

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.650 

really<00:04:14.560> good<00:04:15.660> I'm<00:04:16.660> finished<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.940> was<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.360> good

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
really good I'm finished it was so good

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.560

I<00:04:19.720> ate<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.080> all<00:04:20.670> it<00:04:21.670> wasn't<00:04:21.850> a<00:04:21.880> spicier<00:04:22.360> than<00:04:22.480> I

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
I ate it all it wasn't a spicier than I

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.790 
I ate it all it wasn't a spicier than I
thought<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.780> would<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.200> it's<00:04:23.350> really<00:04:23.530> good

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
thought it would be but it's really good

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.010 
thought it would be but it's really good
and<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.580> know<00:04:24.640> ramen<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.180> not<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.480> healthiest

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and I know ramen is not the healthiest

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and I know ramen is not the healthiest
food<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.710> Japan<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:27.310> compared<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.120> mcdonalds

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
food in Japan but compared to mcdonalds

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.170 
food in Japan but compared to mcdonalds
this<00:04:30.040> was<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> little<00:04:30.610> bit<00:04:30.730> healthier<00:04:30.910> than

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
this was a little bit healthier than

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.450 
this was a little bit healthier than
McDonald's<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.690> think<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.110> just<00:04:32.950> as<00:04:33.130> filling

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
McDonald's I think and just as filling

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.760 
McDonald's I think and just as filling
it's<00:04:33.610> not<00:04:33.790> more<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.240> definitely<00:04:34.990> recommend<00:04:35.260> eat
