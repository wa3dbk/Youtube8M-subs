00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.500
 Hello, this is the first watch 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:25.789
 camp stopwatch 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.789
 don't show correctly 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.870
 a photo 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:46.650
 the stopwatch does not work and that's where the glue 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:51.570
 dirty on the body the camera will show bad 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.420
 here scratches are generally not hours but 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.430
 golem washed which is not worth it and 20 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.080
 kopecks 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:05.190
 old watches i ordered from this 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:07.250
 the seller is also identical to them 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.250
 situation 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:32.870
 not working arrow shows not exactly 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:34.850
 the second problem is here is not here 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.560
 such a bolt strengthener that is it 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.560
 she does not hold over time 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.630
 falls off 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.260
 so here it falls 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:03.229
 and does not hold so Halim and video need 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:07.009
 will overwrite so and here's another one 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:15.200
 watches on which the same thing with 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:18.850
 stop hop and it shows but inaccurately 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.850
 this watch is basically ok
