00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello today there is my passion 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.990
 favorites and we start with the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.139
 It's thank God in july 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.330
 finally got warm and I have 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 that's why I really love it very much 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.420
 I wear simple outfits 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.330
 actually always and mine 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.590
 beloved blouses with two front pockets 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.680
 turn on and just usually print 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 because it's just nice and airy and me 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 I have different blouses 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.349
 most of them are a bit like that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 thinner from the fabric or even a bit 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.100
 transparent and that is just where 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.020
 it is a bit warmer as well as beautiful 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.969
 because you were not ten yet 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 drunter is supposed to just like that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 can wear and my newest 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 Achievement is more accurate from h &amp; m 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.539
 be from the trent departments which sees 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.480
 that's how you think I see it 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 Can I just stop my hand in the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.579
 blouse can be seen very well that is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 very nice 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.520
 which is totally silky fabric from the bit 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 transparent has in itself such a 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.030
 forest green darker color so on 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 a little blue in there which I still have 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 not in my wardrobe 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 As I said two bags full of it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 here too this military inspired 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.920
 But let's not about the further 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.310
 attract attention and long sleeve but I 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.909
 actually as her crumpler as on the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.860
 sleeve 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.650
 and that's not too long too 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.960
 short is so easy on npo behind 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 front is a bit shorter I think 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.799
 very perfect because you can do it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 Wear it with a pair of trousers but you can 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.130
 even if you like the poles hide 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.710
 want a leggings or whatever 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.229
 wear the look does not look out there if you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.540
 I would like to cover them up 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.790
 I like to have them relatively up to date 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.729
 and I have worn this 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.040
 leather skirt I have my love back 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.420
 found in korea and then got up 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
 the search made because I have this 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.000
 basic skirts worn by skin after 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.770
 a stronger variant from 1 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.090
 well fake leather skirt found me 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.950
 but somehow not really good 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.360
 has been sitting and since then I'm here 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.960
 I also have a video 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.329
 shown 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.940
 that's from nick clegg you have to 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.220
 I also wear it today 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.410
 really no one else because he 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.660
 somehow right length has for mine 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.580
 size and he also has two front pockets 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.349
 What I like very much is that one 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.000
 Gummizug means that you can in the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.400
 waist or in the hip 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.709
 he is very very fat that is 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.540
 I have it incredible even in winter 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.370
 he likes to wear it but he is also in summer 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.440
 now a little too fat but also too 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.549
 not too thin that you can see anything 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.380
 what you should not see 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.390
 So I am very satisfied and me 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.580
 I also like the combination in total 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.830
 worn in the evening to go away with 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.810
 higher shoes or during the day 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.000
 easy with ballerinas and a bit 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.829
 worn more casual I like the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.299
 I can relate to both films 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.519
 I do not really remember that 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.420
 just know that we have seen lincoln 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.709
 and I was very tired she is I believe 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.110
 partly solved a bit away 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.600
 at least not really asleep 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.400
 but as he still speaks to me in English 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.980
 looked and I found it partly very 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.290
 hard to listen to the language of course 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.340
 also a little older is yes 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.959
 but at the time then 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.220
 not the shocker somehow me 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.260
 he thinks he has some oscars 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.420
 so the actors were 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.209
 all great and it was mega star 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.090
 occupation but so of the stories is yes 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.319
 still not somehow 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.000
 geographic documentary but 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.420
 actually a Hollywood movie, therefore 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.920
 I have a little more story more 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.269
 action if you can say that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.370
 expected and was there a bit 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.799
 disappointed I was not disappointed 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.239
 from this jam and that is 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.079
 a homemade jam the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.880
 I intend to 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.709
 I think the year before that time 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.160
 and I love you about everything and everything 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.510
 I am so glad to have her again 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.340
 within two days again 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.069
 the half out and that is 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.099
 homemade jam 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.900
 espresso and chocolate that 's about 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.159
 the tastiest chocolate epr and me 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.349
 I have to give the recipe someday 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.450
 leave so I make myself once 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.389
 Maybe then I can also video 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.889
 But this is what I do about it 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.599
 really have nothing else in the morning 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.310
 eaten as dark bread and this 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.259
 Jam on it and that's really it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.639
 best and this also totally me and 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.190
 we continue with delicious things 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.099
 and I have my own 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.710
 favorite book snack / lunch 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.949
 made or just eat like that and 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.169
 Although bohli came and that would like here 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.889
 I do not stick to it anymore 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.410
 rhein ruhr karola with spelled wholegrain bread 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:41.340
 I do the burka mole with normal 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:45.080
 with a little bit salt of yogurt 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.630
 sometimes Munich has tomatoes garlic 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.669
 freshly squeezed lemon juice yummy 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.110
 There is nothing better and either open 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.849
 smeared bread or I do that now 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.880
 in this case, I also like very much 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.820
 like the tortilla chips without anything though 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.220
 There is nothing else in salt but what 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.310
 I do not think it's these 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.990
 skis or paprika or whatever 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.639
 yes, I have formal too 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.830
 endowed boss to do it yourself if you 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.070
 a good recipe knows because somehow 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.930
 The recipes are always ready 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.970
 wheat totti as and shoves it in oven 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.400
 and that is not healthy for me now 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.169
 alternative so if you are there somehow 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.349
 have written a recipe very much like 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.669
 in the info box or a link or something 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.440
 that you want the Rheinpark because I want 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.560
 be sure to do something like that 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.880
 guacamole could eat it every day and 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.099
 then we will stop to eat 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.570
 I have the edition 8 of the food and 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.360
 of course, get a drink 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.509
 scrolled right back and give me some 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.349
 selected recipes I cooked for 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:48.780
 I did that in the last video 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.630
 it is told this menu plan behind 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.830
 gives on the then different 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.480
 recipes have been put together for 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.990
 right menus and I have one 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.490
 this vegetarian mediterranean menu 1 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.770
 imitation of a green minister without 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.260
 with young peas and savoy cabbage 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.370
 a tomato eggplant pasta with 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:14.440
 fungi and one million grand jury with 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.150
 ginger is that and so delicious and I like it 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.370
 the stop rather than the other eat and 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.990
 Drink that still exists because that's real 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.240
 Always recipes are where you are not all too 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.960
 many things are always needed 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.640
 local karl seasonal vegetables and 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.590
 fruit varieties that somehow recycled 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.420
 and it's not too many 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.650
 Ingredients It is usually very convenient 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.150
 does not take too long so i would 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.730
 I'd like to eat the menu right away 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.620
 By the way, it was amazingly delicious 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.630
 me actually in this month extremely 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.370
 I bought a lot of broccoli and ate it 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.620
 I do not know why but somehow I have 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.970
 They made every break soup out of it 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.520
 made and I believe you can do it 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.560
 even so green checks to the green 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.690
 make smoothies in little certainly 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.120
 know spinach and so but broccoli 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.090
 I also love colleagues and he 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.070
 just supplies so many good nutrients 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.440
 very good and of course last 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.360
 a very important music I saved 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.790
 I landed at Frank Ocean again 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.040
 I think the smi believe in Munich 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.400
 been or is still improved 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.900
 me and I actually wanted to go 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.660
 that was exactly who was already and 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.330
 But I have written clauses and 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.490
 I usually get her out a lot more 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.070
 like to go up and down I love 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.490
 the two songs and, above all, out 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.510
 i think it's such a great song cool 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.550
 Song and I think there is also one 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.080
 I do not know yet if this is in the video 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.650
 can watch Germany that's because 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.570
 always like this 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.680
 with the gema even if I frank too 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.229
 no chance at the beginning 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.530
 I wanted to give his music 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.639
 actually very much and that was it 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.389
 also on the one hand fashion &amp; fun 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.370
 favorites 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:49.930
 I think it was a shorter video me 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.280
 i 'm not sure i say that 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.650
 somehow anytime I lower that and 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.530
 then there are still 15 minutes but 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.780
 Nonetheless , I often hope so 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.889
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.400
 if I like it and then up 

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:05.400
 next time
