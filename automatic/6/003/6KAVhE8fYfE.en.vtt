measurements and build a set of bike up
to<00:00:22.619> basically<00:00:22.920> help<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.730> fit<00:00:24.300> issues<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:25.080> it

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
to basically help with fit issues be it

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.609 
to basically help with fit issues be it
something<00:00:25.770> uncomfortable<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.289> knee<00:00:28.289> or

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
something uncomfortable like a knee or

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.340 
something uncomfortable like a knee or
lower<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.430> or<00:00:29.850> maybe<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> saddle<00:00:30.539> issue<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
lower back or maybe a saddle issue so

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.990 
lower back or maybe a saddle issue so
even<00:00:31.650> maybe<00:00:31.830> setting<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.400> up<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.790> where

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
even maybe setting you up to where

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.810 
even maybe setting you up to where
you're<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.840> most<00:00:34.019> efficient<00:00:34.710> position<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you're at your most efficient position I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
you're at your most efficient position I
can<00:00:36.300> take<00:00:36.479> a<00:00:36.510> current<00:00:36.870> athlete<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.769> look<00:00:38.159> at

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
can take a current athlete and look at

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
can take a current athlete and look at
biomechanics<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.720> set<00:00:40.050> them<00:00:40.229> up<00:00:40.470> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
biomechanics and actually set them up so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
biomechanics and actually set them up so
that<00:00:40.890> they<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.220> be<00:00:41.339> the<00:00:41.790> most<00:00:42.120> efficient

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that they can be the most efficient

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
that they can be the most efficient
position<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.650> produce<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:44.280> maximum<00:00:44.430> amount

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
position to produce the maximum amount

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
position to produce the maximum amount
of<00:00:45.030> power<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.420> which<00:00:45.540> they<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.839> produce<00:00:46.140> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of power in which they can produce so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
of power in which they can produce so
let's<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.100> started<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> fit<00:00:47.909> any<00:00:48.629> time<00:00:48.750> I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
up a little bit cuz I know you're
stronger<00:01:35.729> than<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.439> what<00:01:37.439> he<00:01:37.560> wants<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> do

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
stronger than that what he wants to do

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
stronger than that what he wants to do
is<00:01:38.159> he<00:01:38.310> wants<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.640> basically<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> feel<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
is he wants to basically get a feel of

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.830 
is he wants to basically get a feel of
what<00:01:39.899> on<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.679> threshold<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> ten<00:01:42.479> ten

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
what on a threshold of one to ten ten

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
what on a threshold of one to ten ten
being<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> hardest<00:01:43.679> I<00:01:43.920> wanted<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> basically

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
being the hardest I wanted to basically

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
being the hardest I wanted to basically
start<00:01:45.119> pedaling<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> two<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.799> we're

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
start pedaling about a two because we're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.260 
start pedaling about a two because we're
gonna<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.189> three<00:01:47.490> readings<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.060> we're<00:01:48.179> gonna

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
gonna do three readings here we're gonna

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
gonna do three readings here we're gonna
do<00:01:48.420> him<00:01:48.569> at<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> 1/2<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:49.530> something<00:01:49.950> kind

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
do him at about a 1/2 to something kind

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.099 
do him at about a 1/2 to something kind
of<00:01:50.159> casual<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.359> were<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.780> shall

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
of casual as if you were going out shall

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.719 
of casual as if you were going out shall
for<00:01:52.439> kind<00:01:52.679> of<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:52.920> warmed<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.310> before<00:01:53.490> we

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
for kind of getting warmed up before we

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
for kind of getting warmed up before we
cross<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.270> river<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.719> then<00:01:55.439> something

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
cross over the river and then something

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
cross over the river and then something
you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.490> mid<00:01:56.700> level<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.179> then

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you know about mid level and then

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.880 
you know about mid level and then
something<00:01:57.630> hard<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.049> we're<00:01:58.259> coming<00:01:58.740> back

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
something hard as we're coming back

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.980 
something hard as we're coming back
across<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> river<00:01:59.569> alright<00:02:00.569> so<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:00.840> now

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
across the river alright so right now

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.649 
across the river alright so right now
Barry<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:01.439> pushing<00:02:01.859> out<00:02:01.979> about<00:02:02.189> 130<00:02:02.999> watts<00:02:03.240> so

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
Barry is pushing out about 130 watts so

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.209 
Barry is pushing out about 130 watts so
that's<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.350> gonna<00:02:04.439> go<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.679> catch<00:02:04.920> him

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that's when we're gonna go and catch him

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.669 
that's when we're gonna go and catch him
about<00:02:05.429> that<00:02:05.609> reading<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.929> this<00:02:07.049> Barry<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
about that reading so this Barry on the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.880 
about that reading so this Barry on the
screen<00:02:07.950> he's<00:02:08.160> he's<00:02:08.429> pedaling<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.380> now<00:02:10.619> seems

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
screen he's he's pedaling and now seems

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070 
screen he's he's pedaling and now seems
like<00:02:10.950> everything's<00:02:11.340> working<00:02:11.400> good<00:02:11.900> now<00:02:12.900> while

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
like everything's working good now while

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.160 
like everything's working good now while
this<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.319> going<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:15.030> camera<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.720> 15

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
this is going on the camera in 15

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.500 
this is going on the camera in 15
seconds<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:16.860> flash

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
seconds this flash

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.070 
seconds this flash
back<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.930> for<00:02:18.370> 475<00:02:19.370> times<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.450> when<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.780> let<00:02:21.050> it

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
back in for 475 times so when I let it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.990 
back in for 475 times so when I let it
run<00:02:21.349> for<00:02:21.620> another<00:02:21.890> ten<00:02:22.159> seconds<00:02:22.489> or<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:22.790> I'm

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
run for another ten seconds or so I'm

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.210 
run for another ten seconds or so I'm
assuming<00:02:23.269> about<00:02:23.480> another<00:02:23.780> 200<00:02:24.680> captures

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
assuming about another 200 captures

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.070 
assuming about another 200 captures
there<00:02:25.459> all<00:02:26.299> right<00:02:26.390> very<00:02:26.569> let's<00:02:26.750> go<00:02:26.840> ahead<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
there all right very let's go ahead and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.300 
there all right very let's go ahead and
pump<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.349> up<00:02:27.440> -<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.620> hard<00:02:27.860> effort

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
pump it up - a hard effort

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.580 
pump it up - a hard effort
so<00:02:29.000> now<00:02:29.150> Barry's<00:02:29.540> pushing<00:02:29.870> close<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.170> 400

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
so now Barry's pushing close to 400

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.009 
so now Barry's pushing close to 400
watts<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.239> let's<00:02:32.239> see<00:02:32.360> if<00:02:32.450> he<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:32.690> hold<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.959> for

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
watts so let's see if he can hold it for

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.300 
watts so let's see if he can hold it for
15-20<00:02:33.680> seconds<00:02:34.310> here<00:02:35.920> all<00:02:36.920> right<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.220> can

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
15-20 seconds here all right you can

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.699 
15-20 seconds here all right you can
cool<00:02:37.489> down<00:02:37.810> that's<00:02:38.810> what<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.080> was<00:02:39.200> doing<00:02:39.379> that

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
cool down that's what it was doing that

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.430 
cool down that's what it was doing that
is<00:02:39.799> 475<00:02:40.730> times<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.239> was<00:02:41.360> flashing<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.260> was

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
is 475 times that it was flashing it was

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.650 
is 475 times that it was flashing it was
taking<00:02:42.739> an<00:02:42.830> average<00:02:43.129> of<00:02:43.670> these<00:02:44.030> different

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
taking an average of these different

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.880 
taking an average of these different
categories<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.319> these<00:02:45.560> different

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
categories and these different

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.319 
categories and these different
categories<00:02:46.010> are<00:02:46.400> we're<00:02:46.519> going<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.849> use<00:02:47.000> to

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
categories are we're going to use to

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.750 
categories are we're going to use to
help<00:02:47.569> basically<00:02:48.140> fit<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.829> bike<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.250> Barry<00:02:49.519> R

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
help basically fit the bike to Barry R

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.089 
help basically fit the bike to Barry R
and<00:02:50.060> if<00:02:50.599> someone<00:02:51.079> was<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.349> her<00:02:51.500> we<00:02:51.739> would<00:02:51.920> help

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
and if someone was in her we would help

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.309 
and if someone was in her we would help
determine<00:02:52.670> how<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.849> adjust<00:02:53.690> things<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.140> make

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
determine how to adjust things to make

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.770 
determine how to adjust things to make
them<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:55.069> know<00:02:55.160> more<00:02:55.400> comfortable<00:02:55.670> well<00:02:56.540> out

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
them you know more comfortable well out

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.420 
them you know more comfortable well out
of<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.019> these<00:02:57.170> numbers<00:02:57.379> since<00:02:57.769> Barry's<00:02:58.250> not

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
of all these numbers since Barry's not

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.789 
of all these numbers since Barry's not
having<00:02:58.790> any<00:02:58.970> pains<00:02:59.359> or<00:02:59.599> discomforts<00:03:00.319> we're

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
having any pains or discomforts we're

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.080 
having any pains or discomforts we're
really<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.220> trying<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.489> make<00:03:01.609> him<00:03:01.790> maybe<00:03:01.970> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
really just trying to make him maybe a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.640 
really just trying to make him maybe a
little<00:03:02.180> bit<00:03:02.329> more<00:03:02.510> efficient<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.170> bike<00:03:03.379> so

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
little bit more efficient on the bike so

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.140 
little bit more efficient on the bike so
we<00:03:03.769> want<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.010> look<00:03:04.069> at<00:03:04.220> him<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.459> see<00:03:04.640> how<00:03:05.090> we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
we want to look at him and see how we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.390 
we want to look at him and see how we
can<00:03:05.390> position<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.900> bike<00:03:06.079> maybe<00:03:06.859> like<00:03:07.220> say

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
can position the bike maybe like say

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.729 
can position the bike maybe like say
make<00:03:07.609> him<00:03:07.730> help<00:03:07.910> even<00:03:08.120> produce<00:03:08.239> more<00:03:08.510> power<00:03:08.750> so

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
make him help even produce more power so

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.140 
make him help even produce more power so
we're<00:03:09.859> going<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> take<00:03:10.310> about<00:03:10.430> four<00:03:10.879> or<00:03:10.970> five

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
we're going to take about four or five

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.300 
we're going to take about four or five
of<00:03:11.299> these<00:03:11.390> key<00:03:11.629> measurements<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.410> see<00:03:13.160> how

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
of these key measurements and see how

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.699 
of these key measurements and see how
they<00:03:13.579> set<00:03:14.000> up<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.359> norm<00:03:14.599> here<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.500> this

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
they set up to the norm here so this

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.160 
they set up to the norm here so this
machine<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:17.150> basically<00:03:17.569> showing<00:03:17.959> me

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
machine is just basically showing me

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.780 
machine is just basically showing me
kind<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> what<00:03:18.620> Barry<00:03:18.829> does<00:03:19.099> so<00:03:19.370> as<00:03:19.579> I'm

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
kind of what Barry does so as I'm

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.250 
kind of what Barry does so as I'm
looking<00:03:19.940> at<00:03:20.120> these<00:03:20.209> numbers<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:20.930> start

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
looking at these numbers I can start

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.690 
looking at these numbers I can start
thinking<00:03:21.500> about<00:03:21.739> things<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.340> might<00:03:22.549> need

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
thinking about things that I might need

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.420 
thinking about things that I might need
to<00:03:22.819> do<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.120> help<00:03:23.239> adjust<00:03:23.720> him<00:03:24.280> another<00:03:25.280> thing

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
to do to help adjust him another thing

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.890 
to do to help adjust him another thing
we're<00:03:25.579> gonna<00:03:25.669> want<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.060> look<00:03:26.209> at<00:03:26.389> here<00:03:26.599> is<00:03:26.720> your

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
we're gonna want to look at here is your

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.409 
we're gonna want to look at here is your
hip<00:03:27.049> angle<00:03:27.230> closure<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.760> thing<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.209> see

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
hip angle closure the thing that I see

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.789 
hip angle closure the thing that I see
here<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.780> reason<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.109> think<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:30.440> saddle

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
here and the reason I think the saddle

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.020 
here and the reason I think the saddle
can<00:03:30.950> go<00:03:31.040> up<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.280> little<00:03:31.370> bit<00:03:31.579> it's<00:03:31.700> cause<00:03:31.849> his

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
can go up a little bit it's cause his

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.240 
can go up a little bit it's cause his
hips<00:03:32.329> pretty<00:03:32.660> open<00:03:33.109> right<00:03:33.290> now<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.799> we're

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
hips pretty open right now and we're

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.500 
hips pretty open right now and we're
actually<00:03:34.430> looking<00:03:34.849> at<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.120> one<00:03:35.239> here<00:03:35.329> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
actually looking at this one here the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.170 
actually looking at this one here the
hip<00:03:35.660> closure<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:36.440> he's<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.340> 60<00:03:37.970> range

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
hip closure so he's in that 60 range

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.990 
hip closure so he's in that 60 range
pretty<00:03:38.930> consistently<00:03:39.769> you<00:03:40.400> know<00:03:40.519> he<00:03:40.760> was<00:03:40.880> able

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
pretty consistently you know he was able

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.270 
pretty consistently you know he was able
to<00:03:41.180> get<00:03:41.359> 52<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.590> was<00:03:42.680> probably<00:03:42.859> cause<00:03:43.130> he

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
to get 52 but I was probably cause he

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.309 
to get 52 but I was probably cause he
dropped<00:03:43.549> pretty<00:03:43.940> significantly<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:44.750> with

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
dropped pretty significantly there with

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.250 
dropped pretty significantly there with
his<00:03:45.500> elbow<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.099> he<00:03:46.220> closed<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.730> off<00:03:46.849> so<00:03:47.599> he

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
his elbow so he closed it off so he

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.610 
his elbow so he closed it off so he
could<00:03:48.440> actually<00:03:48.650> afford<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.400> come<00:03:50.349> saddle<00:03:51.349> up

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
could actually afford to come saddle up

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.190 
could actually afford to come saddle up
which<00:03:52.190> would<00:03:52.400> change<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.880> profile<00:03:53.630> from<00:03:53.930> his

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
which would change the profile from his

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.800 
which would change the profile from his
saddle<00:03:55.010> height<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.549> his<00:03:55.730> handlebars<00:03:56.480> that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
saddle height to his handlebars that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.990 
saddle height to his handlebars that
would<00:03:57.380> close<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.680> off<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.069> little<00:03:58.519> bit<00:03:58.760> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
would close that off a little bit and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.520 
would close that off a little bit and
still<00:03:59.480> be<00:03:59.660> able<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.900> produce<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.290> little<00:04:00.410> bit

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
still be able to produce a little bit

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.159 
still be able to produce a little bit
more<00:04:00.739> power<00:04:01.010> I've<00:04:01.879> gotten<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.389> see<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.569> lot<00:04:02.959> of

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
more power I've gotten to see a lot of

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.559 
more power I've gotten to see a lot of
different<00:04:03.790> graphs<00:04:04.790> here<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.239> it's<00:04:05.359> kind<00:04:05.480> of

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
different graphs here and it's kind of

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.809 
different graphs here and it's kind of
interesting<00:04:06.079> what<00:04:06.200> people<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:06.829> but<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:07.669> is

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
interesting what people do but this is

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.030 
interesting what people do but this is
actually<00:04:08.150> tracking<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:09.200> knee<00:04:09.470> marker<00:04:09.889> that

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
actually tracking that knee marker that

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.500 
actually tracking that knee marker that
was<00:04:10.129> on<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.370> side<00:04:10.639> of<00:04:10.790> his<00:04:10.910> knee<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:11.329> that's

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
was on the side of his knee so that's

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.789 
was on the side of his knee so that's
not<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.810> bottom<00:04:12.109> of<00:04:12.230> his<00:04:12.349> foot<00:04:12.560> that's

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
not the bottom of his foot that's

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.589 
not the bottom of his foot that's
actually<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.549> motion<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.030> which<00:04:14.150> his<00:04:14.329> knees

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
actually the motion in which his knees

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.390 
actually the motion in which his knees
doing<00:04:14.949> right<00:04:15.949> there

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
doing right there

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.420 
doing right there
so<00:04:16.760> you'll<00:04:16.940> see<00:04:17.120> his<00:04:17.359> his<00:04:17.959> left<00:04:18.289> knee<00:04:18.530> how<00:04:19.250> it

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
so you'll see his his left knee how it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.510 
so you'll see his his left knee how it
moves<00:04:19.729> having<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.750> loop<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.859> his<00:04:22.039> right<00:04:22.310> knee

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
moves having a loop to his right knee

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.490 
moves having a loop to his right knee
and<00:04:23.120> how<00:04:23.240> this<00:04:23.419> one's<00:04:23.690> kind<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:23.960> cantering<00:04:24.289> out

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
and how this one's kind of cantering out

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.080 
and how this one's kind of cantering out
how<00:04:24.740> we<00:04:24.800> sell<00:04:25.130> out<00:04:25.340> one's<00:04:25.550> kind<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.909> stays

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
how we sell out one's kind of stays

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.600 
how we sell out one's kind of stays
fairly<00:04:26.419> straight<00:04:26.810> up<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.080> down<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:28.580> know

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
fairly straight up and down so you know

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.399 
fairly straight up and down so you know
that's<00:04:28.820> what<00:04:29.060> Barry<00:04:29.270> does<00:04:29.539> you<00:04:29.870> know<00:04:29.990> Barry's

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
that's what Barry does you know Barry's

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.279 
that's what Barry does you know Barry's
not<00:04:30.560> complaining

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
not complaining

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.070 
not complaining
any<00:04:31.889> problems<00:04:32.490> but<00:04:32.969> if<00:04:33.119> he<00:04:33.240> was<00:04:33.509> that'd<00:04:33.930> be

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
any problems but if he was that'd be

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.299 
any problems but if he was that'd be
something<00:04:34.319> that<00:04:34.529> we<00:04:34.649> would<00:04:34.830> look<00:04:35.039> at

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:35.309 
something that we would look at

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.100 
something that we would look at
something<00:04:36.089> that<00:04:36.119> I<00:04:36.240> want<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:36.569> look<00:04:36.779> at<00:04:36.960> here

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
something that I want to look at here

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.600 
something that I want to look at here
because<00:04:37.259> he's<00:04:37.559> got<00:04:37.740> one<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.219> does<00:04:38.399> a<00:04:38.430> little

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
because he's got one that does a little

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.649 
because he's got one that does a little
bit<00:04:38.759> more<00:04:38.969> than<00:04:39.149> the<00:04:39.240> other<00:04:39.360> words<00:04:39.569> we're

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
bit more than the other words we're

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.439 
bit more than the other words we're
gonna<00:04:39.749> look<00:04:39.899> at<00:04:40.050> his<00:04:40.139> cleat<00:04:40.409> positioning<00:04:41.449> he

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
gonna look at his cleat positioning he

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.480 
gonna look at his cleat positioning he
can<00:04:42.749> just<00:04:43.139> because<00:04:43.409> he<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:43.979> kind<00:04:44.189> of<00:04:44.219> stuck

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
can just because he just kind of stuck

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.859 
can just because he just kind of stuck
him<00:04:44.639> on<00:04:44.729> there<00:04:44.969> and<00:04:45.149> kind<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.389> lined<00:04:45.629> them<00:04:45.809> up

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:45.869 
him on there and kind of lined them up

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.950 
him on there and kind of lined them up
by<00:04:46.020> eyeball<00:04:47.149> they<00:04:48.149> could<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.419> off<00:04:48.569> just<00:04:48.839> a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
by eyeball they could be off just a

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.409 
by eyeball they could be off just a
little<00:04:48.990> bit<00:04:49.259> or<00:04:49.669> because<00:04:50.669> of<00:04:50.819> his<00:04:50.969> natural

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
little bit or because of his natural

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.600 
little bit or because of his natural
thing<00:04:51.659> like<00:04:51.899> we're<00:04:52.080> saying<00:04:52.319> I<00:04:52.619> feel<00:04:53.219> like<00:04:53.430> he's

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
thing like we're saying I feel like he's

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.839 
thing like we're saying I feel like he's
got<00:04:53.789> his<00:04:54.499> right<00:04:55.499> let<00:04:56.039> me<00:04:56.069> see<00:04:56.219> which<00:04:56.309> one<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.669> it

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
got his right let me see which one is it

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.790 
got his right let me see which one is it
I'm<00:04:57.569> thinking<00:04:57.899> his<00:04:57.990> left<00:04:58.229> side<00:04:58.439> is<00:04:58.559> a<00:04:58.619> little

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
I'm thinking his left side is a little

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.559 
I'm thinking his left side is a little
bit<00:04:58.889> longer<00:04:59.099> than<00:04:59.309> his<00:04:59.490> right<00:04:59.669> side<00:04:59.879> so

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
bit longer than his right side so

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.989 
bit longer than his right side so
because<00:05:01.169> of<00:05:01.349> that<00:05:01.379> his<00:05:01.860> his<00:05:02.189> foots<00:05:02.550> moving<00:05:02.639> a

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
because of that his his foots moving a

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.399 
because of that his his foots moving a
little<00:05:03.149> differently<00:05:03.539> we<00:05:04.050> can<00:05:04.229> actually

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
little differently we can actually

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.969 
little differently we can actually
probably<00:05:04.919> set<00:05:05.129> the<00:05:05.279> cleat<00:05:05.580> up<00:05:06.259> on<00:05:07.259> his<00:05:07.619> left

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
probably set the cleat up on his left

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.449 
probably set the cleat up on his left
then<00:05:08.639> maybe<00:05:08.879> towards<00:05:09.869> the<00:05:10.020> inside<00:05:10.469> so<00:05:11.249> that<00:05:11.279> it

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:11.459 
then maybe towards the inside so that it

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:13.279 
then maybe towards the inside so that it
brings<00:05:11.759> his<00:05:11.939> foot<00:05:12.209> out<00:05:12.240> from<00:05:12.599> underneath<00:05:13.020> him

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
brings his foot out from underneath him

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.540 
brings his foot out from underneath him
a<00:05:13.379> little<00:05:13.589> bit<00:05:13.709> so<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:13.889> he'll<00:05:14.099> get<00:05:14.249> a<00:05:14.309> little

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
a little bit so that he'll get a little

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.639 
a little bit so that he'll get a little
bit<00:05:14.639> more<00:05:14.789> of<00:05:14.879> a<00:05:14.939> smooth<00:05:15.569> stroke<00:05:15.959> so<00:05:16.409> that<00:05:16.439> he's

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:16.649 
bit more of a smooth stroke so that he's

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.989 
bit more of a smooth stroke so that he's
moving<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.009> little<00:05:17.099> bit<00:05:17.249> more<00:05:17.399> straight<00:05:17.699> up<00:05:17.819> and

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:17.999 
moving a little bit more straight up and

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.579 
moving a little bit more straight up and
downs<00:05:18.209> something<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> noticed<00:05:19.409> there<00:05:19.559> I

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:19.589 
downs something that I noticed there I

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:21.109 
downs something that I noticed there I
wanted<00:05:19.919> this<00:05:20.069> saddle<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.580> come<00:05:20.729> up<00:05:20.879> a<00:05:20.969> little

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:21.119 
wanted this saddle to come up a little

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:22.790 
wanted this saddle to come up a little
higher<00:05:21.300> because<00:05:21.539> what<00:05:21.959> he's<00:05:22.080> doing<00:05:22.379> with<00:05:22.589> is

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
higher because what he's doing with is

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.279 
higher because what he's doing with is
when<00:05:23.069> he<00:05:23.129> goes<00:05:23.249> harder<00:05:23.669> how<00:05:23.789> he<00:05:23.849> moves<00:05:24.180> so<00:05:24.899> I

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
when he goes harder how he moves so I

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.019 
when he goes harder how he moves so I
started<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.860> move<00:05:25.979> him<00:05:26.159> up<00:05:26.309> five<00:05:26.520> millimeters

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
started to move him up five millimeters

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.309 
started to move him up five millimeters
but<00:05:27.149> when<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.300> did<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:27.569> I<00:05:27.719> noticed<00:05:27.809> how<00:05:28.199> his

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
but when I did that I noticed how his

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.980 
but when I did that I noticed how his
saddle<00:05:28.770> was<00:05:29.129> tilted<00:05:29.699> so<00:05:30.330> instead<00:05:30.749> of<00:05:30.899> moving

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
saddle was tilted so instead of moving

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.899 
saddle was tilted so instead of moving
him<00:05:31.259> up<00:05:31.349> I<00:05:31.529> ended<00:05:31.709> up<00:05:31.830> putting<00:05:32.099> a<00:05:32.219> saddle<00:05:32.430> level

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
him up I ended up putting a saddle level

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.459 
him up I ended up putting a saddle level
and<00:05:33.119> I<00:05:33.330> actually<00:05:33.419> brought<00:05:33.719> him<00:05:33.930> back<00:05:34.169> down<00:05:34.439> to

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
and I actually brought him back down to

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.790 
and I actually brought him back down to
neutral<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.189> then<00:05:35.459> moved<00:05:35.669> in<00:05:35.789> five<00:05:35.999> down<00:05:36.589> so<00:05:37.589> I

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
neutral and then moved in five down so I

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.619 
neutral and then moved in five down so I
moved<00:05:38.099> to<00:05:38.189> saddle<00:05:38.490> five<00:05:38.699> down<00:05:38.879> but<00:05:39.180> out<00:05:39.300> I

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
moved to saddle five down but out I

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.290 
moved to saddle five down but out I
leveled<00:05:40.319> this<00:05:40.469> saddle<00:05:40.830> out<00:05:41.009> so<00:05:41.759> I<00:05:41.789> want<00:05:42.089> to<00:05:42.149> see

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
leveled this saddle out so I want to see

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.269 
leveled this saddle out so I want to see
how<00:05:42.479> that<00:05:42.749> affected<00:05:43.139> him<00:05:43.379> and<00:05:43.620> how<00:05:43.769> he<00:05:43.830> sits<00:05:44.129> on

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
how that affected him and how he sits on

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.799 
how that affected him and how he sits on
the<00:05:44.370> saddle<00:05:44.639> you<00:05:44.699> know<00:05:44.759> see<00:05:44.999> if<00:05:45.120> he<00:05:45.240> moves<00:05:45.539> as

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:45.809 
the saddle you know see if he moves as

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:48.139 
the saddle you know see if he moves as
much<00:05:46.409> now<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.649> he<00:05:46.889> doesn't<00:05:47.099> have<00:05:47.309> that<00:05:47.339> that

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:48.149 
much now that he doesn't have that that

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.869 
much now that he doesn't have that that
sliding<00:05:48.539> slide<00:05:49.169> on<00:05:49.439> there<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.889> adjusting<00:05:50.759> his

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
sliding slide on there I adjusting his

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.959 
sliding slide on there I adjusting his
saddle<00:05:51.209> height<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:52.459> adjusting<00:05:53.459> the<00:05:53.580> saddle

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
saddle height and adjusting the saddle

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.540 
saddle height and adjusting the saddle
tilt<00:05:54.449> we<00:05:55.139> were<00:05:55.199> able<00:05:55.409> to<00:05:55.469> accomplish<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:56.339> knee

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
tilt we were able to accomplish a knee

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.429 
tilt we were able to accomplish a knee
angle<00:05:56.789> that's<00:05:57.209> going<00:05:57.449> to<00:05:57.509> put<00:05:57.689> him<00:05:57.719> his

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
angle that's going to put him his

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.809 
angle that's going to put him his
biomechanics<00:05:59.249> in<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.459> better<00:05:59.639> position

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
biomechanics in a better position

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.179 
biomechanics in a better position
basically<00:06:00.479> we<00:06:01.019> also<00:06:01.229> didn't<00:06:01.709> change<00:06:01.919> we<00:06:02.039> also

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
basically we also didn't change we also

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.070 
basically we also didn't change we also
changed<00:06:02.669> this<00:06:02.849> but<00:06:03.089> we<00:06:03.149> also<00:06:03.269> changed<00:06:03.719> his<00:06:03.869> hip

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
changed this but we also changed his hip

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.389 
changed this but we also changed his hip
angle<00:06:04.289> so<00:06:04.919> hip<00:06:05.159> angle<00:06:05.809> knee<00:06:06.809> extension<00:06:07.439> and<00:06:07.860> we

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:08.399 
angle so hip angle knee extension and we

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:11.119 
angle so hip angle knee extension and we
also<00:06:08.550> changed<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.330> tilt<00:06:09.599> of<00:06:09.779> his<00:06:09.959> leg<00:06:10.289> all<00:06:10.769> by

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
also changed the tilt of his leg all by

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.009 
also changed the tilt of his leg all by
making<00:06:11.459> some<00:06:11.580> adjustments<00:06:11.669> to<00:06:12.119> the<00:06:12.569> saddle

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:13.019 
making some adjustments to the saddle

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:15.320 
making some adjustments to the saddle
positioning<00:06:13.619> the<00:06:14.069> saddle<00:06:14.459> height<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:14.999> also

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
positioning the saddle height and also

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.350 
positioning the saddle height and also
by<00:06:15.509> tilting<00:06:15.779> here<00:06:16.259> and<00:06:16.409> by<00:06:16.979> Justin<00:06:17.430> his<00:06:17.610> cleat

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
by tilting here and by Justin his cleat

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.259 
by tilting here and by Justin his cleat
on<00:06:18.509> the<00:06:18.599> bottom<00:06:19.249> so<00:06:20.249> three<00:06:20.729> little<00:06:20.939> three

creates<00:06:33.059> of<00:06:33.209> discomfort<00:06:33.599> then<00:06:33.930> we'll<00:06:34.110> come

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
creates of discomfort then we'll come

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.689

back and we'll talk about it and make
adjustments<00:06:36.330> as<00:06:36.449> that<00:06:36.659> bill<00:06:36.899> but<00:06:37.409> I<00:06:37.709> don't

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
adjustments as that bill but I don't

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.339 
adjustments as that bill but I don't
think<00:06:38.279> the<00:06:38.659> adjustments<00:06:39.659> that<00:06:39.719> we<00:06:39.870> made<00:06:40.110> were

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
think the adjustments that we made were

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.929 
think the adjustments that we made were
significant<00:06:40.979> enough<00:06:41.189> adjustments<00:06:41.729> that<00:06:41.819> it

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
significant enough adjustments that it

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.119 
significant enough adjustments that it
should<00:06:42.089> bother<00:06:42.269> him

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
should bother him

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.610 
should bother him
dramatically
