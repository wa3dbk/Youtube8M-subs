00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.940 
can see she seemed to roost on that just
fine<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.140> morning<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> came<00:02:40.770> in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
fine and this morning when I came in

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.620 
fine and this morning when I came in
there<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.340> somebody<00:02:41.550> up<00:02:41.820> on<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> top<00:02:42.300> here

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
there was somebody up on the top here

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.190 
there was somebody up on the top here
actually<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.760> they're<00:02:44.760> using<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.330> they're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
actually so they're using it they're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.400 
actually so they're using it they're
flying<00:02:46.620> around<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:48.360> also<00:02:48.570> figured<00:02:49.080> out<00:02:49.350> a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
flying around and I also figured out a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.850 
flying around and I also figured out a
way<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:50.400> minimize<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.959> amount<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.350> wood<00:02:52.560> chips

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
way to minimize the amount of wood chips

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.280 
way to minimize the amount of wood chips
and<00:02:53.100> stuff<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.640> are<00:02:53.790> getting<00:02:54.030> into<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
and stuff that are getting into the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.250 
and stuff that are getting into the
water<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.790> platform<00:02:57.360> over<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
water that platform over there is

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.479 
water that platform over there is
actually<00:02:58.769> an<00:02:58.920> old<00:02:59.040> shelf<00:02:59.600> off<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.959> an<00:03:01.080> old

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
actually an old shelf off of an old

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.080 
actually an old shelf off of an old
computer<00:03:02.489> desk<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:04.049> no<00:03:04.410> longer<00:03:04.440> own<00:03:05.090> but

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
computer desk that I no longer own but

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.030 
computer desk that I no longer own but
the<00:03:06.239> shelves<00:03:06.630> seemed<00:03:06.959> like<00:03:07.110> good<00:03:07.260> ideas<00:03:07.799> so<00:03:08.010> i

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the shelves seemed like good ideas so i

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.370 
the shelves seemed like good ideas so i
kept<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.340> brackets<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:09.510> them<00:03:09.750> had<00:03:09.900> no<00:03:10.080> idea<00:03:10.320> at

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
kept the brackets on them had no idea at

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.320 
kept the brackets on them had no idea at
the<00:03:10.470> time<00:03:10.500> when<00:03:10.860> i<00:03:10.920> was<00:03:11.070> keeping<00:03:11.280> them<00:03:11.519> but

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the time when i was keeping them but

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.759 
the time when i was keeping them but
they<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.660> made<00:03:12.870> perfect<00:03:13.320> little<00:03:13.470> raised

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
they have made perfect little raised

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.970 
they have made perfect little raised
platforms<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.959> helps<00:03:15.959> minimize<00:03:16.410> doesn't

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
platforms that helps minimize doesn't

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.800 
platforms that helps minimize doesn't
eliminate<00:03:17.190> completely<00:03:17.580> but<00:03:18.180> helps<00:03:18.390> minimize

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
eliminate completely but helps minimize

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.410 
eliminate completely but helps minimize
getting<00:03:19.230> wood<00:03:19.890> chips<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.549> chicken<00:03:20.940> poop<00:03:21.090> in

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
getting wood chips and chicken poop in

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.979 
getting wood chips and chicken poop in
their<00:03:22.170> water<00:03:22.910> your<00:03:23.910> food<00:03:24.180> doesn't<00:03:24.570> seem<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.840> be

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
their water your food doesn't seem to be

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.870 
their water your food doesn't seem to be
too<00:03:25.019> much<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.500> problem<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.400> kind<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.700> left

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
too much of a problem so I kind of left

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.810 
too much of a problem so I kind of left
that<00:03:27.090> alone<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.989> over<00:03:28.500> here<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.430> used<00:03:29.670> a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
that alone and over here I just used a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.780 
that alone and over here I just used a
small<00:03:30.090> cardboard<00:03:30.390> box<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.950> elevate<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.340> small

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
small cardboard box to elevate the small

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.080 
small cardboard box to elevate the small
quart<00:03:33.180> mason<00:03:33.420> jar<00:03:33.920> waterer

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
quart mason jar waterer

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.650 
quart mason jar waterer
so<00:03:36.660> here<00:03:36.989> we<00:03:37.110> are<00:03:37.260> day<00:03:38.129> day<00:03:38.640> where<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.239> day

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
so here we are day day where are we day

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.440 
so here we are day day where are we day
10<00:03:39.900> yes<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:41.099> somebody<00:03:41.489> trying<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.819> fly<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
10 yes there somebody trying to fly and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.800 
10 yes there somebody trying to fly and
they've<00:03:42.959> actually<00:03:43.340> backed<00:03:44.340> into<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.480> chicken

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
they've actually backed into the chicken

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.350 
they've actually backed into the chicken
wire<00:03:45.980> trying<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.099> fly<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.910> kind<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.120> fun

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
wire trying to fly so it's kind of fun

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.390 
wire trying to fly so it's kind of fun
but<00:03:49.140> here<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.590> substantially<00:03:50.280> more

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
but here they have substantially more

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.640 
but here they have substantially more
room<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.910> we<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.840> moved<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.170> red<00:03:52.410> lights

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
room and we have moved to red lights

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.320 
room and we have moved to red lights
even<00:03:53.340> though<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.459> have<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.760> overhead<00:03:54.120> lights

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
even though I have the overhead lights

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.420 
even though I have the overhead lights
on<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.200> moment<00:03:55.319> so<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:55.830> video<00:03:56.099> will<00:03:56.250> turn

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
on at the moment so this video will turn

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.280 
on at the moment so this video will turn
out<00:03:56.549> better<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.420> also<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.750> get<00:03:57.930> them<00:03:58.049> up<00:03:58.200> and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
out better and also to get them up and

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.039 
out better and also to get them up and
active<00:03:58.940> but<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.030> red<00:04:00.180> lights<00:04:00.420> allow<00:04:00.720> them<00:04:00.930> to

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
active but the red lights allow them to

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.699 
active but the red lights allow them to
sleep<00:04:01.319> much<00:04:01.739> better<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:03.569> wonder<00:04:04.019> what<00:04:04.170> day<00:04:04.319> 11

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
sleep much better so wonder what day 11

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.400 
sleep much better so wonder what day 11
is<00:04:04.830> going<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.190> hold
