00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
going to continue another special

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.780 
going to continue another special
segment<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.740> peripheral<00:00:08.250> vascular

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
segment on the peripheral vascular

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.610 
segment on the peripheral vascular
system<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.420> today<00:00:10.050> we're<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.410> talk

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
system and today we're going to talk

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.360 
system and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.309> really<00:00:12.030> important<00:00:12.950> organs<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
about the really important organs the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.420 
about the really important organs the
kidneys<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.900> anyways<00:00:16.260> your<00:00:16.650> kidneys<00:00:17.130> are

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
kidneys so anyways your kidneys are

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.750 
kidneys so anyways your kidneys are
super<00:00:18.330> important<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.590> balance<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.220> your

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
super important for the balance of your

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.630 
super important for the balance of your
blood<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.619> keeping<00:00:22.619> all<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> electrolytes

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
blood and keeping all the electrolytes

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.820 
blood and keeping all the electrolytes
and<00:00:23.939> chemicals<00:00:24.769> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.099> appropriate<00:00:26.460> on

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
and chemicals in the appropriate on

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.640 
and chemicals in the appropriate on
concentrations<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.849> does<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> through

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
concentrations and it does that through

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
concentrations and it does that through
filtration<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> big<00:00:33.180> filter

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
filtration so it's like a big filter

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.430 
filtration so it's like a big filter
system<00:00:34.250> for<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.430> blood<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:37.200> very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
system for your blood and it's very

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280 
system for your blood and it's very
complex<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.480> many<00:00:39.690> things<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> your

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
complex but like many things in your

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.830 
complex but like many things in your
body<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.370> keeps<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.820> ticking<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> doing

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
body it just keeps on ticking and doing

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920 
body it just keeps on ticking and doing
its<00:00:43.020> job<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> give<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.360> brief

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
its job so I'm going to give a brief

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.310 
its job so I'm going to give a brief
presentation<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:47.280> our<00:00:47.309> picture<00:00:48.079> that<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
presentation to our picture that we

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.380 
presentation to our picture that we
presented<00:00:49.739> before<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
presented before and this is the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
presented before and this is the
abdominal<00:00:54.390> aorta<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.250> right

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
abdominal aorta and you will see right

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
abdominal aorta and you will see right
there<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> middle<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> picture<00:00:58.760> on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
there in the middle of the picture on

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.360 
there in the middle of the picture on
the<00:00:59.820> left<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.370> kidneys

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the left and on the right the kidneys

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.630 
the left and on the right the kidneys
and<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:04.110> blue<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> inferior<00:01:06.150> vena<00:01:06.360> cava

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
and in blue is the inferior vena cava

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
and in blue is the inferior vena cava
and<00:01:08.640> has<00:01:08.939> branches<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.840> extend<00:01:10.619> into<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and has branches that extend into the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.020 
and has branches that extend into the
kidneys<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:12.360> red<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.310> abdominal

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
kidneys and in red is the abdominal

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.410 
kidneys and in red is the abdominal
aorta<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.770> these

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
aorta so that's that and then these

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.640 
aorta so that's that and then these
these<00:01:21.420> next<00:01:21.930> paintings<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.130> incredible

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
these next paintings are just incredible

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.060 
these next paintings are just incredible
this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:27.240> detail<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> kidney<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.680> how

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this is the detail of the kidney and how

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.179 
this is the detail of the kidney and how
it<00:01:29.490> filters<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.240> blood<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.290> stay<00:01:32.040> tuned<00:01:32.280> rudo

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
it filters your blood so stay tuned rudo

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.569 
it filters your blood so stay tuned rudo
so<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.549> we'll<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> look<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:37.579> little

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so first we'll take a look at a little

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.740 
so first we'll take a look at a little
bit<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.299> cross-section

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
bit of a cross-section

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.090 
bit of a cross-section
the<00:01:42.320> kicking<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.490> can<00:01:43.670> see<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:43.970> right<00:01:44.090> there

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
the kicking you can see it right there

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.800 
the kicking you can see it right there
and<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.550> side<00:01:46.760> there<00:01:47.060> again<00:01:47.330> you'll<00:01:47.570> see

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and on the side there again you'll see

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.770 
and on the side there again you'll see
the<00:01:47.960> abdominal<00:01:48.500> aorta<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.780> inferior

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
the abdominal aorta and the inferior

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.390 
the abdominal aorta and the inferior
vena<00:01:51.140> cava<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:55.030> yellowish<00:01:56.030> looking<00:01:56.450> to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
vena cava and that yellowish looking to

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.090 
vena cava and that yellowish looking to
that<00:01:58.400> starts<00:01:59.050> actually<00:02:00.050> at<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.710> center<00:02:01.040> of

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
that starts actually at the center of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760 
that starts actually at the center of
the<00:02:01.310> kidney<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.030> extends<00:02:02.600> down<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.140> then

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the kidney and extends down and then

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.510 
the kidney and extends down and then
downwards<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:06.220> where<00:02:07.539> urine<00:02:08.740> will<00:02:09.740> be<00:02:09.979> drained

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
downwards is where urine will be drained

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.580 
downwards is where urine will be drained
out<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:12.080> kidney<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.590> down<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.400> your<00:02:13.490> blab

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
out of the kidney and down to your blab

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.940 
out of the kidney and down to your blab
that<00:02:15.590> tube<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.340> called<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.090> order<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.680> let's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that tube is called the order so let's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.650 
that tube is called the order so let's
go<00:02:19.040> back<00:02:19.280> out<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.520> little<00:02:19.700> bit<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:20.360> we're

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
go back out a little bit and then we're

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.540 
go back out a little bit and then we're
going<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.870> go<00:02:21.080> into<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.500> other<00:02:21.709> detail<00:02:22.280> which

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
going to go into this other detail which

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.640 
going to go into this other detail which
is<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.320> been<00:02:24.320> incredible<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:26.650> going

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
is like just been incredible so going

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.400 
is like just been incredible so going
upwards<00:02:29.470> we're<00:02:30.470> looking<00:02:30.920> at<00:02:31.690> look<00:02:32.690> at<00:02:32.780> number

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
upwards we're looking at look at number

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.410 
upwards we're looking at look at number
17<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.390> then<00:02:35.540> oh<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.170> nephron<00:02:37.420> this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
17 and then oh this is the nephron this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.090 
17 and then oh this is the nephron this
is<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.989> functional<00:02:39.470> unit<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:41.209> kidney<00:02:42.100> you

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
is the functional unit of the kidney you

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.229 
is the functional unit of the kidney you
see<00:02:43.280> number<00:02:43.430> 17<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.120> pointing<00:02:44.920> towards<00:02:47.200> one

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
see number 17 is pointing towards one

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.550 
see number 17 is pointing towards one
specific<00:02:50.530> glomerulus<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.799> then<00:02:52.459> which<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.209> a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
specific glomerulus and then which is a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.400 
specific glomerulus and then which is a
actually<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> filtration<00:02:55.190> system<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.810> then

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
actually the filtration system and then

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.850 
actually the filtration system and then
here's<00:02:57.680> number<00:02:57.890> 17<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.730> side<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> look<00:03:00.739> at

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
here's number 17 on the side and look at

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.670 
here's number 17 on the side and look at
that<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.780> arrow<00:03:03.080> pointing

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
that that with the arrow pointing

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.780 
that that with the arrow pointing
downwards<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:05.180> red<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:07.160> very<00:03:07.519> small

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
downwards in the red is a very small

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.430 
downwards in the red is a very small
artery<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.250> blood<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.989> through<00:03:11.989> a

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
artery and then the blood is through a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.890 
artery and then the blood is through a
combination<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.640> see<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.000> holes<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.570> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
combination you see the holes and the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.220 
combination you see the holes and the
filtration<00:03:17.900> system<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:19.269> those<00:03:20.269> are<00:03:20.870> so

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
filtration system here those are so

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.670 
filtration system here those are so
small<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.790> has<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.209> ability<00:03:23.930> based<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
small it has the ability based on the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.280 
small it has the ability based on the
size<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.600> particular<00:03:26.900> chemical<00:03:27.680> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
size of the particular chemical to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.510 
size of the particular chemical to
filter<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.549> right<00:03:31.730> concentration

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
filter out in the right concentration

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.910 
filter out in the right concentration
the<00:03:34.520> chemicals<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.900> instance<00:03:36.200> electrolytes

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
the chemicals for instance electrolytes

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.090 
the chemicals for instance electrolytes
calcium<00:03:38.320> potassium<00:03:39.370> sodium<00:03:40.370> magnesium<00:03:41.150> and

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
keep those all in balance it also does

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.710 
keep those all in balance it also does
that<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:46.840> other<00:03:47.840> chemicals<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:49.360> end<00:03:50.360> up<00:03:50.570> on

your blood due to metabolism then coming
back<00:03:57.440> here<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:58.880> start<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.900> drainage<00:04:00.380> process

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
back here you start the drainage process

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.360 
back here you start the drainage process
if<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.550> look<00:04:01.730> very<00:04:01.760> carefully<00:04:02.980> down<00:04:03.980> at<00:04:04.280> the

combined end up feeding into the center
of<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.370> kidney<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.049> then<00:04:21.049> down<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.470> order

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
of the kidney and then down the order

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.110 
of the kidney and then down the order
and<00:04:22.040> out<00:04:23.830> down<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.190> bladder<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.730> then<00:04:26.480> you

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
and out down to the bladder and then you

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.360 
and out down to the bladder and then you
urinate<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.510> get<00:04:29.690> rid<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.070> those<00:04:31.070> waste

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
urinate and you get rid of those waste

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.520 
urinate and you get rid of those waste
products<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.530> over<00:04:33.530> here<00:04:33.700> is<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.990> larger

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
products and over here is a larger

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.800 
products and over here is a larger
version<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:39.470> nephron<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.510> you<00:04:41.510> actually

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
version of the nephron and you actually

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.740 
version of the nephron and you actually
see<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.979> in<00:04:43.130> red<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.800> arterial<00:04:45.800> segment

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
see here in red is the arterial segment

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.700 
see here in red is the arterial segment
which<00:04:47.890> combines<00:04:48.970> at<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.660> very<00:04:50.870> end<00:04:51.169> of<00:04:51.650> the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
which combines at the very end of the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.530 
which combines at the very end of the
arterial<00:04:52.370> system<00:04:53.380> with<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.650> venous<00:04:54.950> system

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
arterial system with the venous system

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.810 
arterial system with the venous system
and<00:04:56.540> then<00:04:56.870> one<00:04:57.080> once<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:57.820> filtration

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
and then one once that filtration

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.010 
and then one once that filtration
process<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.570> done<00:05:00.070> up<00:05:01.070> here<00:05:01.130> at<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.669> top

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.350 

again<00:05:04.770> that's<00:05:05.039> nephron<00:05:06.229> right<00:05:07.229> there<00:05:08.360> then

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
again that's nephron right there then

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.649 
again that's nephron right there then
you<00:05:09.629> can<00:05:09.810> follow<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.410> yellow<00:05:12.500> loops<00:05:13.500> around

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
you can follow the yellow loops around

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.290 
you can follow the yellow loops around
comes<00:05:15.659> back<00:05:15.780> up<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:18.120> gets<00:05:18.389> larger<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:20.300> there

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
comes back up and gets larger and there

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.450 
comes back up and gets larger and there
it<00:05:21.419> is<00:05:21.509> right<00:05:21.750> there<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.919> that<00:05:23.039> goes<00:05:23.220> into

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
it is right there and that goes into

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.629 
it is right there and that goes into
that<00:05:23.580> larger<00:05:23.940> tubulin<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.800> then<00:05:26.930> drains<00:05:27.930> down

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
that larger tubulin and then drains down

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.920 
that larger tubulin and then drains down
to<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.729> center<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> kidney<00:05:30.710> which<00:05:31.710> is

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
to the center of the kidney which is

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.589 
to the center of the kidney which is
again<00:05:33.930> right<00:05:34.139> there<00:05:34.349> and<00:05:35.030> then<00:05:36.030> all<00:05:36.300> of<00:05:36.330> the

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
again right there and then all of the

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.379 
again right there and then all of the
urine<00:05:36.900> combined<00:05:37.400> trains<00:05:38.400> into<00:05:38.759> the<00:05:38.849> order<00:05:39.210> and

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
urine combined trains into the order and

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.850 
urine combined trains into the order and
downs<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.139> bladder<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:43.680> the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
downs in the bladder so the and the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.029 
downs in the bladder so the and the
blood<00:05:44.099> flow<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.789> your<00:05:44.970> kidneys<00:05:45.509> is<00:05:46.039> phenomenal
