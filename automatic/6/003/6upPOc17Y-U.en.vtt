experience they were looking for because

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.310 
experience they were looking for because
if<00:03:30.850> you're<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.300> that<00:03:31.480> venue<00:03:31.750> when<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.140> were<00:03:32.230> up

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
if you're in that venue when you were up

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.660 
if you're in that venue when you were up
in<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.470> nosebleeds<00:03:33.040> you're<00:03:33.250> looking<00:03:33.459> at<00:03:33.550> the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
in the nosebleeds you're looking at the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.640 
in the nosebleeds you're looking at the
monitor<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.180> whole<00:03:34.360> time<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.110> think<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.620> lot

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
monitor the whole time so I think a lot

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620 
monitor the whole time so I think a lot
of<00:03:35.800> fans<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.490> know<00:03:36.580> they<00:03:36.730> really<00:03:36.970> need<00:03:37.330> some

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
of fans you know they really need some

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.330 
of fans you know they really need some
big<00:03:37.900> names<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.470> cards<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.950> get<00:03:39.070> them<00:03:39.190> excited

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
big names on cards to get them excited

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.070 
big names on cards to get them excited
to<00:03:39.670> go<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.060> venue<00:03:40.240> I<00:03:40.480> think<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.990> Air

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
to go to the venue I think the Air

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.230 
to go to the venue I think the Air
Canada<00:03:41.260> Centre<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.740> a<00:03:41.800> perfect<00:03:42.250> place<00:03:42.430> for<00:03:42.760> Jon

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
Canada Centre is a perfect place for Jon

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.810 
Canada Centre is a perfect place for Jon
Jones<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.870> Gustafson<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.220> interim

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
Jones and Gustafson and that interim

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.520 
Jones and Gustafson and that interim
bantamweight<00:03:45.940> title<00:03:46.360> fight<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.690> think<00:03:47.020> as<00:03:47.170> long

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
bantamweight title fight I think as long

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.040 
bantamweight title fight I think as long
as<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.800> stay<00:03:48.040> within<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.850> venue<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.390> holds<00:03:49.780> 20

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
as you stay within a venue that holds 20

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.770 
as you stay within a venue that holds 20
25<00:03:50.410> thousand<00:03:50.920> people<00:03:51.070> put<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:51.790> some<00:03:52.000> big<00:03:52.180> big

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
25 thousand people put on some big big

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
deep end really quick after two and a

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.960

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
I think if you're Dominick Cruz he would

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.690 
I think if you're Dominick Cruz he would
love<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.650> get<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.919> tune-up<00:04:21.250> fight<00:04:21.489> but

these guys are perfect training partners

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.840 
these guys are perfect training partners

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
so hopefully they can learn from each

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.060 
so hopefully they can learn from each
other<00:05:52.090> but<00:05:52.360> I<00:05:52.420> mean<00:05:52.840> Mike<00:05:53.380> Dolce<00:05:53.590> is<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.920> guy

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
other but I mean Mike Dolce is a guy

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.130 
other but I mean Mike Dolce is a guy
that<00:05:54.280> seems<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.970> get<00:05:55.120> anybody<00:05:55.480> down<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:56.110> a

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
that seems to get anybody down to a

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.260 
that seems to get anybody down to a
proper<00:05:56.590> weight<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:57.010> he<00:05:57.490> can<00:05:57.640> do<00:05:57.730> it<00:05:57.850> healthy

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
proper weight and he can do it healthy

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.540 
proper weight and he can do it healthy
so<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.840> think<00:05:58.990> if<00:05:59.320> Lombard<00:05:59.710> you<00:05:59.920> know<00:06:00.040> has<00:06:00.250> some

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.920 
so I think if Lombard you know has some
some<00:06:00.940> great<00:06:01.150> help<00:06:01.390> with<00:06:01.600> some<00:06:01.780> great
