00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the overlapped Corrigan seam and that's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.620

watertight reflective seal like that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.090 
watertight reflective seal like that
that's<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.270> poured<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.230> spread<00:02:52.620> right<00:02:52.890> over

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that using just a standard paint roller

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.510 
that using just a standard paint roller
so<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.050> how<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.260> do<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> metal<00:02:59.040> roof

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
so that's how you do a metal roof

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.630 
so that's how you do a metal roof
you'd<00:03:00.000> seam<00:03:00.390> tape<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.810> scenes<00:03:01.340> you'd<00:03:02.340> apply

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
you'd seam tape the scenes you'd apply

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.820 
you'd seam tape the scenes you'd apply
maximum<00:03:03.330> stretch<00:03:03.630> with<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.900> roller<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
maximum stretch with the roller and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.460 
maximum stretch with the roller and
allow<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> dry<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.270> your<00:03:06.570> seal<00:03:06.870> tight<00:03:07.290> as<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
allow it to dry and your seal tight as a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.760 
allow it to dry and your seal tight as a

fabric<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.900> have<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.080> roll<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.590> right<00:03:55.769> here

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
fabric to have a roll of it right here

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.850 
fabric to have a roll of it right here
comes<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.900> 42<00:03:58.380> inch<00:03:58.410> by<00:03:58.739> 75<00:03:59.370> foot<00:03:59.640> roll<00:04:00.860> and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
comes in a 42 inch by 75 foot roll and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.949 
comes in a 42 inch by 75 foot roll and
you<00:04:02.010> would<00:04:02.130> put<00:04:02.400> out<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.519> coat<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:03.180> our<00:04:03.330> elasto

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
you would put out a coat of our elasto

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.460 
you would put out a coat of our elasto
barrier<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:05.040> would<00:04:05.190> embed<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.840> fabric<00:04:07.260> right

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
barrier you would embed the fabric right

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.920 
barrier you would embed the fabric right
into<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.860> wet<00:04:08.070> Alaska<00:04:08.700> barrier<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.540> then

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
into the wet Alaska barrier and then

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.930 
into the wet Alaska barrier and then
pour<00:04:10.230> more<00:04:10.530> elastic<00:04:11.070> barrier<00:04:11.370> over<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.730> top

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
pour more elastic barrier over the top

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.770 
pour more elastic barrier over the top
which<00:04:12.209> would<00:04:12.420> give<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:14.269> reinforced<00:04:15.269> system

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
which would give you a reinforced system

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.449 
which would give you a reinforced system
so<00:04:15.989> you've<00:04:16.109> got<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.470> Alaska<00:04:16.950> barrier<00:04:17.250> base

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
so you've got the Alaska barrier base

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.920 
so you've got the Alaska barrier base
coat<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.329> fabric<00:04:18.840> more<00:04:19.500> last<00:04:19.799> barrier

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
coat the fabric more last barrier

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.430 
coat the fabric more last barrier
and<00:04:21.350> then<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.940> maximum<00:04:23.419> stretch<00:04:23.780> coating<00:04:24.290> on

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
and then the maximum stretch coating on

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.460 
and then the maximum stretch coating on
top<00:04:24.759> so<00:04:25.759> maximum<00:04:26.210> stretch<00:04:26.449> works<00:04:26.780> alone<00:04:27.229> by

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
top so maximum stretch works alone by

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.890 
top so maximum stretch works alone by
itself<00:04:27.889> or<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.669> can<00:04:29.000> be<00:04:29.210> used<00:04:29.449> in<00:04:29.720> conjunction

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
itself or it can be used in conjunction

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.249 
itself or it can be used in conjunction
with<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:31.100> contouring<00:04:31.729> real<00:04:31.970> fabric<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.840> the

with the contouring real fabric and the

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.010 
with the contouring real fabric and the
elasto<00:04:33.770> barrier<00:04:34.100> base<00:04:34.400> coat<00:04:34.759> the<00:04:35.720> last

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
low sloped roofs it's just like a

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.920 
low sloped roofs it's just like a

bicycle or a tire in a tube what we do

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.610 
bicycle or a tire in a tube what we do
there<00:05:00.229> is<00:05:00.260> we<00:05:00.970> need<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.120> stick<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.600> EPDM<00:05:03.229> so

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
there is we need to stick to EPDM so

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.290 
there is we need to stick to EPDM so
there's<00:05:03.830> an<00:05:03.949> item<00:05:04.250> called<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.789> product

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
there's an item called the product

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.300 
there's an item called the product
called<00:05:05.479> super<00:05:05.570> primer<00:05:06.410> we've<00:05:06.860> applied<00:05:07.250> that

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
called super primer we've applied that

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.520 
called super primer we've applied that
here<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:07.910> that's<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.150> bonding<00:05:08.630> agent<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:09.410> we

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
here and that's a bonding agent so we

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.790 
here and that's a bonding agent so we
apply<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.919> super<00:05:10.400> primer<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.120> EPDM<00:05:11.800> allow

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
apply the super primer to the EPDM allow

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.480 
apply the super primer to the EPDM allow
it<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.099> dry<00:05:13.370> which<00:05:13.849> takes<00:05:14.150> about<00:05:14.270> 15<00:05:14.990> minutes

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
it to dry which takes about 15 minutes

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
once that's dry to the touch it dries

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.400 
once that's dry to the touch it dries
slightly<00:05:18.590> tacky<00:05:19.210> then<00:05:20.210> we<00:05:20.389> just<00:05:20.630> pour<00:05:21.020> out<00:05:21.229> and

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
slightly tacky then we just pour out and

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.040 
slightly tacky then we just pour out and
spread<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.460> maximum<00:05:22.970> stretch<00:05:23.270> coating

over the top of the super primer and

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.710 
over the top of the super primer and
that<00:05:27.650> seals<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.280> roof<00:05:28.550> up<00:05:28.760> that'll<00:05:29.330> seal<00:05:29.570> an

that if you have any seams in the epgm
yeah<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.090> we're<00:05:41.210> gonna<00:05:41.300> use<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:42.229> seam<00:05:42.470> tape

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
yeah and we're gonna use the seam tape

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.399 
yeah and we're gonna use the seam tape
we'd<00:05:45.800> have<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:45.949> seam<00:05:46.400> like<00:05:46.669> this<00:05:47.199> simply<00:05:48.199> put

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
we'd have a seam like this simply put

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.080 
we'd have a seam like this simply put
