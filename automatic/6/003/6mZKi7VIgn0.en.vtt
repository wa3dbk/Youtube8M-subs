00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.039
 if one day you want to hurt 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.119
 someone but really really 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.210
 really make him suffer 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.830
 have him work this exercise the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.419
 nature is to the screen and I'm going 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.770
 show you what we'll do we'll 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.110
 have the three fingers major index finger 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.599
 annular pose in case at 5.6 is on the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.640
 Rope better that we will play a of pool 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.529
 with the little finger in class since the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.610
 break fast so we scratch at 4.8 all 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.960
 up there by box 7 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.219
 just try to see to see 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.930
 will see that it is hard to do 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.850
 neatly with a note that rings 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.870
 clearly and do it in rhythm there 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.290
 will have like doing it close up for 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.290
 see what it gives 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.540
 and 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.910
 then you have tried that you have 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.020
 suffered I suppose so yeah the little 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.880
 must be very very weak 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.380
 especially because he has no 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.610
 independence or almost compared to 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.100
 the ring finger so when we want to move 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.050
 one without moving the other is hard hard 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.430
 hard hard hard 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.810
 this exercise alone is going to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.550
 represent the bulk of your 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.900
 work on chickens off because the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.650
 day when you will need to do it and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 you will need it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 well you better be interested in being 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380
 to see her working well we're just going 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 spent close up to do it a 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 second time a little faster 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.490
 because I like to throw 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550
 little challenge like that so let's do 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550
 the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.250
 with the examples I 'm going to show if 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.570
 you have tried it you feel 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.500
 maybe as a handicap and you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.630
 can not move the little finger anymore 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 we do not understand what is happening 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.160
 a little bit back at the age of 2 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.300
 what two and a half the myth 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.830
 yeah but that's normal worry 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.090
 not it will come with time all the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.550
 world is able to work that it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 just have to do it slowly does the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.730
 30 seconds or minutes every day and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 you will see that you have no time 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.880
 will get to do it a lot better and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.500
 more and more quickly and in a few 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.750
 month you will have completely forgotten 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.130
 this difficulty 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.150
 despite everything he goes out to conclude this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.700
 series of exercises we will move to 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.020
 eighth and last exercise for bat 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.820
 to work a little bit more 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.580
 it's still going to take 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.890
 a chromatic exercise and here we go 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.090
 start with the box eight strings 2000 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.590
 sharp as you can see on the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.450
 tablature and after we will have to make a 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.310
 chicken by box 7 then to box 6 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990
 then to the case 500 hand-retouched 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.710
 right one scratches the first note and the 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.710
 others did everything we did
