remove the steam chest cover to have a

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.710 
remove the steam chest cover to have a
look<00:00:09.100> at<00:00:09.190> the<00:00:09.280> valve<00:00:09.490> inside<00:00:09.940> the<00:00:10.120> steam<00:00:10.390> chest

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720 
look at the valve inside the steam chest

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.050 
look at the valve inside the steam chest
the<00:00:11.410> valve<00:00:11.680> events<00:00:12.190> are<00:00:12.340> not<00:00:12.490> right<00:00:12.730> on<00:00:12.760> this

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.060 
the valve events are not right on this

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.730 
the valve events are not right on this
engine<00:00:13.269> not<00:00:13.780> right<00:00:13.990> at<00:00:14.230> all

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
engine not right at all

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.100 
engine not right at all
one<00:00:15.460> of<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.700> problems<00:00:16.029> is<00:00:16.240> a<00:00:16.299> lot<00:00:16.630> of<00:00:16.810> slop<00:00:17.080> and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
one of the problems is a lot of slop and

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.560 
one of the problems is a lot of slop and
play<00:00:17.470> in<00:00:17.710> the<00:00:17.830> valve<00:00:18.010> linkage<00:00:18.490> but<00:00:19.210> it's<00:00:19.390> not

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
play in the valve linkage but it's not

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.140 
play in the valve linkage but it's not
just<00:00:19.750> that<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.230> timing<00:00:20.500> is<00:00:20.770> radically<00:00:21.340> out<00:00:21.490> so

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
just that the timing is radically out so

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.880 
just that the timing is radically out so
I'm<00:00:22.240> going<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.449> have<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.570> quick<00:00:22.840> look<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.260> see

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
I'm going to have a quick look and see

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.890 
I'm going to have a quick look and see
where<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.279> valve<00:00:24.520> is<00:00:24.670> actually<00:00:25.029> set<00:00:25.330> in<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
where the valve is actually set in the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.160 
where the valve is actually set in the
valve<00:00:26.110> chest<00:00:26.440> and<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.390> first<00:00:28.630> thing<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.840> do<00:00:29.050> is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
valve chest and the first thing to do is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.950 
valve chest and the first thing to do is
to<00:00:29.289> remove<00:00:29.560> all<00:00:29.800> these<00:00:30.010> 8ba<00:00:30.490> nuts<00:00:30.880> these<00:00:31.779> are

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
to remove all these 8ba nuts these are

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.899 
to remove all these 8ba nuts these are
very<00:00:32.140> small<00:00:32.439> and<00:00:32.739> easily<00:00:32.920> lost<00:00:33.339> so<00:00:33.519> it's<00:00:33.699> quite

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:33.909 
very small and easily lost so it's quite

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.910 
very small and easily lost so it's quite
important<00:00:34.510> to<00:00:34.629> find<00:00:34.839> a<00:00:34.929> suitable<00:00:35.170> box<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.769> put

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
important to find a suitable box to put

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.420 
important to find a suitable box to put
them<00:00:36.100> in

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
them in

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.670 
them in
the<00:00:38.060> valve<00:00:38.270> chest<00:00:38.570> cover<00:00:38.840> comes<00:00:39.110> away<00:00:39.380> quite

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
the valve chest cover comes away quite

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.920 
the valve chest cover comes away quite
easily<00:00:40.340> there<00:00:41.030> isn't<00:00:41.150> a<00:00:41.360> gasket<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:41.900> place

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
easily there isn't a gasket in place

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.140 
easily there isn't a gasket in place
this<00:00:42.500> engine<00:00:42.860> is<00:00:42.950> very<00:00:43.010> well<00:00:43.400> made<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:43.850> things

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
this engine is very well made and things

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.709 
this engine is very well made and things
do<00:00:44.360> fit<00:00:44.600> together<00:00:44.930> quite<00:00:45.110> well

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
do fit together quite well

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.540 
do fit together quite well
the<00:00:47.230> slide<00:00:47.500> valve<00:00:47.710> appears<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.250> be<00:00:48.340> completely

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
the slide valve appears to be completely

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.509 
the slide valve appears to be completely
in<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.210> wrong<00:00:49.390> place<00:00:49.719> it<00:00:50.469> only<00:00:50.710> uncovers<00:00:51.340> one

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
in the wrong place it only uncovers one

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.329 
in the wrong place it only uncovers one
of<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.730> steam<00:00:51.969> pods<00:00:52.739> once<00:00:53.739> I<00:00:53.860> removed<00:00:54.160> the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
of the steam pods once I removed the

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.399 
of the steam pods once I removed the
valve<00:00:54.519> link<00:00:54.910> rod<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.510> could<00:00:56.019> see<00:00:56.199> there<00:00:56.350> was

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
valve link rod I could see there was

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.619 
valve link rod I could see there was
plenty<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.890> play<00:00:57.159> on<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.610> shaft<00:00:57.909> with<00:00:58.449> this

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
plenty of play on the shaft with this

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.380 
plenty of play on the shaft with this
upright<00:00:59.019> arm<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.640> I<00:01:00.699> thought<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.059> was<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.180> good

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
upright arm so I thought it was a good

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.930 
upright arm so I thought it was a good
idea<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:02.079> remove<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.559> bearing<00:01:02.860> caps<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.370> take

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
idea to remove the bearing caps and take

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.820 
idea to remove the bearing caps and take
out<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.299> assembly<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.869> fix<00:01:05.080> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 

each<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.000> bearing<00:01:09.480> caps<00:01:09.690> are<00:01:09.870> held<00:01:10.050> in

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
each of these bearing caps are held in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
each of these bearing caps are held in
place<00:01:10.260> by<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.740> pair<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> bolts<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.760> once<00:01:12.630> will

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
place by a pair of bolts I once will

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
place by a pair of bolts I once will
remove<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> bolts<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:13.620> thought<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.190> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
remove the bolts I thought it would be a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.240 
remove the bolts I thought it would be a
good<00:01:14.400> idea<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:15.180> clean<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> top<00:01:15.930> face<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
good idea to clean up the top face as it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.149 
good idea to clean up the top face as it
was<00:01:17.340> quite<00:01:17.580> tarnished<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.300> dirty

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
was quite tarnished and dirty

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
was quite tarnished and dirty
an<00:01:20.610> easy<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> fine<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.899> is<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
an easy way of fine to do this is to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.620 
an easy way of fine to do this is to
just<00:01:22.560> use<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> piece<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> 800<00:01:23.939> grade<00:01:24.180> wet<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.570> dry

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
just use a piece of 800 grade wet or dry

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.920 
just use a piece of 800 grade wet or dry
sandpaper<00:01:25.079> on<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.920> metal<00:01:26.369> block<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.600> doesn't

sandpaper on a metal block it doesn't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
sandpaper on a metal block it doesn't
need<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.320> proper<00:01:28.680> surface<00:01:29.100> plate<00:01:29.340> for

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
need to be a proper surface plate for

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.639 
need to be a proper surface plate for
this<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.450> piece<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> steel<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.439> as

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
this just a piece of steel will do as

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.930 
this just a piece of steel will do as
long<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.430> flat

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.850

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
on this piece of sandpaper you would

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.120 
on this piece of sandpaper you would
eventually<00:01:38.930> get<00:01:39.320> quite<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.620> good<00:01:39.740> surface

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
eventually get quite a good surface

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.520 
eventually get quite a good surface

you<00:01:44.900> get<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> really<00:01:45.440> nice<00:01:45.680> finish

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
you get a really nice finish

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.749 
you get a really nice finish
here<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.590> see<00:01:48.799> me<00:01:48.920> taking<00:01:49.159> off<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.610> other

special<00:02:19.299> box<00:02:19.540> spanner<00:02:19.870> handy<00:02:20.439> I<00:02:20.469> removed<00:02:21.189> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
special box spanner handy I removed the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.059 
special box spanner handy I removed the
exhaust<00:02:21.730> manifold<00:02:22.299> this<00:02:23.170> was<00:02:23.379> over<00:02:23.680> painted

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
exhaust manifold this was over painted

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.039 
exhaust manifold this was over painted
and<00:02:24.219> didn't<00:02:24.489> look<00:02:24.579> very<00:02:24.760> good<00:02:24.909> what<00:02:25.749> I'm<00:02:25.870> going

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
and didn't look very good what I'm going

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.229 
and didn't look very good what I'm going
to<00:02:26.109> do<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.349> remove<00:02:26.499> the<00:02:26.799> paint<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.310> polish<00:02:27.939> up

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
to do is remove the paint and polish up

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.590 
to do is remove the paint and polish up
the<00:02:28.389> part

the part

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.870 
the part
then<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.170> remove<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.740> valve<00:02:31.920> rod<00:02:32.190> lever<00:02:32.460> this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
then I remove the valve rod lever this

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
then I remove the valve rod lever this
was<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> simple<00:02:33.540> job

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
was a simple job

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.110 
was a simple job
I<00:02:33.930> simply<00:02:34.290> knocked<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.920> pin<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.970> whole

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I simply knocked out the pin the whole

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.030 
I simply knocked out the pin the whole
thing<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.870> sloppy<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.860> when<00:02:38.010> I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
thing is a little bit sloppy so when I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.770 
thing is a little bit sloppy so when I
put<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.400> back<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.580> I'll<00:02:38.970> probably<00:02:39.210> put<00:02:39.390> Elmo

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
put it back on I'll probably put Elmo

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.500 
put it back on I'll probably put Elmo
some<00:02:39.990> Loctite<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> moment<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
some Loctite but for the moment it is

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.800 
some Loctite but for the moment it is
time<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.930> clean<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.610> when<00:02:44.610> using<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.180> 800

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
time to clean it up when using the 800

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380 
time to clean it up when using the 800
wet<00:02:45.990> or<00:02:46.170> dry<00:02:46.230> sandpaper<00:02:46.800> method<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.060> parts

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
wet or dry sandpaper method if the parts

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.480 
wet or dry sandpaper method if the parts
are<00:02:48.540> steel<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.080> recommend<00:02:49.680> using<00:02:49.920> some<00:02:50.280> oil

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
are steel I recommend using some oil

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.820 
are steel I recommend using some oil
this<00:02:51.420> will<00:02:51.630> stop<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.960> metal<00:02:52.230> from<00:02:52.410> dragging

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
this will stop the metal from dragging

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.920 
this will stop the metal from dragging
brass<00:02:53.730> seems<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.270> fairly<00:02:54.540> self

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
brass seems to be fairly self

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.860 
brass seems to be fairly self
lubricating<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:56.370> steel<00:02:56.700> isn't<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.330> get

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
lubricating but steel isn't and you get

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.740 
lubricating but steel isn't and you get
a<00:02:57.900> better<00:02:58.140> finish<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.710> way<00:02:59.390> this<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.570> very

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
a better finish this way this is very

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.080 
a better finish this way this is very
messy<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.140> time-consuming<00:03:01.500> but<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.430> worth<00:03:02.670> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
messy and time-consuming but is worth it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.300 
messy and time-consuming but is worth it
I<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.440> put<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.830> part<00:03:05.040> on<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
I don't just want to put the part on a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.830 
I don't just want to put the part on a
polishing<00:03:05.700> spindle<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> will

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
polishing spindle because that will

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.560 
polishing spindle because that will
round<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.350> edges<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.460> can<00:03:08.610> see<00:03:08.670> it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
round the edges and as you can see it

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.610 
round the edges and as you can see it
looks<00:03:09.810> quite<00:03:10.080> nice<00:03:10.320> now

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
looks quite nice now

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.710 
looks quite nice now
I<00:03:11.680> removed<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.459> top<00:03:12.730> caps<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.299> bearings

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
I removed the top caps of the bearings

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.360 
I removed the top caps of the bearings
in<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> first<00:03:14.230> place<00:03:14.500> because<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.069> thought

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
in the first place because I thought

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.250 
in the first place because I thought
that<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.000> whole<00:03:16.030> assembly<00:03:16.720> would<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:17.019> able<00:03:17.080> to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
that the whole assembly would be able to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.080 
that the whole assembly would be able to
be<00:03:17.349> withdrawn<00:03:17.920> from<00:03:18.159> underneath<00:03:18.819> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
be withdrawn from underneath the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.600 
be withdrawn from underneath the
cylinder<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.620> was<00:03:20.739> actually<00:03:20.920> wrong<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
cylinder but it was actually wrong I

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.520 
cylinder but it was actually wrong I
would<00:03:22.269> have<00:03:22.299> had<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.690> remove<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.200> cylinder

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
would have had to remove the cylinder

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.080 
would have had to remove the cylinder
itself<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.159> do<00:03:24.280> that

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
itself to do that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.940 
itself to do that
as<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.720> turned<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.349> didn't<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:27.709> need

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
as it turned out it didn't really need

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.949 
as it turned out it didn't really need
removing<00:03:28.489> anyway<00:03:28.849> because<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.629> parts

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
removing anyway because the parts

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.350 
removing anyway because the parts
underneath<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.560> cylinder<00:03:31.010> are<00:03:31.580> very<00:03:31.879> solidly

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
underneath the cylinder are very solidly

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.770 
underneath the cylinder are very solidly
and<00:03:32.660> firmly<00:03:32.959> attached<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.800> shaft<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:35.569> was

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
and firmly attached to the shaft it was

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.300 
and firmly attached to the shaft it was
only<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.200> arm<00:03:36.349> at<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.650> end<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.099> shaft

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
only the arm at the end of the shaft

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.420 
only the arm at the end of the shaft
that<00:03:37.640> was<00:03:37.730> actually<00:03:38.120> loose<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.920> I'll<00:03:40.099> replace

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
that was actually loose but I'll replace

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.640 
that was actually loose but I'll replace
the<00:03:40.610> bearing<00:03:40.940> caps<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.959> adjusted<00:03:42.440> them

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the bearing caps and I adjusted them

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740 
the bearing caps and I adjusted them
making<00:03:43.340> sure<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.879> top<00:03:44.090> caps<00:03:44.360> were<00:03:44.540> not

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
making sure that the top caps were not

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.259 
making sure that the top caps were not
over<00:03:45.110> tightened<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.680> distort<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.220> bearing<00:03:46.670> so

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
over tightened to distort the bearing so

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.690 
over tightened to distort the bearing so
the<00:03:47.510> whole<00:03:47.720> assembly<00:03:48.319> move<00:03:48.739> very<00:03:49.040> freely

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
the whole assembly move very freely

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
once the bearing caps were in place I

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.780 
once the bearing caps were in place I
put<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.850> spot<00:03:54.240> of<00:03:54.390> oil<00:03:54.569> on<00:03:54.720> each<00:03:54.840> bearing<00:03:55.319> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
put a spot of oil on each bearing and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.309 
put a spot of oil on each bearing and
the<00:03:56.790> whole<00:03:56.940> thing<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.240> very<00:03:57.510> free<00:03:57.900> with<00:03:58.290> no

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319
