00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060 
enjoyed it i gave it an a-minus without
it<00:00:26.910> was<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.420> well-rounded<00:00:27.930> movie<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it was a really well-rounded movie the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
it was a really well-rounded movie the
villain<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.359> sucky<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.040> my

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
villain was pretty sucky and that was my

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.610 
villain was pretty sucky and that was my
main<00:00:32.489> issue<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> movie<00:00:33.510> unlike<00:00:34.170> man<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
main issue with the movie unlike man of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350 
main issue with the movie unlike man of
steel<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.190> still<00:00:35.579> feel<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> Viper<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
steel I still feel the Viper is a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110 
steel I still feel the Viper is a
terrible<00:00:36.809> villain<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.430> changing

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
terrible villain so that's not changing

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
terrible villain so that's not changing
but<00:00:39.390> overall<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> thought<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> extended

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
but overall I thought that the extended

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
but overall I thought that the extended
edition<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> The<00:00:42.149> Wolverine<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:43.110> added<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
edition of The Wolverine really added to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
edition of The Wolverine really added to
it<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.950> small<00:00:44.489> amount<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> time<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.090> had

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it in the small amount of time that had

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.200 
it in the small amount of time that had
actually<00:00:45.510> gained<00:00:46.170> cuz<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:47.070> movie<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.700> felt

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
actually gained cuz this movie just felt

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
actually gained cuz this movie just felt
it<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:49.140> already<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> well-rounded<00:00:49.800> movie

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it was already a well-rounded movie

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.680 
it was already a well-rounded movie
aside<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> villain<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
aside from the villain but now it just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.560 
aside from the villain but now it just
it<00:00:52.110> felt<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.920> well-rounded<00:00:53.460> than<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> was

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it felt more well-rounded than it was

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
it felt more well-rounded than it was
because<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.039> characters<00:00:56.309> there's<00:00:56.879> more

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
because the characters there's more

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
because the characters there's more

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
there was much like most of it was the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.680 
there was much like most of it was the
fight<00:04:46.370> scenes<00:04:46.700> in<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.090> middle<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.540> movie

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
fight scenes in the middle of the movie

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.690 
fight scenes in the middle of the movie
and<00:04:47.900> developing<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.950> characters<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.460> wasn't

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
and developing the characters it wasn't

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.490 
and developing the characters it wasn't
really<00:04:49.880> adding<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.450> final<00:04:50.810> sequence<00:04:51.230> of

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
really adding to the final sequence of

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.470 
really adding to the final sequence of
the<00:04:51.560> movie<00:04:51.800> or<00:04:51.920> anything<00:04:51.950> like<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:52.790> i

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
the movie or anything like that so i

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.940 
the movie or anything like that so i
didn't<00:04:53.750> mind<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:54.110> cuz<00:04:54.350> i<00:04:54.440> still<00:04:54.680> thought<00:04:54.800> the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
didn't mind that cuz i still thought the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.110 
didn't mind that cuz i still thought the
final<00:04:55.250> sequence<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.760> movie<00:04:55.970> was

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
final sequence of the movie was

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.600 
final sequence of the movie was
enjoyable<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.830> rest<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.190> action<00:04:58.520> the

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
enjoyable it the rest of the action the

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.280 
enjoyable it the rest of the action the
movie<00:04:58.820> was<00:04:58.940> actually<00:04:59.270> better<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.630> be<00:04:59.900> honest

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
movie was actually better to be honest

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
she's just not an interesting character

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.080 
she's just not an interesting character
she's<00:05:06.470> actually<00:05:06.770> kind<00:05:07.370> of<00:05:07.490> interesting<00:05:07.670> in

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
she's actually kind of interesting in

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.430 
she's actually kind of interesting in
the<00:05:08.180> way<00:05:08.210> her<00:05:08.420> powers<00:05:08.780> are<00:05:08.870> set<00:05:09.110> up<00:05:09.200> I'm<00:05:09.320> gonna

that<00:05:11.240> she<00:05:11.480> could<00:05:11.780> have<00:05:11.900> been<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:12.140> good<00:05:12.590> villain

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
that she could have been a good villain

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.060

a<00:05:45.290> type<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.160> humor<00:05:46.850> behind<00:05:47.150> his<00:05:47.780> what<00:05:48.110> he<00:05:48.230> does

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
a type of humor behind his what he does

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.840 
a type of humor behind his what he does
usually<00:05:48.940> it's<00:05:49.940> usually<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:50.330> dark<00:05:50.840> humor<00:05:51.320> and

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
usually it's usually a dark humor and

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.820 
usually it's usually a dark humor and
filled<00:05:52.850> with<00:05:52.940> hate<00:05:53.270> but<00:05:53.300> it's<00:05:53.960> still<00:05:54.410> funny

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
filled with hate but it's still funny

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.830 
filled with hate but it's still funny
like<00:05:55.310> manna<00:05:55.550> steal<00:05:55.850> tried<00:05:56.240> for<00:05:56.450> humor<00:05:56.720> and

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
like manna steal tried for humor and

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.900 
like manna steal tried for humor and
failed<00:05:57.080> miserably<00:05:57.200> this<00:05:57.860> movie<00:05:58.190> it<00:05:58.430> knows

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
failed miserably this movie it knows

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.700 
failed miserably this movie it knows
when<00:05:59.330> to<00:05:59.360> use<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.960> humor<00:06:00.320> in<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.530> right

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
when to use the humor in the right

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.260 
when to use the humor in the right
moments<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:01.280> it<00:06:01.370> works<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.910> I<00:06:01.970> like<00:06:02.240> that

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
moments and it works and I like that

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.360 
moments and it works and I like that
about<00:06:02.480> the<00:06:02.810> movie<00:06:03.080> overall<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.830> Wolverine

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
about the movie overall the Wolverine

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.370 
about the movie overall the Wolverine
extended<00:06:05.030> edition<00:06:05.419> I<00:06:05.540> like<00:06:05.720> it<00:06:05.870> more<00:06:06.050> than<00:06:06.110> the

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
extended edition I like it more than the

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.080 
extended edition I like it more than the
theatrical<00:06:07.010> cut<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.220> think<00:06:07.460> it<00:06:07.550> just<00:06:07.580> adds<00:06:07.850> to

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
theatrical cut I think it just adds to

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.760 
theatrical cut I think it just adds to
the<00:06:08.270> movie<00:06:08.540> more<00:06:08.720> it<00:06:08.810> gets<00:06:08.930> more<00:06:09.169> development

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
the movie more it gets more development

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.620 
the movie more it gets more development
in<00:06:09.860> there<00:06:10.010> it's<00:06:10.190> more<00:06:10.430> enjoyable<00:06:10.730> as<00:06:11.180> a<00:06:11.210> whole

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
in there it's more enjoyable as a whole

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.420 
in there it's more enjoyable as a whole
I<00:06:11.870> think<00:06:12.140> if<00:06:12.230> you<00:06:12.350> like<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.710> Wolverine<00:06:13.130> you'll

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
I think if you like the Wolverine you'll

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.330 
I think if you like the Wolverine you'll
like<00:06:13.730> this<00:06:13.970> even<00:06:14.330> more<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:15.050> you<00:06:15.919> have<00:06:16.070> to<00:06:16.190> pick

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
like this even more and you have to pick

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.430 
like this even more and you have to pick
up<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.700> 3d<00:06:17.330> edition<00:06:17.900> though<00:06:18.020> because<00:06:18.169> that's

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
up the 3d edition though because that's

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.290 
up the 3d edition though because that's
one<00:06:18.890> of<00:06:18.980> the<00:06:19.040> things<00:06:19.100> they<00:06:19.430> had<00:06:19.640> it<00:06:19.940> you<00:06:20.180> have

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
one of the things they had it you have

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.820 
one of the things they had it you have
to<00:06:20.390> pick<00:06:20.510> up<00:06:20.600> the<00:06:20.630> 3d<00:06:21.050> addition<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:21.560> get<00:06:21.710> the
