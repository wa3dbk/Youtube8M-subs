00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.190
 chaos 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.040
 it's everyone from archaos geof 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.529
 find for a new video of 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.689
 blick ch the blackhawks 2 to zombie mode 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.700
 in the same bend to achieve 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.110
 sleeves to infinity halter patch so 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.270
 to start the blick ch you go 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.520
 have to create the thruster once 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.710
 you have the propeller and preferably 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.420
 of sliti girl catr you are going you 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.300
 where I ended up in the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.059
 nonque video that's where the elevator is 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.220
 broken where there is a lot of debris you 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.930
 go down to the second floor I 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.760
 believe finally I think I'm going a little 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.070
 all are known where is the glitch 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.900
 you'll just have to place your 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.909
 propeller as I liked in the video 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.040
 which will be more difficult room because 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.960
 the thruster projects pretty badly so 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.360
 once the thruster is well placed and the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.190
 propeller loaded you just have to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.020
 is behind the wall is normally 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.880
 their little booster propellants 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.070
 who's over and you just have to go 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.570
 on top and will make you well breche the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.400
 wall so once in the wall 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.740
 normally you will be purely a target 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 and the zombies will come all those 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.990
 blocked against you so like serge 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.910
 guichard to Sunday we finished you'll have 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.950
 just attract one or two balls and the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.370
 round will end because in some 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.680
 kind 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.330
 where you are is the spawn of 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.830
 zombies because in fact he has two 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.350
 windows that are right next to you 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.060
 help her bi come out both 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.680
 worlds one at the time that comes out and the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.140
 sleeves are at very very very 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 quickly and we ball is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.030
 finished I also advise you the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.840
 remington 3 that's called like that it's 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.370
 the shotgun 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.730
 I advise you to improve it by 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.770
 those who the one shot the gollum and thanks 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730
 to that and my you can unlock 1 to 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.560
 all for free 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.090
 so to get out of the glitch you have 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.710
 just to you m crouching as I'm going on 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.030
 show more clearly in the video and 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.840
 after you will be outside so it's a 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.850
 super glee ch 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.489
 this box come in and out when 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.950
 you want more it's difficult 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.260
 because the propeller sometimes when he 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.840
 emanates neither and well you go the brief 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.519
 normally but except in gap veil 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.620
 and you're stuck in the wall 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.540
 but you see a little while gray you 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.190
 do not really see very far from the map 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.170
 it means that you have pain and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.269
 realize the blick because when you 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.340
 are in the wall normally you go 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.780
 see everywhere we sleep on the map 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 you will have seen at the beginning of the video 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.519
 that had bug vision bugs 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.530
 and textured mavericks appliances will 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.569
 that you really see everywhere in gold 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.269
 the map otherwise the glitch will work 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.099
 not finally it's a little tutorial for you 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.840
 because I still struggled with 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.760
 bienne realize because I would like 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.610
 it so that the propeller is placed 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.500
 to the nearest millimeter then will take about 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.840
 10 15 minutes to realize it for the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.670
 first time but after that comes true 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.260
 very easily and very quickly 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.730
 so I hope this video of 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.380
 glee that I have enjoyed you as I would 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.810
 could see really do some sleeves to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.400
 infinity pay attention because there 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.470
 risks of being removed from 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.140
 ranking it's just that if you 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.970
 go over the sleeve without we will say eh 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.640
 ben you will be removed from the ranking 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.560
 but you will keep your level and your 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.170
 what you will have done in the game 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.299
 so I'm telling you very soon for 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.190
 next videos like a blue see my 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.239
 annif lowy a true and click at the same 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.950
 time that I did mine 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.470
 and so here I will do later a 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.390
 video to show you how to stay 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.920
 blocked whose toboggan several times 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.239
 like that and I'll see you soon 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.450
 for future videos and chats all
