00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
that I think that is the intention to so

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.949 
that I think that is the intention to so
it's<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.130> yeah<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:51.209> that's<00:02:51.450> hard<00:02:51.660> that's<00:02:51.750> why

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
it's a yeah like that's hard that's why

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.780 
it's a yeah like that's hard that's why
it's<00:02:52.079> hard<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> rate<00:02:53.130> stuff<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.610> this

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
it's hard for me to rate stuff like this

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
it's hard for me to rate stuff like this
is<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:55.079> hard<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.440> comment<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
is because it's hard to comment on the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.910 
is because it's hard to comment on the
flavor<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:58.170> me<00:02:58.200> beers<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:58.769> this
