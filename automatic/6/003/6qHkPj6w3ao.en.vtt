00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
live in Aberystwyth and I did a lot of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.010 
live in Aberystwyth and I did a lot of
mountain<00:01:11.310> biking<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.510> area<00:01:12.900> and

mountain biking in all of that area and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
mountain biking in all of that area and
even<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> road<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
even then I look to that road and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
even then I look to that road and
thought<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.780> great<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.200> road

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

mountain<00:01:18.360> bike<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> again<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> idea<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
mountain bike so again the idea of a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.770
