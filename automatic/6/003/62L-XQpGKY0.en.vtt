00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:01.380 
account linked so you can only link one
account<00:02:56.860> let's<00:02:57.860> try<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.250> now

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.090 

got<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:02.720> right<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.740> just<00:03:03.770> learned

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
got it all right so we just learned

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.230 
got it all right so we just learned
something<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.520> can<00:03:04.640> only<00:03:04.670> like<00:03:04.910> one<00:03:05.060> account

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
something you can only like one account

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.100 
something you can only like one account
all<00:03:05.780> right

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
all right

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.780 
all right
and<00:03:06.350> once<00:03:06.860> you've<00:03:07.040> linked<00:03:07.340> your<00:03:07.400> account

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
and once you've linked your account

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.690 
and once you've linked your account
you're<00:03:08.360> going<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.900> get<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:10.990> little<00:03:11.990> icon<00:03:12.700> to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
you're going to get a little icon to

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.030 
you're going to get a little icon to
disable<00:03:14.150> my<00:03:14.630> face<00:03:14.900> here<00:03:15.170> for<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> second<00:03:15.830> just

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
disable my face here for a second just

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.110 
disable my face here for a second just
so<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.220> guys<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.400> see<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.620> say

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
so you guys can see it's going to say

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.440 
so you guys can see it's going to say
hello<00:03:20.120> okay<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:21.370> say<00:03:22.370> set<00:03:22.760> up<00:03:22.880> your<00:03:23.000> broadcast

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
hello okay I say set up your broadcast

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.150 
hello okay I say set up your broadcast
and<00:03:23.810> then<00:03:23.960> you're<00:03:24.110> gonna<00:03:24.200> click<00:03:24.530> start<00:03:24.830> all

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
and then you're gonna click start all

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.860 
and then you're gonna click start all
right<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:26.420> let's<00:03:26.660> click<00:03:26.990> Next

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.900 

so<00:03:32.870> once<00:03:33.530> you're<00:03:33.680> on<00:03:33.710> there<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.520> gonna<00:03:34.640> say

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
so once you're on there it's gonna say

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.840 
so once you're on there it's gonna say

change the broadcast title and your

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.199 
change the broadcast title and your
quality<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:07.680> HD<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.280> probably<00:04:08.670> want<00:04:09.000> at

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
quality for HD you probably want at

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.080 
quality for HD you probably want at
least<00:04:09.440> 2000<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.620> 2500<00:04:11.010> kilobits<00:04:11.610> per<00:04:11.700> second

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.540 
least 2000 to 2500 kilobits per second
so<00:04:12.270> high<00:04:12.480> or<00:04:13.470> recommended<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.100> can<00:04:14.220> also<00:04:14.370> get

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
so high or recommended you can also get

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.390 
so high or recommended you can also get
new<00:04:14.700> recommendations<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.959> will<00:04:16.109> do<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> test<00:04:17.010> to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
new recommendations it will do a test to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.970 
new recommendations it will do a test to
check<00:04:17.760> your<00:04:17.820> bandwidth<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.600> determine<00:04:19.380> what

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
check your bandwidth and determine what

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.240 
check your bandwidth and determine what
is<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.280> best<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.800> higher<00:04:23.040> you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
is the best for you so the higher you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.130 
is the best for you so the higher you
put<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.820> more<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.270> flag<00:04:24.510> depending

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
put it the more you can flag depending

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.409 
put it the more you can flag depending
on<00:04:25.230> your<00:04:25.410> upload<00:04:25.890> from<00:04:26.880> your<00:04:26.970> internet

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
on your upload from your internet

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.790 
on your upload from your internet
provider<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:28.050> check<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:28.710> to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
provider to check that go to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.370 
provider to check that go to
speedtest.net<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.900> would<00:04:31.050> probably<00:04:31.200> be

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
speedtest.net and that would probably be

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.080 
speedtest.net and that would probably be
the<00:04:31.470> easiest<00:04:31.980> way<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.190> check<00:04:32.460> exactly<00:04:32.970> what

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
the easiest way to check exactly what

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.520 
the easiest way to check exactly what
your<00:04:33.210> bandwidth<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.570> doing<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.169> best

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
your bandwidth is doing for best

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.770 
your bandwidth is doing for best
performance<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.190> recommend<00:04:35.700> using<00:04:36.270> direct

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
performance I recommend using direct

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.650 
performance I recommend using direct

connection Ethernet via ethernet cat5e
or<00:04:39.870> cat6<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:41.750> once<00:04:42.750> that's<00:04:42.960> all<00:04:43.110> set<00:04:43.140> up<00:04:43.440> you

or cat6 so once that's all set up you

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.670

hit<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.800> back<00:04:43.980> button<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.490> then<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:46.560> know

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
hit the back button and then you know

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.310 
hit the back button and then you know
you<00:04:46.740> go<00:04:46.950> down<00:04:46.980> hit<00:04:47.730> B<00:04:47.940> one<00:04:48.120> more<00:04:48.270> time<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:49.169> get

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
you go down hit B one more time to get

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.420 
you go down hit B one more time to get
out<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.440> those<00:04:49.530> settings<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.190> click

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
out of those settings and you can click

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.640 
out of those settings and you can click
start<00:04:50.640> broadcast<00:04:50.790> so<00:04:51.450> once<00:04:52.110> that's<00:04:52.380> done

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
start broadcast so once that's done

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.409 
start broadcast so once that's done
you're<00:04:53.610> good<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.030> go<00:04:54.560> so

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
you're good to go so

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.629 
you're good to go so
it's<00:04:56.629> gonna<00:04:56.780> show<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.110> right<00:04:57.469> here<00:04:57.639> that

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
it's gonna show you right here that

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.149 
it's gonna show you right here that
everything<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.240> working<00:04:59.889> recommendations<00:05:00.889> I

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
everything is working recommendations I

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.929 
everything is working recommendations I
would<00:05:01.189> probably<00:05:02.090> prefer<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:03.830> play<00:05:04.490> fullscreen

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
would probably prefer to play fullscreen

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:06.760 
would probably prefer to play fullscreen
so<00:05:05.569> if<00:05:05.659> you<00:05:05.750> want<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:05.990> do<00:05:06.139> that

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
so if you want to do that

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.520 
so if you want to do that
