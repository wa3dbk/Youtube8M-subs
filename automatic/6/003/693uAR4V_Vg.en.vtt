00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 assassin's creed 2 how many memories then 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.290
 rich without being seen bribing i 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
 auctioneers so that indeed conspiracy not 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 they talked about throwing themselves from any place e 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 center the bales of hay already the jumps 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.790
 of faith but cabbage what's more 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.260
 nice to throw yourself without any 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.670
 protection hoping not to become 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
 accredited once you have landed 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 with so much only on the ball it becomes 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.939
 all this from one of the coolest monuments 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.090
 florence but obviously throw off the tour 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.090
 eiffel 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.960
 well 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.529
 thin which ensures unlucky shows 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.120
 ex kept them in this new one 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.559
 adventure in which with me and 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.870
 secondary kartistic backwaters by 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.070
 assassin's creed iii unity ok ok i admit 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 to have been maybe a little too much 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.000
 exaggerated in unity you won't find the tour 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.470
 eiffel is not yet born but already the only one 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.540
 thought of taking the guards in blows 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.800
 of baguette with melandri infixed together with 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.510
 shank I had the chance to try 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.550
 a cover session of a chapter 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.890
 of assassin's guess who not not 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.329
 cola nigri much more but that crazy but 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.519
 I'll tell you with one of the developers 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.079
 of ubisoft montreal the session lasted 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.820
 about 20 minutes the right time to do 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.409
 understand to the developer how much fossils 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.479
 with more infant fuel controls 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.680
 in the technology he had since he can 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.850
 play for the animal more lidi like 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.990
 you have already guessed san vito di in 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.700
 france for this seventh chapter 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.810
 ubisoft wanted to renew the gap of 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.950
 game taking the movements of the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.420
 protagonist more fluid a little more 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 realistic realistic ones 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.880
 depending on which the meter of 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.170
 comparison allearci would not succeed 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.340
 however central the bale of hay e 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.720
 even if it had to do, it would open a 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.750
 gap in time space that would move 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.310
 god his little coat has the park 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.570
 of the stop protagonist arno will cost either 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.729
 of a rising phase than of a descent 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.840
 to sell more b in the xbox one case 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.009
 one tries to go down easily 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 taking advantage of every useful foothold 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.280
 thus eliminating any internal from 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.900
 fall to roman surely make us 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 andrea minella general difficulty of the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.780
 play forward who of you is never 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.920
 scarred after having bet but 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.630
 I also say in the neighbor who was 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.590
 going to spy on one of the coolest things 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.450
 my opinion was the great importance 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 ubisoft answer of the collaboration the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.110
 dozens of killers will be available 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 and dozens of distinct cooperative missiles 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.990
 from more or less stars based on theirs 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.550
 difficulties in which it will be vital to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.810
 a good agreement with the sections up to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.950
 four players for example of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.299
 we will look at the bombs 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.590
 smoke when you go to buy 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.150
 dirty work but also more flight 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.960
 fun is for the series not all 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.580
 evils come to harm 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.260
 at the moment obviously or by way of 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.030
 throw away the switchable stealth mode 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.830
 with the pressure of lp or unleashed one 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.090
 of the key moments of the saga 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.260
 many in the past did not complain the little 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.120
 difficulty in fighting 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.440
 murderers pointing to one more one discover 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.879
 barley of enemies that probably 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 everyone would like to see from my hand I have 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.549
 always thought instead this choice as 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.290
 the possibility of fine friends 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.670
 with more spectacularity in this unity 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.200
 so that they will have chosen them for 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.940
 number of scarce logics of many 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 crosses as artificial pencils director me 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.670
 it seemed a lot improved i 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.379
 counterattacks will require a 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.700
 my timing is decidedly more polished 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.700
 self-esteem will surely suffer 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 but the news does not end there for 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.120
 please the most demanding players 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.380
 that maybe they have a little more soul 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000
 stylish it will be possible to customize 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.980
 arno in hundreds of different ways 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.510
 commando head bust arm and much 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.920
 another will therefore be a laugh to see how 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.450
 you will be able to bring arles and above all 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.490
 left spontaneous care this point one 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.810
 slogan enzo fuse abba as the 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.460
 customization will not be limited to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.050
 make it more palatable to damsels in 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.610
 looking for baguettes we will have the chance 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.900
 to assign via vico the author continues 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.370
 diversability to our protagonist 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.870
 so it will be up to us to decide what 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.490
 empowering is a question of play 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.140
 continue our pure adventure not 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.570
 they found to have a pungent worthy rhythm 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.860
 of a murderer the king is sharp 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.200
 mysterious and even a little asshole a little 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.000
 as indeed how not to love one who 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.010
 enter the game is already as you will have understood 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.720
 my expectations because they are and are 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.070
 also quite autre if instead the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.750
 latest grand prizes have convinced 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.350
 take the game what awaits us 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.670
 the exit 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.230
 said this kid miniusb irace 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.270
 too much because like I said to let cry 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 also for assassin's creed beautiful minutes 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.350
 of gameplay are not enough to give 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.060
 a complete judgment regarding the title 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.980
 however it is important to know yours too 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.080
 but what appeared to be this game later 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.240
 having also heard considerations and after 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.560
 having seen these few minutes gameplay 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.140
 I'm sorry if maybe you don't just go out 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.950
 reward everything there was to do 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.870
 to see 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.900
 unfortunately we have the function of b 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.770
 roll predicts there because it was really a 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.820
 something extremely klose is 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.100
 unfortunate there is one of the products 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.080
 until you can even report these 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.490
 this information for these minutes of 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.730
 video so at this our 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.989
 impression comments below if there 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.209
 had to be a nice audience up 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.920
 beware of the head and the next video 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.540
 beautiful then it has always been yours 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.620
 the more he believes in dream driving a lambo 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.620
 helicopter a crane
