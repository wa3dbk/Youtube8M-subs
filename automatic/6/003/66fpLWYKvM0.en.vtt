00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello everyone my name is Maria and 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.059
 first of all I want to thank you 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.469
 for giving play this video on the day of 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.020
 Today I'm going to teach you how to do something very 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.430
 nice for your pet and we're going to do 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.869
 a bed with a sweater with a sweater and 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.990
 with some more materials but 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.359
 practically everything is the base of the super 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.439
 so if you like haiti mills 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.189
 how am I going to do it 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.290
 keep looking at the materials that we are going to 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.640
 use is going to be a sweater 14 for 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 filling needle and thread 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.990
 ok here I started putting a tape of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.790
 bent 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.160
 everything ends the sleeve towards the other 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.680
 extreme this is going to help so that I do not 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.900
 go so crooked when sewing here 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.670
 I'm sewing with a basic stitch 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.629
 I was also reading what they call him 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.180
 stitch of castile but I do not know how you 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.670
 after sewing it you will know how we are going 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.860
 to put stuffing in this part we have 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.479
 that also sew neck the neck what 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.119
 you can get into the inside out 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.340
 to me the truth does not matter to me then what 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.009
 I left for outside as I want it is not going to 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.250
 see a lot then what remains the same 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.680
 basic computation and what is important here is 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.740
 that we give him one or more passes to 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.450
 that holds the kitchen and does not leave us 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.909
 break the thread 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.600
 with the wadding we're going to fix all the 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.420
 sleeve and all the neck end and I 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.740
 he puts on his sleeve 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.909
 here do not stop the wadding so that I 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.909
 is the mattress adif or 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.040
 ah 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.390
 here is mine to fill my sleeve and 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.560
 part of the neck and I 'll pass you 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.560
 to reign the other 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 once I have already filled my two 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.080
 sleeves I'm going to fill in what is the part 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.149
 of the tummy 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.880
 here do not stop the wadding leaves it like 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.730
 I was and how are you going to see right now? 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.830
 as a very nice camita type and also 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 we are going to sew the bottom part so that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.050
 obviously the wadding does not come out 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.650
 same with the basic tip and I gave him two or 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.650
 three passes 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.010
 and we've taken the bottom and the two 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.500
 sleeves let's put the sleeves here 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.170
 I'm going to put one on top of the other and with my 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.960
 needle and thread I'm going to give you another little 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.790
 so that it is well tied here if you 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.160
 I gave three more passes because I do not want 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.840
 come out because imagine yourself sessa les va 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.500
 to be all deformed my bed then 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.420
 here things the same 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.880
 once we have already taken the sleeves 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.920
 let's go for a spin and let's take 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.920
 all of the below along with the most 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.700
 we are going to stitch many many 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.040
 stitches above will break us 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.360
 the thread I forgot to tell you the thread 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.910

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.820

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.340
 out of plastic one I suppose time 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.100

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.490
 Normal good I think it is clear in order 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.130

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.040
