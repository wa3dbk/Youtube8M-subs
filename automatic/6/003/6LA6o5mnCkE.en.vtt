00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hi, I'm from the evil one and I'm going to tell you about that stupid game called 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.930
 counter extra and lic 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.310
 First, I will explain what this game is about, although you will probably already know 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.089
 what's going on 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.240
 tries that two teams one of ct and one of terrorists have to kill 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.949
 on a given map holding hostages or bomb 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.810
 although the terrorists always kill the hostages the very bastards for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.390
 that cetes can not save them and forcing them to kill all 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.679
 terrorists and in the case of the bomb 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.319
 when they put it on, they stay camper killing anything that moves and 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.050
 when the bomb is going to explode they run like cowards with their tails 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 between the legs so that the pump does not kill them 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.430
 Now that you know what the game is about, I'm going to talk about the types of players 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.900
 I hope not to forget any 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.070
 there are the noxes that are so bad people playing that the only thing they lack is 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.880
 not knowing how to shoot or move would serve very well to attract enemy fire but 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.300
 out because they last very very very very little 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.700
 are the normals 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.810
 They are not bad but not good people who kill as many times as they die 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.430
 are the zetas or campers who stay hidden somewhere with 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.180
 sniper waiting for an enemy player to arrive to kill him 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.720
 these are cowards who do not have eggs to go out and shoot 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 sons of his whore and mother 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.300
 and finally there are the 'pross' 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.170
 these are some 'fucking geeks with no social life who spend 18 hours 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.079
 followed playing counter extra left 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.799
 they kill you with a shot to the head just by seeing a thousandth of a second 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.130
 and if you're lucky that I do not hit something unlikely 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.490
 it does not matter if you use 20 as 40 chargers 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.180
 the guy living there will kill you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.440
 they only die because of a big mistake or when they meet another 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.690
 I forgot 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.330
 there are also the jaqueses 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.590
 these bastards suck cocks bastards use downloaded programs to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.800
 use them and have powers that other players do not have like for example the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.460
 guayacÃ¡n 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.960
 that allows you to see where the players are even through the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.650
 wall 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.670
 now let's talk about the different game modes 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.400
 is in normal to kill each other 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.630
 there's soccer 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 which consists of putting balls in the opposite goal like a fool although 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 people instead of doing that they kill themselves with the knife without stopping happening 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.199
 completely from the ball 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.359
 There is the one of warcraft that consists in that you direct a race that you want 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.849
 As you gain more Basque experience, new powers or 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.829
 improving them when you get them 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.829
 all this translated an authentic shit for geeks 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:27.519
 is the surf that in certain maps you can go as the name says 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.629
 surfing on paths that put you day you have to kill the contrary this one 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.629
 it's wrong but there are always people who know a lot in this item they tie nothing more 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.469
 start the game and if it is not a bread server you have to wait for it 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.969
 kill and the games will last a jug 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.709
 and finally that I remember is that of zombies this is the best with 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.579
 difference that is about a random player becoming infected and becoming 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.559
 zombie and has to go infecting others to turn them into zombies and 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.619
 so win 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:58.539
 I know this video is not very funny but it's the first one I do and I'll go 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:59.549
 getting better 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.249
 and I tell you that if you are of those fucking geek people who play an extra counter and 18 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:08.349
 hours a day or more do not get to put comments insulting me 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.379
 you have heard children of the great whore because that's nothing of insults 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.329
 and everyone else thank you for watching the video and I want you to put me and it's five
