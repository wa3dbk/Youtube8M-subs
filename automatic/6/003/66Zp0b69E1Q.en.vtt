system<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.949> using<00:00:20.539> clockworkmod

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
system that you have using clockworkmod

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.349 
system that you have using clockworkmod
and<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.250> should<00:00:23.550> work<00:00:23.730> although<00:00:24.029> this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and this should work although this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.349 
and this should work although this

doesn't matter really which version of
the<00:00:39.829> ROM<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.610> could<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.820> stock<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the ROM you have you could have stock in

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.319 
the ROM you have you could have stock in
it<00:00:42.629> even<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.469> could<00:00:43.620> still<00:00:43.829> use

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
it even and you could still use

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.790 
it even and you could still use
clockworkmod<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.629> Ibaka<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.500> difference

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
clockworkmod for Ibaka the difference

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.880 
clockworkmod for Ibaka the difference
would<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> had<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.030> stock<00:00:48.890> rom

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
would be that if you had a stock rom

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.549 
would be that if you had a stock rom
then<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.700> would<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.930> external

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
version of clockworkmod to get started

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
version of clockworkmod to get started
but<00:00:58.609> we're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.910> ahead<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.270> shut<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
but we're going to go ahead and shut it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.790 
but we're going to go ahead and shut it
down

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
down

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.799

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this is running ICS but it would make

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
this is running ICS but it would make

any difference stock or whatever we're

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.539 
any difference stock or whatever we're
gonna<00:01:05.580> power<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:07.439> ok<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:10.430> when<00:01:11.430> it

stock<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.120> used<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.570> next<00:02:24.810> tunnel<00:02:24.930> chip

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
stock and you used the next tunnel chip

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.290 
stock and you used the next tunnel chip
at<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.010> point<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.460> wanted<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.880> do<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
at this point if you wanted to do a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.350 
at this point if you wanted to do a
backup<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:28.350> stock<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.820> would<00:02:29.970> need<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
backup with stock you would need to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
backup with stock you would need to
remove<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:32.870> clockworkmod<00:02:33.870> chip<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
remove the clockworkmod chip and put a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.960 
remove the clockworkmod chip and put a
standard<00:02:36.260> chip<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.500> that's<00:02:37.800> not<00:02:38.130> bootable<00:02:38.520> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
standard chip in that's not bootable and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.330 
standard chip in that's not bootable and
that's<00:02:39.630> what<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.740> an<00:02:40.980> SD<00:02:41.160> card

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that's what I have in now is an SD card

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.850 
that's what I have in now is an SD card
that's<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:41.880> bootable<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.620> a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that's not bootable and I can do a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.960 
that's not bootable and I can do a
backup<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:46.260> over<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
backup with that so I go over here to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.860 
backup with that so I go over here to
backup<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.330> restore

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
backup and restore

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.800 
backup and restore
select<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:51.090> backup<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.600> found

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
select it and do backup and it found

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.940 
select it and do backup and it found
that<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:56.000> four<00:02:57.000> Meg's<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.480> space<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.500> it's

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that I have four Meg's of space and it's

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.280 
that I have four Meg's of space and it's
going<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.400> go<00:03:00.120> ahead<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.390> do<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> backup<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.140> me

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
going to go ahead and do a backup for me

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
going to go ahead and do a backup for me
so<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> process<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.940> backing<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
so it's in the process of backing up the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.150 
so it's in the process of backing up the
system<00:03:05.840> now<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.140> will<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.320> backup<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:07.980> it's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
system now what will it backup all it's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.800 
system now what will it backup all it's
doing<00:03:08.400> all<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.270> will<00:03:09.390> back<00:03:09.600> up

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
doing all this it will back up

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.960 
doing all this it will back up
everything<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:11.280> rom<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.630> data<00:03:13.110> everything

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
everything the rom the data everything

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.750 
everything the rom the data everything
so<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.209> if<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.020> wipe<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.650> device<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.370> then

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
so that if you wipe the device and then

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.660 
so that if you wipe the device and then
did<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> restore<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:19.170> will<00:03:19.350> restore<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:20.070> system

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
did a restore it will restore the system

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.840 
did a restore it will restore the system
exactly<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.860> or<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.250> last<00:03:23.640> time

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
exactly like it is or was the last time

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
exactly like it is or was the last time
I<00:03:23.910> shut<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.180> down<00:03:24.390> before<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.560> clockwork

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
I shut it down before and a clockwork

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
I shut it down before and a clockwork
not<00:03:26.130> back<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:27.330> it's<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.660> pretty<00:03:28.520> great<00:03:29.520> tool

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
not back it so it's a pretty great tool

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.100 
not back it so it's a pretty great tool
to<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> good<00:03:31.200> backup<00:03:31.610> before<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:33.110> maybe

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
to have a good backup before you maybe

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.500 
to have a good backup before you maybe
flash<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> new<00:03:34.739> rom<00:03:34.980> or<00:03:35.520> before<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.120> make<00:03:36.330> some

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
flash a new rom or before you make some

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.690 
flash a new rom or before you make some
major<00:03:36.840> changes<00:03:37.020> or<00:03:37.920> every<00:03:38.370> once<00:03:38.520> in<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.670> while

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
major changes or every once in a while

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.490 
major changes or every once in a while
it's<00:03:38.970> good<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.300> do<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.450> backup<00:03:39.840> anyway<00:03:40.080> because

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
it's good to do a backup anyway because

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.240 
it's good to do a backup anyway because
your<00:03:40.739> settings<00:03:41.130> may<00:03:41.340> change<00:03:41.670> your<00:03:42.180> screens

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
your settings may change your screens

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.170 
your settings may change your screens
whatever<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.489> on<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.730> home<00:03:44.880> screen

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
whatever you have on the home screen

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.020 
whatever you have on the home screen
whatever<00:03:46.910> icons<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.150> install<00:03:48.750> or<00:03:49.110> whatever

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
whatever icons you install or whatever

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.000 
whatever icons you install or whatever
programs<00:03:51.030> apps<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.780> have<00:03:51.810> installed<00:03:52.110> all<00:03:52.769> of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
programs apps you have installed all of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.830 
programs apps you have installed all of
that<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.310> backed<00:03:53.550> up<00:03:53.790> for<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.209> automatically

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
that is backed up for you automatically

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.870 
that is backed up for you automatically
so<00:03:55.380> it's<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.620> pretty<00:03:55.860> large<00:03:56.130> backup<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.730> takes

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
so it's a pretty large backup it takes

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.500 
so it's a pretty large backup it takes
about<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.580> takes<00:03:59.790> about<00:03:59.910> 2<00:04:00.209> gigs

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
about I think and it takes about 2 gigs

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.920 
about I think and it takes about 2 gigs
to<00:04:00.959> backup<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:02.070> entire<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.580> entire<00:04:03.510> thing<00:04:03.780> so

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
to backup the entire to entire thing so

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.979 
to backup the entire to entire thing so
it<00:04:04.500> takes<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.860> lot<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> your<00:04:05.250> your<00:04:05.910> space<00:04:06.120> on

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
it takes up a lot of your your space on

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.070 
it takes up a lot of your your space on
the<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.720> device<00:04:10.530> or<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.130> SD<00:04:11.459> card<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:13.019> you

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
the the device or on the SD card so you

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.080 
the the device or on the SD card so you
can't<00:04:13.320> keep<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.500> lot<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.070> backups<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> small

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
can't keep a lot of backups on a small

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.680 
can't keep a lot of backups on a small
card<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:17.160> can<00:04:17.370> keep<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.730> couple<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.060> active

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
card but you can keep a couple of active

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.039 
card but you can keep a couple of active
backends<00:04:19.080> so<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.669> go<00:04:21.359> ahead<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.690> hold<00:04:21.840> on

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
backends so just go ahead and hold on

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.140 
backends so just go ahead and hold on
while<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:22.620> doing<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> backup<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:23.970> get

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
while it's doing the backup so you get

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.740 
while it's doing the backup so you get
an<00:04:24.240> idea<00:04:24.510> how

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
an idea how

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.100 
an idea how
it<00:04:25.110> takes<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.280> takes<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.810> know<00:04:27.900> if<00:04:28.020> you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
it takes but it takes you know if you

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.560 
it takes but it takes you know if you
decide<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.500> skip<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:29.580> takes<00:04:29.850> probably<00:04:30.390> about

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
decide to skip it takes probably about

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.450 
decide to skip it takes probably about
five<00:04:31.050> minutes<00:04:31.350> for<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.710> whole<00:04:31.800> thing

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
five minutes for the whole thing
