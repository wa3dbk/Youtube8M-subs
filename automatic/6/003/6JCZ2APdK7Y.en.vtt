more than their body is conditioned to

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.150 
more than their body is conditioned to
handle<00:00:52.719> so<00:00:53.140> I<00:00:53.170> recommend<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.890> do<00:00:54.039> it

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
handle so I recommend that you do it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.950 
handle so I recommend that you do it
ease<00:00:54.609> into<00:00:54.879> it<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.239> know<00:00:55.359> I<00:00:55.390> might<00:00:55.629> just<00:00:55.660> do<00:00:55.929> a

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
ease into it you know I might just do a

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.110 
ease into it you know I might just do a
random<00:00:56.199> walk<00:00:56.530> until<00:00:57.190> you<00:00:57.249> get<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.910> point

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
random walk until you get to the point

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.090 
random walk until you get to the point
where<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.480> can<00:00:58.660> run<00:00:58.960> for<00:00:59.320> say<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.469> kill<00:00:59.890> Anita

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
where you can run for say a kill Anita

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.790 
where you can run for say a kill Anita
without<00:01:00.699> stopping<00:01:01.149> that<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.199> way<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.440> do<00:01:02.620> it

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
without stopping that is a way to do it

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.700 
without stopping that is a way to do it
okay<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:03.820> running<00:01:04.089> consistently<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.530> don't

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
okay so running consistently you don't

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.080 
okay so running consistently you don't
to<00:01:05.770> do<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:05.920> every<00:01:06.130> day<00:01:06.160> I<00:01:06.550> didn't<00:01:06.760> do<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:06.910> every

you're not gonna burn fat efficiently
you<00:01:49.870> know<00:01:49.990> check<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.320> out<00:01:50.470> too<00:01:50.710> fat

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
you know check it out too fat

you know check it out too fat
keep<00:01:51.760> your<00:01:51.970> b12<00:01:52.450> levels<00:01:52.840> topped<00:01:53.080> up<00:01:53.230> I<00:01:53.440> do<00:01:53.500> that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
keep your b12 levels topped up I do that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.860 
keep your b12 levels topped up I do that
by<00:01:53.920> taking<00:01:54.100> shots<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.880> then<00:01:55.360> your<00:01:55.510> body<00:01:55.780> is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
by taking shots and then your body is

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.870 
by taking shots and then your body is
going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.260> be<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.590> efficiently<00:01:57.130> burning<00:01:57.610> fat

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
going to be more efficiently burning fat

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.000 
going to be more efficiently burning fat
also<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.660> last<00:01:58.840> one<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.140> indefinitely<00:01:59.650> water

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
also the last one is indefinitely water

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.950 
also the last one is indefinitely water

to be flushing out all the toxins in the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.750 
to be flushing out all the toxins in the
fat<00:02:17.380> rather<00:02:17.590> than<00:02:17.800> hanging<00:02:17.980> onto<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.580> so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
fat rather than hanging onto it so

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.320
