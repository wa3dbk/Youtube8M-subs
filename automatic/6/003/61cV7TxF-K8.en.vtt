around the piece of cardboard but you
need<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.199> neat<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> can

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
need to be really neat about it you can

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530 
need to be really neat about it you can
probably<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.680> sloppy<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.519> first<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
probably be a little sloppy at first you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.960 
probably be a little sloppy at first you
just<00:01:06.570> wind<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> all<00:01:07.260> around<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
just wind it all around and then just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.679 
just wind it all around and then just
push<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> together<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.960> it'll<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.210> really<00:01:12.210> nice

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
push it together so it'll be really nice

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.429 
push it together so it'll be really nice
and<00:01:13.049> neat<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.189> ultimately<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.049> said<00:01:16.259> we're

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and neat so ultimately like I said we're

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
and neat so ultimately like I said we're
making<00:01:16.560> her<00:01:16.830> bangs<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.640> start<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> be

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
making her bangs to start with it can be

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.780 
making her bangs to start with it can be
any<00:01:21.270> thickness<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:21.990> length<00:01:22.439> pretty<00:01:23.369> much<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
any thickness or length pretty much that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.749 
any thickness or length pretty much that
you<00:01:23.939> want<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:24.869> stick<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:26.130> layer<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you want I would stick to one layer of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
you want I would stick to one layer of
yarn<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.960> now<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.710> could

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
yarn for right now but you could

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.690 
yarn for right now but you could
obviously<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.090> creative<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.259> like

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
obviously do more creative as you like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
obviously do more creative as you like
okay

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
okay

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
okay
once<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> done<00:01:34.040> put<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.159> where

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
once you have that done put that where

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060 
once you have that done put that where
you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> um<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:37.500> could<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:37.799> some

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you can see it um you could take some

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
you can see it um you could take some
painters<00:01:38.430> tape<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.119> guess<00:01:39.630> cause<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:39.990> like

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
painters tape I guess cause it's like

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.399 
painters tape I guess cause it's like
it's<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> sticky<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.850> cheap

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
it's not a sticky or some really cheap

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.730 
it's not a sticky or some really cheap
masking<00:01:43.409> tape<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.360> tape

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
masking tape and you want to just tape

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.609 
masking tape and you want to just tape
down<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.509> top<00:01:48.509> part<00:01:48.840> okay

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
down the top part okay

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
down the top part okay
see<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> took<00:01:51.270> me<00:01:51.420> awhile<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
see like that and it took me awhile to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.230 
see like that and it took me awhile to
figure<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.590> well<00:01:53.100> oh<00:01:53.310> yeah<00:01:53.939> don't

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
a piece of interfacing the cheaper the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.420 
a piece of interfacing the cheaper the
better<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.200> tears<00:02:45.410> real<00:02:45.710> easily<00:02:45.920> and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
better because it tears real easily and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.570

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
you're just gonna pin the interfacing

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.320 
you're just gonna pin the interfacing
here's<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.410> piece<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.770> already<00:02:51.980> finished<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
here's a piece I already finished to the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.110 
here's a piece I already finished to the
tape<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.020> doll<00:02:57.230> hair<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.940> also<00:02:58.940> put<00:02:59.090> a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
tape and the doll hair and also put a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000 
tape and the doll hair and also put a
piece<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.330> interfacing<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.290> back<00:03:00.620> side

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.920 
now because you've got that sticky tape
the<00:03:03.260> interfacing<00:03:03.860> will<00:03:04.010> probably<00:03:04.520> lay<00:03:04.670> down

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
the interfacing will probably lay down

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.300 
the interfacing will probably lay down
because<00:03:05.930> what<00:03:06.110> you're<00:03:06.230> gonna<00:03:06.410> want<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.800> do<00:03:06.950> is
