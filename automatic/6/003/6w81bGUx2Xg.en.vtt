00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the fan clips very nice design they kind

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.819 
the fan clips very nice design they kind
of<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.989> them<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> where<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.680> your

thumb to clip them on there and they

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.610 
thumb to clip them on there and they
don't<00:00:43.219> interfere<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.750> any<00:00:45.750> air<00:00:46.320> flow

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
difference here and I did not install

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
difference here and I did not install
the<00:00:51.410> anti<00:00:52.410> vibration<00:00:52.620> mounts<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> does

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the anti vibration mounts but that does

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.630 
the anti vibration mounts but that does
include<00:00:56.550> those<00:00:58.129> yeah<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> make

this video show you guys how large this
thing<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:01.949> fans<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.430> actually

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
thing is and these fans are actually

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.890 
thing is and these fans are actually
mounted<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.110> too<00:01:04.350> low<00:01:05.689> it's<00:01:06.689> definitely

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
mounted a little too low it's definitely

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700 
mounted a little too low it's definitely
will<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.409> clear<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> mounting<00:01:09.840> bracket<00:01:10.020> on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

will not clear the mounting bracket on
that<00:01:11.159> middle<00:01:11.340> fan<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:13.320> front<00:01:13.619> fan<00:01:13.890> would

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that middle fan and this front fan would

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
that middle fan and this front fan would
not<00:01:14.310> clear<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> RAM<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:17.540> some<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.689> boards

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
not clear the RAM on some other boards

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.120 
not clear the RAM on some other boards
it's<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> watch<00:01:21.150> out

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
it's one thing you do have to watch out

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's one thing you do have to watch out
you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.400> however<00:01:23.580> mount<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.680> per<00:01:25.680> se<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you can however mount this per se if you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.719 
you can however mount this per se if you
wanted<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:28.369> don't<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
wanted to like this I don't think that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
wanted to like this I don't think that
would<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> problem<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:31.200> yet<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> mount

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
would be a problem I have yet to mount

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
would be a problem I have yet to mount

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
nice sleeved cables on these fans it's

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.530 
nice sleeved cables on these fans it's
one<00:02:17.950> thing<00:02:17.980> i<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.310> say<00:02:18.520> i<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:18.910> do<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.270> in

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:29.190 
one thing i can say i really do like in
there<00:02:19.920> pwm<00:02:20.920> fans<00:02:22.080> these<00:02:23.080> push<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:28.450> 13<00:02:28.930> it's

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
there pwm fans these push it's 13 it's

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
there pwm fans these push it's 13 it's
900<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.980> 1300<00:02:30.730> RPM<00:02:32.070> pwm<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.370> i<00:02:33.850> believe<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
900 to 1300 RPM pwm and i believe the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.860 
900 to 1300 RPM pwm and i believe the
max<00:02:34.840> airflow<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:36.600> 75<00:02:37.709> CFM<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.600> even<00:02:40.600> at<00:02:40.720> one

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
max airflow is 75 CFM and even at one

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.870 
max airflow is 75 CFM and even at one
hundred<00:02:41.050> percent<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.890> actually<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.700> one

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
hundred percent I actually have one

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.220 
hundred percent I actually have one
running<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.420> case<00:02:43.600> right<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:43.870> it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
running in the case right now it's

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.430 
running in the case right now it's
actually<00:02:44.590> quieter<00:02:45.160> running<00:02:46.120> full<00:02:46.510> speed<00:02:46.750> then

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
actually quieter running full speed then

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.620 
actually quieter running full speed then
a<00:02:47.890> lot<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.190> my<00:02:48.280> other<00:02:48.310> case<00:02:48.670> fans<00:02:48.970> are<00:02:49.209> running

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
a lot of my other case fans are running
