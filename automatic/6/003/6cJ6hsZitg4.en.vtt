with an idea it's called snowflakes on a
plate<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.699> game<00:00:20.880> idea<00:00:21.210> you're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
plate and the game idea you're going to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.640 
plate and the game idea you're going to
need<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.930> cut<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> paper<00:00:22.680> into<00:00:23.119> squares<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
need to cut the paper into squares and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
need to cut the paper into squares and
have<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.890> kids<00:00:26.689> take<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> squares<00:00:28.199> fold<00:00:28.800> them

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
have the kids take the squares fold them

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.330 
have the kids take the squares fold them
up<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.189> cut<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.410> those<00:00:31.410> little<00:00:31.800> snowflakes

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
up and cut out those little snowflakes

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.360 
up and cut out those little snowflakes
like<00:00:32.910> when<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> made<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.540> you're<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> kid<00:00:34.020> now

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.310 

we<00:00:38.370> recommend<00:00:38.879> making<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.809> five

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we recommend making about five

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.160 
we recommend making about five
snowflakes<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.670> game<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.930> what

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
snowflakes for this game and then what

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.319 
snowflakes for this game and then what
we're<00:00:43.320> gonna<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.800> we're<00:00:44.399> gonna<00:00:44.460> set<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.879> how

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
we're gonna do is we're gonna set up how

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.439 
we're gonna do is we're gonna set up how
to<00:00:45.360> play<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:47.300> show<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:50.300> once<00:00:51.300> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to play and show you what to do once you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
to play and show you what to do once you
cut<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.840> all<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> snowflakes<00:00:52.680> you're<00:00:53.250> ready

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
cut out all the snowflakes you're ready

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
cut out all the snowflakes you're ready
to<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.960> need<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> take<00:00:55.800> your

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to go what you need to do is take your

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.819 
to go what you need to do is take your
plate<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> any<00:00:57.510> plate<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.109> set<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
plate and any plate will do set it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.150 
plate and any plate will do set it
approximately<00:00:59.520> three<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.090> four<00:01:00.359> feet<00:01:00.690> away

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
approximately three to four feet away

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.109 
approximately three to four feet away
from<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.699> game<00:01:02.910> player<00:01:04.339> now<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.090> be

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
from the game player now this can be

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.390 
from the game player now this can be
erased<00:01:06.479> done<00:01:06.900> by<00:01:07.200> individuals<00:01:07.950> sitting<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
erased done by individuals sitting at a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.149 
erased done by individuals sitting at a
table<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.409> played<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> relay

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
table or it can be played as a relay

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.240 
table or it can be played as a relay
race<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.670> basically<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> concept<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
race and basically the concept is is you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
race and basically the concept is is you
take<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> snowflakes<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> they're

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
take all the snowflakes and they're

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.969 
take all the snowflakes and they're
placed<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.680> front<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> player<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> they

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
placed in front of the player so they

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
placed in front of the player so they
can<00:01:20.159> play<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.290> straw<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.390> get

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
can play then they use the straw to get

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
can play then they use the straw to get
the<00:01:25.110> snowflakes<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> plate<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the snowflakes on the plate now the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.280 
the snowflakes on the plate now the
first<00:01:27.090> time<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.420> happens<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> kids<00:01:28.170> are

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
first time this happens the kids are

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.950 
first time this happens the kids are
probably<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
probably going to go and then the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
probably going to go and then the
snowflakes<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.280> everywhere

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
snowflakes are going to go everywhere

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.160 
snowflakes are going to go everywhere
but<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.720> onto<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
but they're not going to go up onto the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.929 
but they're not going to go up onto the
plate

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
plate

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.550 
plate
here's<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.150> secret<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> either<00:01:37.290> let

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
here's the secret you can either let

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
here's the secret you can either let
them<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.640> beginning<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
them in on it at the beginning or you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
them in on it at the beginning or you
can<00:01:40.890> let<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.189> struggle<00:01:41.490> until<00:01:41.939> someone

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
can let them struggle until someone

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.710 
can let them struggle until someone
finds<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.680> secret<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.579> use<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
finds it out the secret is to use the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.340 
finds it out the secret is to use the
straw<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> suction<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:50.250> pick<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:51.350> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
straw in the suction to pick up the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
straw in the suction to pick up the
snowflake<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.220> blow<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> towards<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
snowflake and then blow it towards the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.870 
snowflake and then blow it towards the
plate<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.170> goal<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.890> land<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
plate and the goal is to land the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.030 
plate and the goal is to land the
snowflake<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.409> snowflakes<00:01:58.920> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
