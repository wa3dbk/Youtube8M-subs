hi welcome aboard my name's mark cork

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.480 
hi welcome aboard my name's mark cork
from<00:00:09.389> vote<00:00:09.660> US<00:00:09.990> magazine<00:00:10.500> today<00:00:11.040> we're<00:00:11.340> going

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
from vote US magazine today we're going

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610 
from vote US magazine today we're going
to<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.670> bleeding<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.179> diesel<00:00:12.540> engine<00:00:12.900> we

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
to be bleeding a diesel engine we

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.950 
to be bleeding a diesel engine we
previously<00:00:14.120> changed<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> fuel<00:00:15.450> filter<00:00:15.809> on

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
previously changed the fuel filter on

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.810 
previously changed the fuel filter on
this<00:00:16.049> engine<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.220> change<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.580> fuel

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
this engine but when you change a fuel

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.150 
this engine but when you change a fuel
filter<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.570> introduces<00:00:19.170> air<00:00:19.410> into<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> system

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
filter it introduces air into the system

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160 
filter it introduces air into the system
and<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.789> whole<00:00:21.000> idea<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.420> bleeding<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> is

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and the whole idea of bleeding it is

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.160 
and the whole idea of bleeding it is
that<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> get<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> air<00:00:23.220> out<00:00:23.869> now<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
that we have to get that air out now a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.710 
that we have to get that air out now a
fuel<00:00:25.949> system<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> diesel<00:00:27.180> engine<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
fuel system on a diesel engine is a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929 
fuel system on a diesel engine is a
closed<00:00:28.080> system<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.220> other<00:00:29.340> words<00:00:29.640> if

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
closed system so in other words if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
closed system so in other words if
there's<00:00:30.119> any<00:00:30.330> air<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.560> engine

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
there's any air in there the engine

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
there's any air in there the engine
would<00:00:32.189> either<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.820> start<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> does

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
would either not start or if it does

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
would either not start or if it does
start<00:00:34.260> it'll<00:00:34.530> die<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
start it'll die so what we have to do to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
start it'll die so what we have to do to
bleed<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:37.950> what's<00:00:38.219> called

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
bleed that out is we use what's called

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.520 
bleed that out is we use what's called
the<00:00:38.579> fuel<00:00:38.820> lift<00:00:39.090> pump<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> engine<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.170> we

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the fuel lift pump on the engine and we

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.160 
the fuel lift pump on the engine and we
manually<00:00:41.070> pump<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> pump<00:00:42.030> air<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
manually pump that to pump air out and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.510 
manually pump that to pump air out and
I'm<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> take<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.920> through<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> steps

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I'm going to take you through the steps

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.889 
I'm going to take you through the steps
to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.539> particularly

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to do that it's not particularly

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.049 
to do that it's not particularly
difficult<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.250> many<00:00:47.399> people

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
difficult but to many people

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.610 
difficult but to many people
believing<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> diesel<00:00:48.989> engine<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> seeing

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
believing a diesel engine is seeing

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.380 
believing a diesel engine is seeing
something<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> black<00:00:50.460> art<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.030> let's<00:00:51.239> get

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
something of a black art so let's get

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.170 
something of a black art so let's get
started<00:00:51.949> right<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.160> here's<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> fuel<00:00:53.789> filter

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
started right so here's the fuel filter

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
started right so here's the fuel filter
right<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.570> below<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:55.020> knee<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
right here below my knee and this is the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
right here below my knee and this is the
fuel<00:00:56.460> line<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:57.149> along<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.480> goes<00:00:57.930> around

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
fuel line going along here goes around

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
fuel line going along here goes around
here<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.160> comes<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
here and it comes to here this is the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
here and it comes to here this is the
lift<00:01:00.359> pump<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.410> from<00:01:01.649> there<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.129> goes<00:01:02.340> up

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
lift pump and then from there it goes up

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 
lift pump and then from there it goes up
this<00:01:02.670> braided<00:01:03.059> hose<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> secondary<00:01:04.710> fuel

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
this braided hose to the secondary fuel

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
this braided hose to the secondary fuel
filter<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:06.330> what's<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> happen<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
filter now what's going to happen is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
filter now what's going to happen is
because<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.710> changed<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> fuel<00:01:08.970> filter<00:01:09.390> here

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
because we changed the fuel filter here

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
because we changed the fuel filter here
we've<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.320> air<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.040> filter<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
we've got air in this filter we have to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.660 
we've got air in this filter we have to
pump<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> first<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> do

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
pump that out so the first thing to do

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
pump that out so the first thing to do
is<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.810> an<00:01:16.020> oil<00:01:16.380> absorbent<00:01:17.070> pad<00:01:17.340> under<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
is to get an oil absorbent pad under the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.850 
is to get an oil absorbent pad under the
filter<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.960> spill<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.530> fuel

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
filter because we will spill some fuel

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.020 
filter because we will spill some fuel
and<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> wrench<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.030> undo

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and then going to use a wrench and undo

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
and then going to use a wrench and undo
this<00:01:24.210> banjo<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.979> daddy's<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> take<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
this banjo not your daddy's to take it

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
this banjo not your daddy's to take it
all<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
all the way out but this is the on the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
all the way out but this is the on the
pressure<00:01:29.490> side<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> pump<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.979> pump<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
pressure side of the pump so we pump the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.810 
pressure side of the pump so we pump the
pump<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.360> fuel<00:01:34.049> will<00:01:34.229> come<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.310> we

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
pump and then fuel will come out so we

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.460 
pump and then fuel will come out so we
have<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> rag<00:01:36.240> handy<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:36.990> notice<00:01:37.170> I'm

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
have a rag handy and you'll notice I'm

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
have a rag handy and you'll notice I'm
wearing<00:01:37.770> gloves<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.850> want<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
wearing gloves because I don't want to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390 
wearing gloves because I don't want to
get<00:01:39.150> diesel<00:01:39.479> fuel<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:39.960> hands<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.189> I've

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
get diesel fuel on my hands so I've

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
get diesel fuel on my hands so I've
cracked<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.850> open<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.420> half<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.750> turn<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
cracked this open just half a turn and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.640 
cracked this open just half a turn and
now<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> start<00:01:44.970> pumping

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.440 

and<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.159> some<00:01:50.190> bubbles<00:01:50.610> coming<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.300> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and I can see some bubbles coming out of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.430 
and I can see some bubbles coming out of
here<00:01:51.720> mixed<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.680> bit<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.010> fuel<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> I'm

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
here mixed with a bit of fuel so I'm

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.890 
here mixed with a bit of fuel so I'm
just<00:01:55.590> keeping<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> keep<00:01:56.190> pumping<00:01:56.700> until<00:01:56.900> they

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
just keeping a keep pumping until they

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.609 
just keeping a keep pumping until they
get<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.140> steady<00:01:58.500> stream<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:59.100> fuel<00:01:59.400> coming<00:01:59.850> out

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
get a steady stream of fuel coming out

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.960 
get a steady stream of fuel coming out
right<00:02:01.619> I've<00:02:01.830> got<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.010> nice<00:02:02.250> steady<00:02:02.550> stream<00:02:02.940> of

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
right I've got a nice steady stream of

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.999 
right I've got a nice steady stream of
fuel<00:02:03.330> there<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.650> going<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:04.830> do

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
fuel there now so what I'm going to do

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.790 
fuel there now so what I'm going to do
now<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:05.910> pumping<00:02:06.530> we're<00:02:07.530> getting<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
now is as I'm pumping we're getting a

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.460 
now is as I'm pumping we're getting a
nice<00:02:08.009> steady<00:02:08.280> stream<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> fuel<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.600> so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
nice steady stream of fuel out there so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.900 
nice steady stream of fuel out there so
I'm<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.740> to<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.100> wrench<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
I'm going to get the wrench on there and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.560 
I'm going to get the wrench on there and
as<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.150> pump<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.750> I'm<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.570> tighten

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
as I pump down I'm just going to tighten

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
as I pump down I'm just going to tighten
it<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:18.650> there's<00:02:19.650> no<00:02:19.860> chance<00:02:20.130> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it that up so that there's no chance of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.750 
it that up so that there's no chance of
getting<00:02:20.340> air<00:02:20.700> back<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.180> there<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:22.760> sometimes

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
getting air back in there now sometimes

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.850 
getting air back in there now sometimes
if<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.090> fuel<00:02:24.300> system<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.810> completely<00:02:25.290> empty

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
if the fuel system was completely empty

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.100 
if the fuel system was completely empty
we'd<00:02:26.489> have<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.790> crack<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.239> injectors<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:27.989> the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
we'd have to crack the injectors at the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.620 
we'd have to crack the injectors at the
injector<00:02:28.560> pump<00:02:28.800> here<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.970> injectors<00:02:30.480> on

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
injector pump here and the injectors on

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.229 
injector pump here and the injectors on
the<00:02:30.750> engine<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.380> too<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.519> we<00:02:32.640> don't<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the engine here too but we don't have to

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.940 
the engine here too but we don't have to
do<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.600> because<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.230> only<00:02:34.380> changed<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
do that because we only changed the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.729 
do that because we only changed the
primary<00:02:35.459> fuel<00:02:35.730> filter<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.050> know<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.620> this

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
primary fuel filter so I know that this

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.340 
primary fuel filter so I know that this
filter<00:02:38.070> bowl<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.670> will<00:02:38.850> be<00:02:38.970> full<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.300> fuel<00:02:39.600> so

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
filter bowl here will be full of fuel so

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.340 
filter bowl here will be full of fuel so
there's<00:02:40.530> absolutely<00:02:40.739> no<00:02:41.310> need<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.350> as

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
there's absolutely no need to do that as

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.580 
there's absolutely no need to do that as
I<00:02:43.560> said<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.489> were<00:02:45.239> replacing<00:02:46.080> this

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
I said if if we were replacing this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.920 
I said if if we were replacing this
filter<00:02:46.980> -<00:02:47.160> then<00:02:47.430> we'd<00:02:47.580> have<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:48.510> some<00:02:48.750> knees

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
filter - then we'd have to do some knees

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.259 
filter - then we'd have to do some knees
off<00:02:49.170> here<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.310> do<00:02:50.459> exactly<00:02:50.970> what<00:02:51.120> we've

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
off here and we do exactly what we've

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.850 
off here and we do exactly what we've
just<00:02:51.299> done<00:02:51.660> there<00:02:51.930> until<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.290> saw<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> fuel

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
just done there until we saw a fuel

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.090 
just done there until we saw a fuel
bubble<00:02:53.220> out<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.360> we<00:02:54.450> shut<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.720> off

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
bubble out of here then we shut that off

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.470 
bubble out of here then we shut that off
but<00:02:56.100> we<00:02:56.250> should<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.519> good<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> go<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.390> I'm

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
but we should be good to go now so I'm

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.380 
but we should be good to go now so I'm
just<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.780> wipe<00:02:57.959> up<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.290> fuel<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:00.180> we'll

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
just going to wipe up the fuel and we'll

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.910 
just going to wipe up the fuel and we'll
give<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:00.959> see<00:03:01.200> if<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> engine<00:03:01.799> will

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
give it a go and see if the engine will

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.039 
give it a go and see if the engine will
start<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.489> run<00:03:02.640> properly<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:03.900> we're

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
start and run properly right so we're

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.660 
start and run properly right so we're
now<00:03:04.200> back<00:03:04.440> at<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.620> helm<00:03:04.829> we've<00:03:05.040> put<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> deck

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
now back at the helm we've put the deck

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.819 
now back at the helm we've put the deck
back<00:03:05.880> down<00:03:06.180> we<00:03:06.989> cleaned<00:03:07.290> everything<00:03:07.410> up

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
back down we cleaned everything up

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.009 
back down we cleaned everything up
should<00:03:08.549> be<00:03:08.670> good<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.970> go<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.420> we're<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.870> going

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
should be good to go so we're just going

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.479 
should be good to go so we're just going
to<00:03:10.079> run<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> engine<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.160> make<00:03:11.220> sure

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
to run the engine now just to make sure

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:32.179 
to run the engine now just to make sure
everything<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.030> good

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.069 

I've<00:03:33.189> just<00:03:33.400> started<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.849> engine<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.720> sounds

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
I've just started the engine it sounds

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:35.490 
I've just started the engine it sounds
great

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
great

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.740 
great
there's<00:03:35.739> no<00:03:35.890> cost<00:03:36.189> there's<00:03:36.519> no<00:03:36.640> splutters<00:03:37.209> so

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
there's no cost there's no splutters so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.330 
there's no cost there's no splutters so
I<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.439> next<00:03:38.709> time<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:38.980> go<00:03:39.129> out<00:03:39.159> we

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
I think the next time we go out we

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.759 
I think the next time we go out we
should<00:03:39.459> not<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.879> an<00:03:40.000> issue<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.470> didn't

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
should not have an issue so it didn't

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.470 
should not have an issue so it didn't
take<00:03:41.829> me<00:03:42.040> very<00:03:42.069> long<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.939> was<00:03:43.120> very

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
take me very long it was very

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.509 
take me very long it was very
straightforward<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.680> as<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:45.010> said<00:03:45.220> at<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
straightforward and as I said at the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.429 
straightforward and as I said at the
beginning<00:03:45.609> individual<00:03:46.239> video<00:03:46.569> everybody

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
beginning individual video everybody

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.990 
beginning individual video everybody
thinks<00:03:47.769> of<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.920> as<00:03:48.010> some<00:03:48.220> sort<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.459> black<00:03:48.700> art

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
thinks of it as some sort of black art
