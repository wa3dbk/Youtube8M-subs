textures<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.290> them<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
textures you can see them and if you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.559 
textures you can see them and if you
look<00:02:08.220> closely<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.759> dye<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> our

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
look closely the dye you can see the our

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.240 
look closely the dye you can see the our
markers<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> dial

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
markers and you can see that the dial

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.080 
markers and you can see that the dial
itself<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
itself is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.930 
itself is
actually<00:02:12.420> carbon<00:02:12.660> fiber<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:14.519> if<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:14.730> into

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
actually carbon fiber so if you're into

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.430 
actually carbon fiber so if you're into
that<00:02:14.970> look<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.599> black<00:02:15.870> watch<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.379> you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that look of the all black watch and you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.130 
that look of the all black watch and you
want<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.769> that's<00:02:16.860> actually<00:02:17.069> legible<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.959> is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
want one that's actually legible this is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.640 
want one that's actually legible this is
definitely<00:02:19.410> one<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.709> them<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:21.269> terms<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
definitely one of them in terms of the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.460 
definitely one of them in terms of the
features<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.000> dial<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.379> just

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
features on the dial it's just it's just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.830 
features on the dial it's just it's just
the<00:02:25.650> time<00:02:25.950> does<00:02:26.819> not<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.390> date<00:02:27.569> but<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the time does not have the date but it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
the time does not have the date but it
has<00:02:27.989> something<00:02:28.319> really<00:02:28.620> cool<00:02:28.830> which<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.580> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
has something really cool which is a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.570 
has something really cool which is a
series<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.180> lights<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.470> base<00:02:31.680> movement<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
series of lights so the base movement of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.690 
series of lights so the base movement of
this<00:02:32.819> watch<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.260> believe<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.099> Japanese

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
this watch is I believe it's Japanese

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.380 
this watch is I believe it's Japanese
quartz<00:02:36.060> movement<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.819> that's<00:02:38.819> powered<00:02:39.239> by<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
quartz movement and that's powered by a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.970 
quartz movement and that's powered by a
battery<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.290> quartz<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:40.769> there's<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
battery of this quartz now there's a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.850 
battery of this quartz now there's a
separate<00:02:41.519> battery<00:02:41.790> which<00:02:42.480> powers<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:43.170> series

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
separate battery which powers a series

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.650 
separate battery which powers a series
of<00:02:43.890> lights<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.030> don't<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.299> this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> look

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
of lights so I don't know this is a look

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.009 
of lights so I don't know this is a look
like<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.840> video<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.329> that's<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.450> blue<00:02:48.750> light

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
like on video but so that's a blue light

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.110 
like on video but so that's a blue light
and<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:51.269> looks<00:02:51.750> really<00:02:52.079> cool<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:53.849> video

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
and it looks really cool in the video

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.550 
and it looks really cool in the video
and<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.569> probably<00:02:54.750> looks<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.230> cool<00:02:55.410> my

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and it probably looks really cool my

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.350 
and it probably looks really cool my
wrist<00:02:55.769> these<00:02:56.220> blue<00:02:56.549> lights<00:02:56.760> are<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> would

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
wrist these blue lights are what I would

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.440 
wrist these blue lights are what I would
call<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.959> back<00:02:58.319> lights<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.120> as<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.360> can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
call the back lights and you as you can

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030 
call the back lights and you as you can
see<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:00.959> hold<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.319> thing<00:03:01.530> down<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> think

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
see you can hold the thing down I think

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.430 
see you can hold the thing down I think
they<00:03:02.280> stay<00:03:02.489> up<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.819> little<00:03:03.030> while<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.840> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
they stay up for a little while but that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.380 
they stay up for a little while but that
lets<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.799> read<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.489> bright<00:03:05.819> okay

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
lets you read it and I it's bright okay

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.069 
lets you read it and I it's bright okay
so<00:03:07.079> you<00:03:07.140> push<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.530> again<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.610> have<00:03:09.079> three

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
so you push it again and you have three

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.800 
so you push it again and you have three
other<00:03:10.379> LEDs<00:03:11.190> white<00:03:11.610> LEDs<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.629> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
other LEDs white LEDs and this is like a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.199 
other LEDs white LEDs and this is like a
flashlight<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.560> I'm<00:03:14.400> not<00:03:14.610> kidding<00:03:14.819> these<00:03:15.060> are

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
flashlight and I'm not kidding these are

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.430 
flashlight and I'm not kidding these are
pretty<00:03:15.390> bright<00:03:15.690> I'm<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:16.019> saying<00:03:16.290> you're

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
pretty bright I'm not saying you're

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.539 
pretty bright I'm not saying you're
gonna<00:03:16.500> like<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.829> light<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.160> an<00:03:17.280> entire

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
gonna like the light up an entire

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.400 
gonna like the light up an entire
building<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.269> you're<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.600> somewhere

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
building but if you're like somewhere

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.050 
building but if you're like somewhere
you<00:03:19.590> want<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.829> see<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.100> ground<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.880> thing

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you want to see the ground and the thing

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.879 
you want to see the ground and the thing
is<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.359> stays<00:03:21.630> on<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.049> mode<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.410> stays<00:03:22.680> on

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
is it stays on this mode it stays on

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.979 
is it stays on this mode it stays on
okay<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.120> push<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.480> again<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.930> they

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
okay and you push it again and they

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.140 
okay and you push it again and they
blink<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.530> like<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> strobe<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.060> an

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
blink it's like a strobe so it's like an

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.550 
blink it's like a strobe so it's like an
emergency<00:03:27.389> thing<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.200> like<00:03:28.349> wave

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
emergency thing so you can like wave

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.640 
emergency thing so you can like wave
your<00:03:28.769> hand<00:03:28.980> around<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.000> don't<00:03:30.120> know<00:03:30.329> and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
your hand around and I don't know and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.830 
your hand around and I don't know and
then<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:32.220> blue<00:03:32.370> one<00:03:32.400> again<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.269> says<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.690> has

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
then the blue one again it says it has

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.379 
then the blue one again it says it has
five<00:03:34.500> modes<00:03:34.920> maybe<00:03:35.549> I'm<00:03:35.760> missing<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
five modes maybe I'm missing but the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.720 
five modes maybe I'm missing but the
five<00:03:36.599> modes<00:03:36.959> are<00:03:37.230> but<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:37.889> me<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.160> blue<00:03:38.430> on

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
five modes are but for me it's blue on

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.349 
five modes are but for me it's blue on
and<00:03:39.540> then<00:03:39.660> stroke<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.609> other<00:03:41.790> couple

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
and then stroke so the other couple

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.170 
and then stroke so the other couple
modes<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.989> don't<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:44.010> have<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.970> read<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
modes I don't know I have to read the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.569 
modes I don't know I have to read the
manual<00:03:45.540> maybe<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.680> then<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.310> know<00:03:47.430> those

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
manual maybe and then you know those

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.280 
manual maybe and then you know those
were<00:03:47.700> activated<00:03:48.269> by<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.389> other<00:03:48.630> pusher<00:03:49.109> and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
were activated by this other pusher and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.800 
were activated by this other pusher and
it<00:03:49.650> has<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.799> protector<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.639> if<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.880> screw<00:03:51.660> down

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
it has a protector so if you screw down

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.930 
it has a protector so if you screw down
the<00:03:51.870> protector<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.919> can't<00:03:53.160> activate<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.730> and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
the protector you can't activate it and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.180 
the protector you can't activate it and
then<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.660> screw<00:03:54.930> up<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.230> protector<00:03:55.709> then<00:03:56.040> you

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
then you screw up the protector then you

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.710 
then you screw up the protector then you
can<00:03:56.340> push<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.760> pusher<00:03:57.060> down<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.510> that's<00:03:57.630> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
can push the pusher down and that's a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.720 
can push the pusher down and that's a
good<00:03:57.870> way<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.019> saving<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> battery<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.489> what

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
good way of saving the battery so what

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.970 
good way of saving the battery so what
MTM<00:04:00.239> does<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:00.989> they<00:04:01.319> throw<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:03.410> an<00:04:04.410> induction

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
MTM does is they throw in a an induction

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.330 
MTM does is they throw in a an induction
charger<00:04:05.669> so<00:04:06.359> you<00:04:06.419> have<00:04:06.569> this<00:04:06.660> base<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:08.099> plugs

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
charger so you have this base it plugs

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.280 
charger so you have this base it plugs
in<00:04:08.639> and<00:04:09.030> then<00:04:09.359> you<00:04:09.480> sit<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> watch<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
in and then you sit the watch on the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.319 
in and then you sit the watch on the
space<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.919> guess<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.370> other<00:04:11.519> mode<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> blue

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
space I guess the other mode is the blue

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.420 
space I guess the other mode is the blue
light<00:04:12.540> can<00:04:12.720> stay<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.139> rather<00:04:13.440> than<00:04:13.680> come<00:04:14.010> on

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
light can stay on rather than come on

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.409 
light can stay on rather than come on
so<00:04:15.269> then<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.599> stick<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:15.959> on<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:17.419> if

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
so then you stick it on like that and if

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.620 
so then you stick it on like that and if
that<00:04:18.660> charges<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that charges the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.240 
that charges the
the<00:04:20.840> second<00:04:21.290> battery<00:04:21.680> there's<00:04:21.920> something<00:04:22.160> I

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
the second battery there's something I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.980 
the second battery there's something I
think<00:04:22.400> there's<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.730> lithium-ion<00:04:23.210> battery<00:04:23.240> and

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
think there's a lithium-ion battery and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.330 
think there's a lithium-ion battery and
the<00:04:24.320> good<00:04:24.470> thing<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.800> might<00:04:24.890> like<00:04:25.130> plug

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
the good thing is you might like plug

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.220 
the good thing is you might like plug
and<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.580> stay<00:04:25.790> on<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.030> base<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.990> charges

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
and you stay on the base and it charges

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.210 
and you stay on the base and it charges
for<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> little<00:04:27.830> while

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
for a little while

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.330 
for a little while
not<00:04:28.700> really<00:04:28.940> exactly<00:04:29.360> how<00:04:29.690> sure<00:04:30.380> how<00:04:30.620> long<00:04:30.890> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
not really exactly how sure how long the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.040 
not really exactly how sure how long the
battery<00:04:31.640> lasts<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.120> guess<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.390> depends<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.870> how

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
battery lasts I guess it depends on how

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.240 
battery lasts I guess it depends on how
much<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.410> use<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.890> but<00:04:35.620> I'd<00:04:36.620> say<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:37.100> you're

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
much you use it but I'd say that you're

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.350 
much you use it but I'd say that you're
good<00:04:37.430> for<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.640> couple<00:04:38.030> weeks

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
good for a couple weeks

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.300 
good for a couple weeks
LEDs<00:04:38.810> are<00:04:38.840> really<00:04:39.320> good<00:04:39.560> what's<00:04:39.800> not<00:04:39.950> using

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
LEDs are really good what's not using

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.880 
LEDs are really good what's not using
too<00:04:41.180> too<00:04:41.450> much<00:04:41.690> power<00:04:41.960> although<00:04:42.350> they<00:04:42.500> can<00:04:42.740> use

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
too too much power although they can use

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.950 
too too much power although they can use
a<00:04:42.920> lot<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.190> their<00:04:43.460> bright<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.240> since<00:04:44.720> it's<00:04:44.870> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
a lot of their bright and since it's a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.660 
a lot of their bright and since it's a

separate battery which isn't related to

separate battery which isn't related to
the<00:04:46.820> timekeeping<00:04:47.450> function<00:04:47.960> that's<00:04:48.440> really

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
the timekeeping function that's really

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.650 
the timekeeping function that's really
really<00:04:48.920> good<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.760> forgot<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.330> mention<00:04:50.450> that

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
really good I forgot to mention that

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.130 
really good I forgot to mention that
there<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.370> rotating<00:04:52.370> divers<00:04:53.360> style<00:04:53.660> bezel

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
there is a rotating divers style bezel

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.230 
there is a rotating divers style bezel
there<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:54.590> those<00:04:54.890> are<00:04:54.980> nice<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.280> have<00:04:55.460> I'm<00:04:56.210> a

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
big fan of rotating bezels basically

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.200 
big fan of rotating bezels basically
like<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.860> think<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.400> must<00:05:01.610> unlike<00:05:01.940> many

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
like I think it's a must unlike many
