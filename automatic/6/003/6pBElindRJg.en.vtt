00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
they've done I mean is the fast forward

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
they've done I mean is the fast forward
a<00:00:40.020> year<00:00:40.050> they've<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> had<00:00:41.370> trials

the ball moves he's just going and so
that's<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> most<00:01:33.060> evident<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.869> watch<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that's the most evident is you watch a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.630 
that's the most evident is you watch a
play<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:34.500> he's<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.890> insignificant<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
play where he's really insignificant to

play where he's really insignificant to
the<00:01:35.729> play<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> speed<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.049> he

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the play but just the speed at which he

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
the play but just the speed at which he
goes<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> effort<00:01:38.670> he<00:01:38.759> gives<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.450> you

really<00:03:06.360> taken<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.810> bigger<00:03:07.049> step<00:03:07.440> Zack<00:03:08.250> there

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
really taken a bigger step Zack there

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.009 
really taken a bigger step Zack there
was<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:08.640> much<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> focus<00:03:09.329> on<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> receivers<00:03:09.900> a

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
was so much for focus on the receivers a

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.210 
was so much for focus on the receivers a
year<00:03:10.200> ago<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> lot<00:03:10.769> easier<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
year ago it's a lot easier to be the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100 
year ago it's a lot easier to be the
receivers<00:03:11.610> coach<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.030> year<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.690> wasn't<00:03:13.079> your

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
receivers coach this year it wasn't your

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.660 
receivers coach this year it wasn't your
God<00:03:13.380> oh<00:03:15.560> yeah<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> mean<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.950> wouldn't<00:03:17.579> say

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
God oh yeah I mean I I wouldn't say

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.090 
God oh yeah I mean I I wouldn't say
easier<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.450> it's<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:19.650> feel<00:03:19.890> more

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
easier but it's it's you feel more

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
easier but it's it's you feel more
rewarded<00:03:20.670> because<00:03:20.850> you're<00:03:21.570> seeing<00:03:21.959> what

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
rewarded because you're seeing what

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.840 
rewarded because you're seeing what
you're<00:03:22.410> trying<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> get<00:03:22.829> done<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.609> think

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
you're trying to get done and I think

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.430 
you're trying to get done and I think
it's<00:03:23.970> been<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> long<00:03:24.420> process<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.019> it's<00:03:25.290> not

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
it's been a long process and it's not

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.140 
it's been a long process and it's not
something<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.940> could<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.030> happened

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
something that could have happened

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.240 
something that could have happened
overnight<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.019> think<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.859> where<00:03:29.070> we're

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
overnight and I think that where we're

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.090 
overnight and I think that where we're
at<00:03:29.280> right<00:03:29.549> now<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:30.090> okay<00:03:31.019> we've<00:03:31.350> taken<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.829> step

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
at right now is okay we've taken a step

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.000 
at right now is okay we've taken a step
we're<00:03:32.400> no<00:03:32.609> longer<00:03:32.989> dysfunctional<00:03:33.989> now<00:03:34.709> let's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
we're no longer dysfunctional now let's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.400 
we're no longer dysfunctional now let's
really<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> best<00:03:36.390> receiver<00:03:36.690> unit<00:03:37.140> in

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
really go be the best receiver unit in

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.050 
really go be the best receiver unit in
the<00:03:37.500> country<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.340> that's<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.700> next<00:03:38.820> step

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the country and so that's the next step

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.050 
the country and so that's the next step
we<00:03:39.269> have<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.510> take<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.079> consistent

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
we have to take is the consistent

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.819 
we have to take is the consistent
domination<00:03:42.060> as<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.299> group<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.470> when<00:03:43.680> we

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
domination as a group and so when we

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.979 
domination as a group and so when we
take<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.250> step<00:03:44.640> I'll<00:03:44.940> be<00:03:45.420> really<00:03:45.720> pleased

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
take that step I'll be really pleased

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.319 
take that step I'll be really pleased
look<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.859> it's<00:03:47.489> not<00:03:47.549> good<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.030> said<00:03:48.209> what

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
look in it it's not good I said what

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.670 
look in it it's not good I said what
kind<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.480> things<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.930> seek<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.500> take

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
kind of things you have to seek to take

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.890 
kind of things you have to seek to take
that<00:03:49.799> next<00:03:49.950> step<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.940> consistency<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.660> mean

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that next step I just consistency I mean
