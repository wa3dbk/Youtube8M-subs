00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.009 

I<00:00:05.279> thought<00:00:06.279> it<00:00:06.430> would<00:00:06.490> take<00:00:06.550> the<00:00:07.029> opportunity

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019 
I thought it would take the opportunity

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.680 
I thought it would take the opportunity
to<00:00:08.320> add<00:00:08.559> in<00:00:08.769> a<00:00:08.889> video<00:00:09.010> of<00:00:09.429> course<00:00:10.059> stability

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
to add in a video of course stability

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.600 
to add in a video of course stability
exercises<00:00:11.290> I<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:13.269> these<00:00:14.010> pretty<00:00:15.010> much<00:00:15.220> every

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
exercises I do these pretty much every

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.700 
exercises I do these pretty much every
day<00:00:16.289> sometimes<00:00:17.289> we'll<00:00:18.160> do<00:00:18.369> them<00:00:18.550> in<00:00:19.079> single

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.109 

15-minute<00:00:23.710> sessions<00:00:23.980> in<00:00:24.489> which<00:00:24.730> case<00:00:24.970> you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
15-minute sessions in which case you

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.120 
15-minute sessions in which case you
would<00:00:25.720> do<00:00:25.839> three<00:00:26.140> sets<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.710> all<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:27.009> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
would do three sets of all of the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.649 
would do three sets of all of the
exercises<00:00:28.439> sometimes<00:00:29.439> I<00:00:29.739> will<00:00:30.069> do<00:00:30.659> the

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:31.659 
exercises sometimes I will do the

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.280 
exercises sometimes I will do the
exercises<00:00:32.169> in<00:00:32.649> five<00:00:33.220> minute<00:00:33.780> sessions<00:00:34.780> and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
exercises in five minute sessions and

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.990 
exercises in five minute sessions and
maybe<00:00:35.470> do<00:00:35.649> them<00:00:35.829> three<00:00:36.160> times<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.730> day<00:00:36.850> it

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
maybe do them three times in the day it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.459 
maybe do them three times in the day it
just<00:00:37.180> depends<00:00:37.539> on<00:00:37.600> how<00:00:37.780> much<00:00:37.960> time<00:00:38.289> you<00:00:38.440> have

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
just depends on how much time you have

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.959 
just depends on how much time you have
to<00:00:38.949> go<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:40.000> pass<00:00:40.890> no<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.010> first<00:00:42.160> exercise<00:00:42.730> was

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
to go to pass no the first exercise was

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.590 
to go to pass no the first exercise was
the<00:00:43.120> plank<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.789> a<00:00:45.940> fairly<00:00:46.210> static

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
the plank that's a fairly static

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.880 
the plank that's a fairly static
exercise<00:00:48.629> works<00:00:49.629> mostly<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.260> anterior

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
exercise works mostly the anterior

00:00:50.890 --> 00:01:00.840 
exercise works mostly the anterior
muscles<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:57.100> second<00:00:57.550> one<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:59.519> single<00:01:00.519> leg

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
muscles the second one is a single leg

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.110 
muscles the second one is a single leg
plank<00:01:01.679> and<00:01:02.679> single<00:01:03.100> leg<00:01:03.219> plank<00:01:03.519> with<00:01:03.789> our<00:01:03.940> ears

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
plank and single leg plank with our ears

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.250 
plank and single leg plank with our ears
now<00:01:04.480> as<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.740> can<00:01:05.830> see<00:01:05.890> with<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.490> exercise<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
now as you can see with this exercise it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.770 
now as you can see with this exercise it
looks<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.740> little<00:01:08.920> bit<00:01:09.160> more<00:01:09.340> shaky<00:01:09.820> than<00:01:10.030> on

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
looks a little bit more shaky than on

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.020 
looks a little bit more shaky than on
the<00:01:11.140> right-hand<00:01:11.680> side<00:01:11.800> that's<00:01:12.610> because<00:01:12.910> the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
the right-hand side that's because the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.480 
the right-hand side that's because the
left<00:01:13.270> hand<00:01:13.510> side<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:13.990> operator<00:01:14.470> leg<00:01:14.800> so

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
left hand side is the operator leg so

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.890 
left hand side is the operator leg so
it's<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.670> little<00:01:15.790> bit<00:01:15.970> more<00:01:16.120> difficult<00:01:16.660> for

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
it's a little bit more difficult for

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's a little bit more difficult for
that<00:01:17.380> leg<00:01:20.520> moving<00:01:21.520> on<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.270> next<00:01:22.450> exercise<00:01:23.290> is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
that leg moving on the next exercise is

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.580 
that leg moving on the next exercise is
a<00:01:23.560> bridging<00:01:23.980> exercise<00:01:24.420> which<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.450> keep<00:01:26.440> your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
a bridging exercise which you keep your

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.010 
a bridging exercise which you keep your
feet<00:01:26.800> on<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.160> bed<00:01:27.370> or<00:01:27.910> on<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.030> floor<00:01:28.120> and

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
feet on the bed or on the floor and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.060 
feet on the bed or on the floor and
raise<00:01:29.260> your<00:01:29.470> bomb<00:01:29.650> so<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.640> have<00:01:31.030> your

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
raise your bomb so that you have your

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.360 
raise your bomb so that you have your
abdomen<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.310> legs<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.850> alignment

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
abdomen and legs in alignment

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.640 
abdomen and legs in alignment
hold<00:01:36.370> this<00:01:36.550> for<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> few<00:01:37.090> seconds<00:01:37.600> then<00:01:38.350> move

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
hold this for a few seconds then move

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.880 
hold this for a few seconds then move
into<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:39.010> strip<00:01:39.490> like<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:40.210> single<00:01:40.810> leg<00:01:41.110> bridging

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
into a strip like a single leg bridging

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.730 
into a strip like a single leg bridging
exercise<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.940> make<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.240> more<00:01:46.510> difficult

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
exercise to make this more difficult

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.360 
exercise to make this more difficult
move<00:01:47.820> into<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:49.090> more<00:01:49.300> active<00:01:50.130> single<00:01:51.130> leg

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
move into a more active single leg

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.630 
move into a more active single leg
bridging<00:01:52.350> were<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.530> using<00:01:53.800> your<00:01:54.100> glutes<00:01:54.460> and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
bridging were you using your glutes and

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.880 
bridging were you using your glutes and
your<00:01:54.730> hamstrings<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.570> your<00:01:55.720> right<00:01:55.870> leg<00:01:56.110> and

your hamstrings on your right leg and
you're<00:01:57.130> using<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.550> hip<00:01:57.730> flexor<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.450> little<00:01:58.930> bit

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
you're using the hip flexor a little bit

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.830 
you're using the hip flexor a little bit
on<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.380> left<00:01:59.530> leg<00:01:59.830> to<00:02:00.040> keep<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.400> stable<00:02:00.850> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
on the left leg to keep it stable and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.760 
on the left leg to keep it stable and
and<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.710> abdominals<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:03.340> well<00:02:03.370> another<00:02:03.790> end

and the abdominals as well another end
on<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:05.890> side<00:02:08.280> change<00:02:09.280> over<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.789> other

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
on that side change over to the other

on that side change over to the other
side

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
side

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.780 
side
and<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:10.869> will<00:02:10.989> see<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.440> on<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.800> site<00:02:12.070> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and you will see that on this site it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.840 
and you will see that on this site it
looks<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:13.090> lot<00:02:13.270> more<00:02:13.420> shaky<00:02:14.520> that's<00:02:15.520> because

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
looks a lot more shaky that's because

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.790 
looks a lot more shaky that's because
there

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
there

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.090 
there
operated<00:02:17.670> leg<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.260> taking<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> string<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
operated leg is now taking the string to

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.090 
operated leg is now taking the string to
keep<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.780> pelvis<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.650> bed

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
keep the pelvis up off the bed

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.360 
keep the pelvis up off the bed
and<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> see<00:02:24.060> there's<00:02:24.240> more<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.720> band<00:02:25.370> so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and you see there's more of a band so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.400 
and you see there's more of a band so
it's<00:02:26.520> all<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:26.910> form<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.510> control<00:02:27.960> doing

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
it's all about form and control doing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.920 
it's all about form and control doing
this<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> will<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.610> difficult<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.300> you'll

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
this and it will be difficult and you'll

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
this and it will be difficult and you'll
find<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.290> lot<00:02:31.410> harder<00:02:31.710> on<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:33.120> operator

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
find a lot harder on on the operator

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
find a lot harder on on the operator
site<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.380> other<00:02:34.590> than<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.980> on

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
site and there right other than the on
