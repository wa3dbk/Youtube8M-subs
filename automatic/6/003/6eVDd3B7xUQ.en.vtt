00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.870 
going to be put to the sword here and
once<00:00:10.170> they've<00:00:10.380> overhauled<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.340> New<00:00:11.490> Zealand

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
and that could set them off at trying to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.250 
and that could set them off at trying to
lower<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.949> season's<00:00:17.430> best<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.880> 356<00:00:18.660> it'd<00:00:19.080> be

to the line now let's have a look at

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
to the line now let's have a look at
this<00:01:05.280> guillotine<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.909> split<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:07.020> 3.4

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this guillotine to split one over 3.4

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
this guillotine to split one over 3.4
not<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.490> quick<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> world<00:01:09.149> record<00:01:09.600> but

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
not as quick as the world record but

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.540 
not as quick as the world record but
this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> fast<00:01:10.409> well<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.800> think<00:01:10.979> they're<00:01:11.399> on<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
this is fast well I think they're on a

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.090 
this is fast well I think they're on a
55<00:01:12.179> schedule<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:13.050> my<00:01:13.259> guess<00:01:13.319> and<00:01:13.800> if<00:01:13.979> they

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
55 schedule that's my guess and if they

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.710 
55 schedule that's my guess and if they
want<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> shot<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.149> that<00:01:15.179> world<00:01:15.600> title

want to have a shot at that world title

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.139 
want to have a shot at that world title
it<00:01:16.110> isn't<00:01:16.380> super<00:01:16.710> hot<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.069> we<00:01:17.190> said<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.850> need

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
it isn't super hot as we said they need
