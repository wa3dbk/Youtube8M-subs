00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone with you dmitry carters all 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.020
 happy new year 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.380
 winter december recently in time by 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.160
 rules of the road populated 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.750
 paragraph including and must travel with 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.400
 turn on the light up on the car 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:30.380
 near buildings turn on well of course closer 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.380
 so we made a simple decision 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.160
 so that the battery doesn't run up to us 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 usually dramas by day especially because on 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.270
 dream night and day to day, we export 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 out of the car and forget to turn off the lights for 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.160
 here show yes I will demonstrate the plant with 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.610
 the main switch yes we turn it on 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 the light is on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.019
 we start the car yes and yes we go 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.010
 lights will be on 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:13.580
 now it means we have come to key 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:18.290
 pulled out all gone let's show 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.780
 will stay with us too not to 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.650
 marker lights we will remain on 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.510
 front and rear so that we do not sit down 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.900
 the battery we found the simplest 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:38.210
 a decision without much alteration in principle 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.540
 no type remaking no we set yet 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.660
 one additional switch here such 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.660
 that's under the fog 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.479
 what he does he plus he just 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.400
 breaks the constant plus that goes 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.369
 on the size of our food that is because 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.420
 and now included dimensions yes if we 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.070
 so here we turn it off all 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.070
 dimensions went out accordingly 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.150
 the battery already sits will not be exactly 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.540
 we can even if we come here 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.540
 cars 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:28.849
 we drive this headlight here 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:31.790
 now the headlights are turned on we 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:37.239
 wound up and go this toggle switch should 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.189
 now always be on remember 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.109
 but in order not to have a battery, we 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.969
 Here they put in a gap 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:55.579
 additional switch it is with us 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:59.510
 breaks the positive wire to the size well 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:02.419
 in principle, that's the whole scheme yes how are we 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.010
 did get it done like it means 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:09.939
 did not find the positive wire this is extremely yes 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.939
 he was here at this place red then 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:18.109
 we pulled hooked here and here 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:20.449
 this additional our toggle switch and the second 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.729
 the output of this toggle switch hooked here on 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.479
 this place is red everything is simple with us 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:30.169
 somehow black began to break the food 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:32.949
 well, this is a simple scheme but the most 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:37.819
 the simple solution is to have you 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:39.739
 The battery did not sit down, that is, you have days 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:46.239
 there will be such a position 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:49.340
 enabled and this self will be disabled 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.030
 to turn it on so I went to see 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.030
 consumption 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:02.560
 that's the principle and the whole scheme is ok 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.440
 no complicated but of course we ourselves will 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.000
 make it a temporary solution to give 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.980
 you will do a little bit different as the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.870
 I need to take another video with 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:22.750
 detailed description 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:26.350
 how what and where we did well in general here 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.150
 such a small big perry 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.770
 girl rather to add 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.150
 we only needed one 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.850
 and a fuel ate wires from one 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.710
 here to switch color from one block to 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.470
 another pads literally small 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:52.080
 the length of the two sides on the factory volume 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:56.919
 where my just put the principle and all 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:01.400
 good luck to all all again with the upcoming 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:04.669
 new year to 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.750
 next year everything was all nothing 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.740
 not sick but follow the rules of the road 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.220
 movements 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.970
 it is at least your safety well and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:22.070
 plus of course saving your money 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.840
 because the fines are big now 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.320
 such a small refinement will help 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.740
 you avoid like u say your 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.720
 battery does not let you down yes and 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.240
 discharge to forget 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.180
 turn the lights off 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.639
 but good luck everyone, see my video 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.410
 put a class subscribe to my 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.410
 channel necessarily all good luck
