00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
have a third one you got to have a first

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.850 
have a third one you got to have a first
and<00:03:15.530> second<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:17.090> there<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.660> Paul<00:03:17.930> speaks

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
and second one so there if Paul speaks

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.280 
and second one so there if Paul speaks
of<00:03:19.010> God's<00:03:19.430> throne<00:03:19.700> as<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.300> third<00:03:21.019> heaven

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
of God's throne as the third heaven

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.850 
of God's throne as the third heaven
there<00:03:21.920> has<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.340> be<00:03:22.370> lower<00:03:22.820> heavens<00:03:23.390> than<00:03:23.570> that

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
there has to be lower heavens than that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.979 
there has to be lower heavens than that
so<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:24.890> believe<00:03:25.580> Paul<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.209> referring<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.690> what

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
so I believe Paul is referring to what

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.680 
so I believe Paul is referring to what
is<00:03:27.110> called<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.470> second<00:03:28.040> heaven<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.519> he<00:03:29.330> calls

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
is called the second heaven and he calls

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.920 
is called the second heaven and he calls
them<00:03:30.080> heavenly<00:03:31.040> realms<00:03:31.850> notice<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.480> he<00:03:32.750> did

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
them heavenly realms notice that he did

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.770 
them heavenly realms notice that he did
not<00:03:33.080> say<00:03:33.410> we<00:03:34.190> war<00:03:34.489> against<00:03:35.030> these<00:03:35.180> spirits<00:03:35.660> are

demons are not winged creatures at all
they're<00:04:12.799> just<00:04:12.830> disembodied<00:04:13.760> spirits<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.440> they

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
they're just disembodied spirits so they

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.650 
they're just disembodied spirits so they
operate<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.130> different<00:04:16.250> realms<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:16.850> like<00:04:17.510> to

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
operate in different realms I like to

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.380 
operate in different realms I like to
describe<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:18.140> this<00:04:18.260> way<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:19.609> our<00:04:19.790> military<00:04:20.000> we

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
describe it this way in our military we

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.210 
describe it this way in our military we
have<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.690> army<00:04:21.140> ground<00:04:21.440> troops<00:04:21.770> and<00:04:22.010> then<00:04:22.100> we

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
have the army ground troops and then we

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.460 
have the army ground troops and then we
have<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.580> Air<00:04:22.760> Force

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
have the Air Force

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.990 
have the Air Force
now<00:04:25.470> which<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.740> more<00:04:26.010> powerful<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.580> air<00:04:26.700> force

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
now which is more powerful the air force

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.510 
now which is more powerful the air force
of<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> ground<00:04:27.450> troops<00:04:28.010> well<00:04:29.010> we<00:04:29.160> all<00:04:29.280> know

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
of the ground troops well we all know

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.150 
of the ground troops well we all know
that<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.630> air<00:04:30.810> force<00:04:31.170> is<00:04:31.350> always<00:04:31.590> more

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
that that the air force is always more

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.530 
that that the air force is always more
powerful<00:04:32.610> than<00:04:32.700> anyone<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.270> ground

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
powerful than anyone on the ground

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.570 
powerful than anyone on the ground
because<00:04:33.990> there<00:04:34.170> are<00:04:34.290> over<00:04:34.740> them<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.250> they're

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
because there are over them and they're

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.490 
because there are over them and they're

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
very little that the ground troops can

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.790 
very little that the ground troops can
do<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.230> these<00:04:40.380> fighter<00:04:40.620> jets<00:04:42.050> now<00:04:43.050> fallen

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
interesting he actually uses the term

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.210 
interesting he actually uses the term
the<00:04:49.530> spiritual<00:04:50.190> forces<00:04:50.990> not<00:04:51.990> army<00:04:52.440> but

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
the spiritual forces not army but

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
realms so they are actually the air

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.440 
realms so they are actually the air
force<00:04:58.380> fallen<00:04:58.830> angels<00:04:59.160> are<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> Air<00:04:59.670> Force<00:05:00.210> of

able<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:12.150> control<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.570> certain<00:05:13.020> air<00:05:13.140> that<00:05:13.380> when

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
able to control a certain air that when

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.530

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
they try to control an air they do it to

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.960 
they try to control an air they do it to
provide<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.170> ground<00:05:16.470> troops<00:05:16.830> demons<00:05:17.550> the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
provide the ground troops demons the

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.200 
provide the ground troops demons the
ability<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.660> control<00:05:19.020> people's<00:05:19.440> lives

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
alright so basically that's the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.620 
alright so basically that's the
difference<00:05:22.950> demons<00:05:23.580> would<00:05:23.700> be<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.360> true

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
difference demons would be the true

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.200 
difference demons would be the true
ground<00:05:24.960> troops<00:05:25.320> while<00:05:25.860> fallen<00:05:26.280> angels<00:05:26.670> would

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
ground troops while fallen angels would

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.470 
ground troops while fallen angels would
be<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.480> Air<00:05:27.630> Force<00:05:27.990> does<00:05:28.170> that<00:05:28.290> make<00:05:28.440> sense
