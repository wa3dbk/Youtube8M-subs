it's<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.159> defective<00:01:40.610> parts<00:01:40.880> per<00:01:40.970> million

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
it's a defective parts per million

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.149 
it's a defective parts per million

on by a lot of relationship buildings
but<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.610> think<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.720> elements<00:04:42.680> that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
but I think that the the elements that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.740 
but I think that the the elements that
build<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.280> strategic<00:04:43.880> partnership<00:04:44.510> our

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.969 
build the strategic partnership our
first<00:04:45.289> of<00:04:45.440> all<00:04:45.560> friendship<00:04:46.479> seconds<00:04:47.479> trust

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
first of all friendship seconds trust

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.100 
first of all friendship seconds trust
the<00:04:48.979> third<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.400> commitment<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.870> fourth

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
the third is commitment and the fourth

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.060 
the third is commitment and the fourth
is<00:04:51.320> flexibility<00:04:52.419> now<00:04:53.440> friendships<00:04:54.440> are<00:04:54.620> not

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
is flexibility now friendships are not

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.890 
is flexibility now friendships are not
made<00:04:55.370> they're<00:04:55.639> built<00:04:55.880> we<00:04:56.510> feel<00:04:56.750> the

made they're built we feel the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.990 
made they're built we feel the
relationship<00:04:57.590> with<00:04:57.740> my<00:04:58.460> knee<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.760> at<00:04:58.909> the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
relationship with my knee is at the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000 
relationship with my knee is at the
highest<00:04:59.150> level<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.630> our<00:04:59.780> company<00:05:00.199> so<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.860> was<00:05:00.979> a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
highest level of our company so it was a

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.170 
highest level of our company so it was a
very<00:05:01.210> very<00:05:03.250> trusting<00:05:04.250> relationship<00:05:04.909> that<00:05:05.060> was

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
very very trusting relationship that was

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.110 
very very trusting relationship that was
built<00:05:05.419> on<00:05:05.539> either<00:05:05.870> eaten<00:05:06.590> nor<00:05:07.010> my<00:05:07.669> knee<00:05:07.729> would

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
built on either eaten nor my knee would

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.659 
built on either eaten nor my knee would
ever<00:05:08.300> have<00:05:08.949> conceived<00:05:09.949> that<00:05:10.190> some<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.550> these

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
ever have conceived that some of these

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.430 
ever have conceived that some of these
problems<00:05:10.970> would<00:05:11.360> arise<00:05:11.389> but<00:05:11.870> they<00:05:12.020> did<00:05:12.229> and

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
problems would arise but they did and

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.879 
problems would arise but they did and
and<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:13.580> what<00:05:14.389> rather<00:05:14.690> than<00:05:14.960> what<00:05:15.620> fighting

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
and so what rather than what fighting

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.180 
and so what rather than what fighting
about<00:05:16.220> them<00:05:16.520> we<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.479> really<00:05:17.930> work<00:05:18.500> together<00:05:18.710> to

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
about them we we really work together to

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.000 
about them we we really work together to
solve<00:05:19.370> these<00:05:19.580> issues<00:05:19.639> and<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.780> think<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.320> for

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
solve these issues and I think that for

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.940 
solve these issues and I think that for
both<00:05:22.300> viney<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.659> eaten<00:05:24.289> we've<00:05:24.830> held<00:05:25.099> this
