00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.240
 there are moments that you have left in the 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.710
 memory forever like the first day 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.710
 that you take your son to school 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.470
 I would never forget 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.960
 to stay there and to me as a kid I spent 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.090
 I had loved the exact same thing 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.890
 that just stay with me those 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.980
 first days of school but 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.949
 obviously it is impossible together 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.199
 we generate a secret a secret that to me 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.010
 it made me feel very good and it was that 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.370
 we prepared during the afternoon 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.399
 the recipe for my favorite lot that is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.649
 it's just tuna croquettes with 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 Munitions soup and mango dir 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.469
 you need manila oat oil mango 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.769
 ground honey honey wheat flour 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.570
 tuna in water ammo the modern juice of 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.570
 lemon carrot and egg 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.820
 and it was just like the next day in 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.220
 the moment of which I no longer felt 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.460
 I just felt that my mom was there 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460
 with me 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 that's why now as father of 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.870
 family and as a chef I understand 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.060
 perfectly to all the moms who 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.060
 they want to be present at all times 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.360
 all right 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.080
 I give it that way 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.159
 to me
