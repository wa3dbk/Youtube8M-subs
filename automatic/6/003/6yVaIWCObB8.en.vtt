00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
so uh yeah that's how to make the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.770

diamond<00:02:45.190> leggings<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.450> said<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.750> can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
diamond leggings and like I said you can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.240 
diamond leggings and like I said you can
use<00:02:46.900> either<00:02:47.170> snow<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:49.030> white<00:02:49.330> wool

use either snow or or white wool
truthfully<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.340> think<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.970> snow

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
truthfully I think I like the snow

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.650 
truthfully I think I like the snow
better<00:02:53.050> because<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.710> more<00:02:53.890> white<00:02:54.250> than<00:02:54.660> that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
better because it's more white than that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
better because it's more white than that
that's<00:02:55.990> more<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.500> very<00:02:57.250> light<00:02:57.670> grey<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.680> would

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.210 
that's more of a very light grey I would
say<00:03:00.840> that's<00:03:01.840> more<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.440> over<00:03:02.740> all<00:03:02.770> white

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
