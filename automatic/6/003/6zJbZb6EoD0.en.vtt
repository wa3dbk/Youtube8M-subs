back<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> 80s<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:31.580> we<00:02:31.880> figured<00:02:32.030> they

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
back in the 80s because we figured they

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.510 
back in the 80s because we figured they
could<00:02:32.540> beat<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.990> Soviets<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:33.890> enough<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
could beat the Soviets just enough and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.850 
could beat the Soviets just enough and
that<00:02:34.910> turned<00:02:35.180> out<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.450> turn<00:02:36.080> around<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.530> bite

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that turned out to turn around and bite

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.950 
that turned out to turn around and bite
us<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.280> behinds<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:38.150> win<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.600> went<00:02:38.840> into

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
us on the behinds we win it we went into

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.590 
us on the behinds we win it we went into
we<00:02:39.560> invaded<00:02:39.920> Iraq<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:40.940> figured<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.270> Iraqi

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
we invaded Iraq and we figured the Iraqi

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.170 
we invaded Iraq and we figured the Iraqi
army<00:02:42.080> wouldn't<00:02:43.010> dissolve<00:02:43.460> that<00:02:43.790> they<00:02:43.970> would

army wouldn't dissolve that they would

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.120 
army wouldn't dissolve that they would

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
help us run the country and so we went

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.380 
help us run the country and so we went
in<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.550> light<00:02:46.730> footprint<00:02:47.210> no

that that worked and the only the only

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
real solution to Syria would be to go in

along with it so all that's left is to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
tons of chemical weapons can we justify

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.560 
tons of chemical weapons can we justify
getting<00:03:54.980> involved<00:03:55.459> here<00:03:55.760> without<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:56.030> plan<00:03:56.330> to

control<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.989> outcome<00:04:00.040> no<00:04:01.040> no<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.850> I<00:04:01.910> think

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
control the outcome no no and I think

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.460 
control the outcome no no and I think
you<00:04:02.180> can't<00:04:02.360> control<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.690> outcome<00:04:02.840> unless<00:04:03.320> you

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
you can't control the outcome unless you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.949 
you can't control the outcome unless you
do<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:03.650> Steve<00:04:03.920> suggests<00:04:04.459> which<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.730> play<00:04:05.690> war

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
do what Steve suggests which is play war

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.870 
do what Steve suggests which is play war
the<00:04:06.170> way<00:04:06.290> war<00:04:06.739> was<00:04:06.920> meant<00:04:07.100> to<00:04:07.190> be<00:04:07.220> played<00:04:07.610> all

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
the way war was meant to be played all

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.300 
the way war was meant to be played all
in<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.810> mean<00:04:09.050> you<00:04:09.200> know<00:04:09.320> it's<00:04:09.470> not<00:04:09.620> love<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.100> war

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
in I mean you know it's not love and war

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.190 
in I mean you know it's not love and war
are<00:04:10.550> very<00:04:10.730> similar<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.420> you're<00:04:11.570> not<00:04:11.750> fully

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
are very similar if you're not fully

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.420 
are very similar if you're not fully
committed<00:04:12.680> if<00:04:12.769> you're<00:04:12.890> not<00:04:13.010> willing<00:04:13.250> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
committed if you're not willing to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.040 
committed if you're not willing to
sacrifice<00:04:13.670> whatever<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.570> takes<00:04:14.780> if<00:04:14.930> you're

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
sacrifice whatever it takes if you're

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.300 
sacrifice whatever it takes if you're
not<00:04:15.170> willing<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.590> leave<00:04:15.739> all<00:04:15.920> other<00:04:15.950> options

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
not willing to leave all other options

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.310 
not willing to leave all other options
behind<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:17.180> don't<00:04:17.419> diddle<00:04:17.900> with<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.140> and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
behind then don't diddle with it and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.900 
behind then don't diddle with it and
that's<00:04:18.739> what<00:04:18.890> I'm<00:04:18.980> afraid<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.459> going<00:04:19.640> on<00:04:19.850> here

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
that's what I'm afraid is going on here

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.630 
that's what I'm afraid is going on here
and<00:04:20.510> we<00:04:21.080> run<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.320> huge<00:04:21.709> risk<00:04:21.859> here<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.400> don't

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
and we run a huge risk here I don't

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.730 
and we run a huge risk here I don't
think<00:04:22.820> most<00:04:23.000> American<00:04:23.540> people<00:04:23.990> are<00:04:24.230> saying

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
think most American people are saying

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.220 
think most American people are saying
that<00:04:25.100> we<00:04:25.280> should<00:04:25.490> do<00:04:25.850> nothing<00:04:26.419> when<00:04:26.840> we<00:04:26.990> see

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
that we should do nothing when we see

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.260 
that we should do nothing when we see
people<00:04:27.440> foaming<00:04:28.160> at<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.280> mouth<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.820> sweating

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
people foaming at the mouth and sweating

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.779 
people foaming at the mouth and sweating
and dying<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.289> seizures<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.190> streets<00:04:31.580> I

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
and dying of seizures in the streets I

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.310 
and dying of seizures in the streets I
think<00:04:32.300> they're<00:04:32.479> saying<00:04:32.720> we<00:04:32.930> need<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.200> be

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
think they're saying we need to be

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.140 
think they're saying we need to be
pretty<00:04:33.680> darn<00:04:34.010> sure<00:04:34.130> absolute

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
pretty darn sure absolute

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.930 
pretty darn sure absolute
be<00:04:35.240> sure<00:04:35.480> if<00:04:35.660> possible<00:04:35.870> as<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:37.160> who<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.700> who

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
be sure if possible as to who it is who

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.730 
be sure if possible as to who it is who
deployed<00:04:38.330> those<00:04:38.540> chemical<00:04:38.990> weapons<00:04:39.320> tell<00:04:39.590> us

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
deployed those chemical weapons tell us

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.040 
deployed those chemical weapons tell us
who<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:39.890> is<00:04:40.250> show<00:04:40.580> us<00:04:40.760> prove<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.420> and<00:04:41.600> then

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
who that is show us prove it and then

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.330 
who that is show us prove it and then
you<00:04:42.170> can<00:04:42.320> talk<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.620> us<00:04:42.680> about<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.920> response

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
you can talk to us about a response

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.430 
you can talk to us about a response
we're<00:04:43.760> bypassing<00:04:44.060> that<00:04:44.600> whole<00:04:44.780> process<00:04:45.020> we're

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
we're bypassing that whole process we're

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.860 
we're bypassing that whole process we're
leapfrogging<00:04:46.010> over<00:04:46.520> who<00:04:46.970> actually<00:04:47.300> did<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.690> in

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
leapfrogging over who actually did it in

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.510 
leapfrogging over who actually did it in
establishing<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.500> we're<00:04:48.890> just<00:04:49.010> going<00:04:49.220> right

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
establishing that we're just going right

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.760 
establishing that we're just going right
to<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:49.700> solution<00:04:50.290> yeah<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.350> know<00:04:51.530> guys<00:04:51.710> I

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
to the solution yeah you know guys I

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.320 
to the solution yeah you know guys I
think<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.130> guys<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.700> American<00:04:53.030> people

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
think you guys and the American people

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.180 
think you guys and the American people
are<00:04:53.390> right<00:04:53.540> on<00:04:53.720> this<00:04:53.900> thanks<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.350> lot<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:55.100> know

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
are right on this thanks a lot you know

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.070 
are right on this thanks a lot you know
I<00:04:55.220> think<00:04:55.340> it's<00:04:55.640> safe<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.910> argue<00:04:56.450> that<00:04:56.810> we're<00:04:56.990> in

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
I think it's safe to argue that we're in

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.450 
I think it's safe to argue that we're in
this<00:04:57.200> position<00:04:57.380> today<00:04:57.770> because<00:04:58.190> we<00:04:58.340> have<00:04:58.370> a

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
this position today because we have a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.550 
this position today because we have a
president<00:04:58.760> who<00:04:59.150> believed<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.960> United<00:05:00.350> States

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
president who believed the United States

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.440 
president who believed the United States
was<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.950> source<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.490> all<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.940> trouble<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
was the source of all the trouble in the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.150 
was the source of all the trouble in the
world<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.930> certainly<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.740> Middle<00:05:03.950> East

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
world and certainly in the Middle East

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.610 
world and certainly in the Middle East
if<00:05:04.430> America<00:05:05.180> lived<00:05:05.390> on<00:05:05.540> her<00:05:05.750> knees<00:05:05.960> peace

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
if America lived on her knees peace

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.810 
if America lived on her knees peace
would<00:05:06.830> break<00:05:07.070> out<00:05:07.220> all<00:05:07.400> over<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.700> globe

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
would break out all over the globe

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.700 
would break out all over the globe
unicorns<00:05:08.600> would<00:05:08.750> fly<00:05:08.990> again<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.470> there<00:05:09.590> would

unicorns would fly again and there would

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.340
