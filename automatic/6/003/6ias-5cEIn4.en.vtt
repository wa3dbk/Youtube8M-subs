00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 this I want to tell you today about 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.220
 such a feeder that every year 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.690
 gaining popularity with anglers like 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.119
 feeding trough with mold 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:23.369
 porridge stuffed and how it works I 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:31.430
 so today i will show such a feeding trough 60 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:37.110
 gram of company preston and you buy it 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:42.950
 buy the angler that the mold so it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:49.890
 looks in this mold it fills 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:56.300
 can porridge trough can in this way 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:03.359
 and porridge is very tightly rammed also may 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:09.150
 porridge is rammed and keeps well on 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:14.330
 this trough is very tight 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.330
 hook leash 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 I tied him 5 centimeters long from 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:31.330
 this point should be short to 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 fish is well lost use on 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.740
 hook any bait and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:44.049
 we only use porridge which 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:49.830
 It has small ingredients and now I 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:51.780
 I will show how porridge is stuffed into it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:02.580
 wheat 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 we can subtly have her porridge in this feeder 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 So 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.400
 and from above we set up the feeder and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.099
 we press hard we press 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:37.520
 messy and pressing and gat 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:40.350
 look at the other side as well 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.140
 and neat correspondent 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.140
 Dasha lies in this trough 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.820
 when casting on it is not so 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.740
 because it is loaded here 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:07.540
 sensor to this edge we tie a fishing line 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:12.100
 and throws you can make put 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.920
 hook into this mess inside and squeeze such 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.410
 so it turns you leash with 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.970
 the crochet will be inside the porridge when the fish 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:27.370
 will approach will begin to suck this mess out 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.780
 feeders it is likely random 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.120
 suck your hook 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.280
 can be used like this 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.230
 near the feeding trough hook bait as 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.290
 empty hook inside the cereal inside this 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.220
 the feeder seems to me like this 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.230
 how do you currently like now looks like 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.690
 to us more promising for fishing 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.760
 Thanks for watching, I think it is 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.250
 feeder deserves attention 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.980
 use it and you can catch it 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.940
 good fish do not tail you no scales 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.940
 good luck
