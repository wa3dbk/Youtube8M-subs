00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:24.380
 potato gun so cannon work like 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:32.750
 it works 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.750
 first rabbits lay a shell of horror 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.390
 then we have gas from the cylinder goes through 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.309
 solenoid valve in the chamber 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 combustion 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.170
 there it is mixed with a cooler and after 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.329
 the expiration of the cooler 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 valve controller we have reported that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 ready to shoot this button here 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 responsible for the shot now controller 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.629
 works with a timer that is after 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 pressing the button, we will start time 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.739
 then 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.470
 after the expiration time controller in 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.360
 automatic mode will give a spark 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.360
 look here went timer 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.210
 here's a click occurred means spark camera 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 combustion dome 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.750
 the shot was not because gazku started 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.049
 in fact that's why I'm in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.470
 In the room, so here it is written that with 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:40.500
 we do the work manually by timer 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.929
 means immediately after clicking this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 buttons we have a shot 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:54.240
 i.e. speed control 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:59.179
 engine from this but then all that is 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.179
 here was a shot further we 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.320
 open the bolt and going on 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.210
 ventilation 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.530
 combustion products as it happens then 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.800
 there are two like a bolt touches this 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.030
 switch 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.050
 the switch sends a signal to the controller 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.440
 and control includes 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 that engine to blow the mixture 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.370
 also at the same time go under the crane 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.900
 opens that is lifting lever with 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 this uranchiku crane and we commerce 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.050
 faces connected by external environment 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.750
 by this engine here 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.260
 so here's the product cycle occurred can 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.510
 to repeat 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:53.270
 bolt-projectile valve occurs 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.750
 triggered gas goes to non cow 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.690
 shot 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.080
 now i press the button and quickly 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.750
 happens immediately here quickly occurred 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.580
 but the cycle can be repeated 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.970
 Now what about the settings here 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.490
 manual mode i mean i can manually 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:19.370
 turn on and off all devices then 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:23.989
 there is an injection valve we work here 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.720
 the cooler is not audible to him inside silent 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:32.200
 brushless computer cooler 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.200
 honestly to be sincere but 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.280
 engine blowing combustion products can 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.280
 be powerful here it is 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:53.110
 its speed can be adjusted here 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:55.470
 set the speed for example 70 years conditional 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.470
 units 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.090
 we have Medynsky work but that's all 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.800
 pampering 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:13.970
 the most important thing is the time settings 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.269
 all devices work exactly 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.070
 the main thing to create in the combustion chamber 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.470
 suitable 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.920
 oxygen gas mixture to occur 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.980
 arson 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.660
 and the shot otherwise will not light anything 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.860
 explode shorter gun is not built 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.860
 the amount of gas that we regulate 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.430
 regulated by this valve 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.230
 that is, how many fall in how much we serve 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.140
 voltage over time this valve 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:47.270
 so much gas now comes now and 2 and 3 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:52.940
 seconds two three seconds 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:56.919
 There is a cooler inside the method 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:00.140
 mix gas and oxygen 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:04.700
 time blowing a mixture of that engine powerful 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.530
 and time which is responsible for how much we 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.880
 Spark submit that is enough of all 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.150
 one spark therefore costs a little 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.050
 time 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.050
 0 for a second so 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.999
 actually it is a gas cylinder 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:24.669
 solenoid valve battery 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:27.959
 the controller is always worth the blocking generator 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:31.509
 that is, there is no power plug 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:36.419
 blocking generator creates voltage 12 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:46.839
 volt voltage is several kilovolts 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:48.759
 now I will show what's inside so here it is 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.659
 step-up transformer 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.519
 TV lineman so-called 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.269
 simple blocking generator circuit 

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.429
 powerful transistor 

00:05:55.269 --> 00:06:00.819
 see voltage back connection on 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:03.879
 inductance here is here 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.529
 voltage multiplier powered by 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.809
 this transformer and issuing output 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:14.319
 already at constant voltage which 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:16.179
 served on these two screws here 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.879
 in this way inside the combustion chamber 

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:27.539
 there is a spark between them that ignites 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:38.009
 gas so we'll see here 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:42.700
 controller stockings so here we have 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:47.920
 dashboard that is 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:51.630
 buttons among here and the power bus screen 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:56.110
 information here we have the controller itself 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:07:00.100
 the main controller board is power 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.290
 transistors up to rely 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.240
 voltage crystal resonator 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:08.080
 filter capacitor and this one 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:13.600
 thing is for galvanic isolation then 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:15.700
 there is land they do not generally have earth 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.250
 power which goes to all appliances and 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.030
 digital land they have different also for 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.080
 this used axes 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.860
 the microcontroller is not visible it is different 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.900
 side vs andy package so board 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:34.030
 all were poisoned by hand too 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:40.170
 printed on a computer by 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:40.170
 better technology so actually everything
