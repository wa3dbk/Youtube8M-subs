00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
map right here we can see the in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
map right here we can see the in
contention<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.620> CDE<00:00:47.010> there's<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:47.879> strong

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
contention as CDE there's a very strong

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
contention as CDE there's a very strong
life<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.450> they're<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.960> sea<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
life here they're going to be at sea so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.619 
life here they're going to be at sea so
I<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.829> sent<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.190> fridge<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.579> push<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.300> get

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I was sent a fridge here push on get

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
I was sent a fridge here push on get
down<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.809> e<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.320> welcome<00:00:52.800> Andy<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.610> reason

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
down on e and welcome Andy the reason

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
down on e and welcome Andy the reason
being<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> likelihood<00:00:55.230> there's<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.559> be

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
being is a likelihood there's gonna be

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.990 
being is a likelihood there's gonna be
enemy<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.430> quite<00:00:56.610> close<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
enemy here because it's quite close to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
enemy here because it's quite close to
see<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> also<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.070> wiped<00:00:59.309> out

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
see and also as you see we get wiped out

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.660 
see and also as you see we get wiped out
but<00:00:59.969> also<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.739> idea<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.489> if

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
but also not just that the idea is is if

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
but also not just that the idea is is if
you're<00:01:02.940> putting<00:01:03.120> pressure<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.840> 2d<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.769> here

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you're putting pressure on 2d right here

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
you're putting pressure on 2d right here
then<00:01:05.549> there's<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> likelihood<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.420> some

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
then there's a likelihood that some

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
then there's a likelihood that some
enemy<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.380> sea<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.310> okay<00:01:08.729> we've

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
enemy at sea are going to go okay we've

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
enemy at sea are going to go okay we've
got<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.390> issue<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.750> d<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.049> need<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.500> back

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
got an issue at d we need to come back

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.520 
got an issue at d we need to come back
to<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.070> point<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:12.030> right<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.170> send

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
to that point all right now if we send

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
to that point all right now if we send
somebody<00:01:13.770> else<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> other<00:01:14.880> point<00:01:15.570> as

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
somebody else on to the other point as

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
somebody else on to the other point as
well<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.650> means<00:01:16.860> there's<00:01:17.070> suddenly<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.520> an

not<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.240> mention<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> fact<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.170> despite<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
not to mention the fact that despite the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
not to mention the fact that despite the
fact<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.430> got<00:01:29.460> wiped<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.000> by<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.329> guy

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
fact that we got wiped out by that guy

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
fact that we got wiped out by that guy
right<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.470> spawn<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
right there we can now spawn in here and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
right there we can now spawn in here and
hey<00:01:32.970> look<00:01:33.119> we're<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.570> we're<00:01:33.840> still

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
hey look we're good to go we're still

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.510 
hey look we're good to go we're still
behind<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.530> lines<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.979> still<00:01:35.159> causing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
behind the lines with still causing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
behind the lines with still causing
problem<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:36.090> still<00:01:36.270> capping<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.840> then

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
problem we're still capping and then

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.039 
problem we're still capping and then
maybe<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.070> come<00:01:38.430> back<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:39.000> 2d<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> cause<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
maybe we can come back on 2d and cause a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.359 
maybe we can come back on 2d and cause a
little<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.439> back<00:01:40.680> rage<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.250> right

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
little bit of back rage on them right

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
little bit of back rage on them right
there<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> goes<00:01:42.630> down

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
there so this is how it goes down

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.410 
there so this is how it goes down
annoyingly<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.740> very<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.820> stupidly<00:01:45.270> got

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
annoyingly I'm very very stupidly got

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
annoyingly I'm very very stupidly got
caught<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.720> yet<00:01:45.930> again<00:01:46.049> also<00:01:46.649> even<00:01:46.710> looking

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
caught out yet again also even looking

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.830 
caught out yet again also even looking
out<00:01:47.189> there<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.090> look<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.299> those<00:01:48.420> backups

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
out there and I look at those backups

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.300 
out there and I look at those backups
just<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.320> am<00:01:49.500> i<00:01:49.619> doing<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.040> like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just like what am i doing I'm just like

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
just like what am i doing I'm just like
staring<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> walls<00:01:51.240> idiot<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.470> anyway

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
staring at the walls idiot but anyway

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.310 
staring at the walls idiot but anyway
it's<00:01:53.189> beside<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> point<00:01:53.909> yet<00:01:54.600> again<00:01:54.960> shows

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it's beside the point yet again shows

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.440 
it's beside the point yet again shows
how<00:01:55.500> tactics<00:01:56.009> wins<00:01:56.340> over<00:01:56.729> complete<00:01:57.240> stupidity

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
how tactics wins over complete stupidity

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.569 
how tactics wins over complete stupidity
now<00:01:58.290> okay<00:01:58.829> we've<00:01:58.979> coming<00:01:59.219> around<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> back

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
now okay we've coming around the back

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.969 
now okay we've coming around the back
here<00:01:59.790> managed<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> secure<00:02:00.750> E<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.320> they

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
here managed to secure E and they

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.200 
here managed to secure E and they
haven't<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.399> sent<00:02:02.579> enough<00:02:02.759> people<00:02:03.030> back

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
haven't really sent enough people back

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030 
haven't really sent enough people back
here<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> probably<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.890> they've

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
here to get it probably because they've

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.440 
here to get it probably because they've
got<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.280> many<00:02:05.369> people<00:02:05.670> forward<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> sea

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
got so many people forward at the sea

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
got so many people forward at the sea
point<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.500> kind<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.069> was<00:02:08.190> too

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
point it they kind of think I was too

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.559 
point it they kind of think I was too
far<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> come<00:02:08.940> back<00:02:09.090> we're<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
far to come back we're just going to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
far to come back we're just going to
keep<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.840> pushing<00:02:10.229> pushing<00:02:10.440> forward<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
keep on pushing pushing forward and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.320 
keep on pushing pushing forward and
that's<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> how<00:02:11.730> these<00:02:11.879> guys<00:02:12.060> played

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
that's kind of how these guys played

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.410 
that's kind of how these guys played
through<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.599> round<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.930> remember

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
through this round we remember

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.000 
through this round we remember
it's<00:02:13.540> very<00:02:13.660> aggressive<00:02:14.349> all<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> way<00:02:14.740> through

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
it's very aggressive all the way through

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's very aggressive all the way through
but<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.640> we're<00:02:15.940> moving<00:02:16.030> back<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.540> coming

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
but now we're moving back in coming

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.540 
but now we're moving back in coming
through<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> med<00:02:17.739> bay<00:02:17.770> I'm<00:02:18.280> going<00:02:18.489> to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
through here the med bay I'm going to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.640 
through here the med bay I'm going to
get<00:02:18.640> back<00:02:18.790> down<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.270> 2d<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.319> just<00:02:20.440> really

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
get back down on 2d but this just really

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.260 
get back down on 2d but this just really
illustrates<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> idea<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.610> split<00:02:21.940> flank

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
illustrates the idea of a split flank

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.400 
illustrates the idea of a split flank
and<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.930> into<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> couple<00:02:23.319> of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and you can do that into a couple of

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.199 
and you can do that into a couple of
different<00:02:23.620> ways<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:24.069> can<00:02:24.430> put<00:02:24.640> three<00:02:24.940> guys<00:02:25.180> on

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
different ways you can put three guys on

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.729 
different ways you can put three guys on
the<00:02:25.450> nearest<00:02:25.750> most<00:02:25.900> dangerous<00:02:26.290> point<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
the nearest most dangerous point or you

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.260 
the nearest most dangerous point or you
can<00:02:26.890> split<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.430> like<00:02:27.610> one<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:27.880> four

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
can split it with like one of four

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.970 
can split it with like one of four
however<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.959> want<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.140> do<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.800> key

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
however you want to do it but the key

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.620 
however you want to do it but the key
issue<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.459> obviously<00:02:30.580> send<00:02:31.030> people<00:02:31.209> into<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
issue is to obviously send people into a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.690 
issue is to obviously send people into a
couple<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:31.959> different<00:02:32.200> directions<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.739> split

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
couple of different directions to split

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370 
couple of different directions to split
that<00:02:33.819> pressure<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.420> enemy<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.810> create<00:02:35.350> a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that pressure on the enemy and create a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.900 
that pressure on the enemy and create a
kind<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.770> confusion<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.400> them<00:02:36.550> where<00:02:36.790> they're

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
kind of confusion for them where they're

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.190 
kind of confusion for them where they're
going<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> go<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.270> maybe<00:02:37.780> they<00:02:37.900> weren't<00:02:37.989> bother

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
going to go to maybe they weren't bother

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.449 
going to go to maybe they weren't bother
to<00:02:38.319> come<00:02:38.440> back<00:02:38.620> at<00:02:38.739> all<00:02:38.890> doesn't<00:02:39.400> really

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
to come back at all doesn't really

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.009 
to come back at all doesn't really
matter<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.910> if<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.120> go<00:02:40.269> down<00:02:40.510> then<00:02:40.900> you're

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
matter and if you go down then you're

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.300 
matter and if you go down then you're
still<00:02:41.260> behind<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> lines<00:02:41.860> you're<00:02:42.190> not

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
still behind the lines you're not

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.040 
still behind the lines you're not
putting<00:02:42.550> all<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.880> your<00:02:43.180> eggs<00:02:43.360> into<00:02:43.720> one<00:02:43.900> basket

riot<00:03:34.959> shields<00:03:35.410> but<00:03:36.100> then<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.280> thought<00:03:36.370> about<00:03:36.549> it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
riot shields but then I thought about it

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.490 
riot shields but then I thought about it
a<00:03:36.820> bit<00:03:36.850> more<00:03:36.970> Anna<00:03:37.359> I'm<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:38.140> massively

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
a bit more Anna I'm not massively

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.780 
a bit more Anna I'm not massively
concerned<00:03:38.980> if<00:03:39.100> anything<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.459> actually<00:03:39.579> think

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
concerned if anything I actually think

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.190 
concerned if anything I actually think
this<00:03:39.940> could<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.420> good<00:03:40.690> thing<00:03:40.750> in<00:03:40.989> some

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
this could be a good thing in some

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.630 
this could be a good thing in some
situations<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.890> could<00:03:42.100> be<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> good<00:03:42.370> thing<00:03:42.430> in

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
situations it could be a good thing in

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.550 
situations it could be a good thing in
some<00:03:42.880> locker<00:03:43.150> situations<00:03:43.870> could<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.410> getting

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
some locker situations could be getting

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.890 
some locker situations could be getting
some<00:03:44.890> Metro<00:03:45.280> situations<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.299> could<00:03:46.600> be<00:03:46.720> good

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
some Metro situations it could be good

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.930 
some Metro situations it could be good
thing<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.170> some<00:03:47.470> Shanghai<00:03:48.070> situations<00:03:48.730> all

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940

thing in some Shanghai situations all
these<00:03:49.120> kind<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.329> things<00:03:49.420> anything<00:03:50.260> we<00:03:50.410> have

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
these kind of things anything we have

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.830 
these kind of things anything we have
very<00:03:51.489> locked<00:03:51.910> down<00:03:52.239> close<00:03:52.570> called

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
very locked down close called

itself<00:03:55.359> could<00:03:55.750> actually<00:03:55.930> be<00:03:56.440> quite<00:03:56.680> an

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
itself could actually be quite an

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.740 
itself could actually be quite an
interesting<00:03:57.340> benefit<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.180> mean<00:03:58.480> think<00:03:58.600> how

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
interesting benefit I mean think how

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.849 
interesting benefit I mean think how
many<00:03:58.900> times<00:03:59.140> you're<00:03:59.319> trying<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.530> push<00:03:59.709> into

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
many times you're trying to push into

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.979 
many times you're trying to push into
that<00:04:00.040> second<00:04:00.459> base<00:04:00.579> on<00:04:00.760> metro<00:04:01.120> rush<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.600> he's

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
that second base on metro rush and he's

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.660 
that second base on metro rush and he's
just<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.380> nightmare<00:04:02.650> think<00:04:03.190> about<00:04:03.370> how<00:04:03.519> many

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
just a nightmare think about how many

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.740 
just a nightmare think about how many
times<00:04:03.880> you're<00:04:04.030> trying<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.269> push<00:04:04.450> up<00:04:04.600> those

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
times you're trying to push up those

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.229 
times you're trying to push up those
stairwells<00:04:05.290> on<00:04:05.470> conquest<00:04:06.130> Metro<00:04:06.640> think<00:04:07.030> about

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
stairwells on conquest Metro think about

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.340 
stairwells on conquest Metro think about
Locker<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.720> same<00:04:07.930> when<00:04:08.049> you're<00:04:08.140> trying<00:04:08.230> to

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
Locker the same when you're trying to

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.840 
Locker the same when you're trying to
get<00:04:08.410> into<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.799> panopticon<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.370> kind<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:09.579> push

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
get into the panopticon you kind of push

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.129 
get into the panopticon you kind of push
through<00:04:10.060> those<00:04:10.209> sore<00:04:10.480> bottleneck<00:04:10.900> choke

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
through those sore bottleneck choke

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.129 
through those sore bottleneck choke
points<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.250> could<00:04:12.850> provide<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.630> really

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
points so it could provide a really

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.050 
points so it could provide a really
interesting<00:04:14.590> mechanic<00:04:15.220> for<00:04:15.400> those<00:04:15.609> kind<00:04:16.000> of

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
interesting mechanic for those kind of

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.599 
interesting mechanic for those kind of
horrible<00:04:16.530> situations<00:04:17.530> now<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.400> other<00:04:18.459> thing

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
horrible situations now the other thing

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.430 
horrible situations now the other thing
is<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:19.000> don't<00:04:19.209> think<00:04:19.539> that<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.870> shield's

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
is I don't think that the shield's

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.599 
is I don't think that the shield's
themselves<00:04:20.859> are<00:04:20.919> going<00:04:21.039> to<00:04:21.100> be<00:04:21.190> completely

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
themselves are going to be completely

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.700 
themselves are going to be completely
indestructible<00:04:22.150> okay<00:04:22.840> let's<00:04:23.200> not<00:04:23.320> forget<00:04:23.560> we

wipe out anybody with riot shield so

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.670 
wipe out anybody with riot shield so
it's<00:04:40.780> not<00:04:40.870> going<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.199> make<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.380> like

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
it's not going to make you like

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.140 
it's not going to make you like
invincible<00:04:42.400> it's<00:04:42.639> just<00:04:42.820> going<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:43.000> like

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
to kind of push forward and get through

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.000 
to kind of push forward and get through
certain<00:04:46.840> things<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.290> let's<00:04:47.530> not<00:04:47.590> forget<00:04:47.680> as

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
certain things and let's not forget as

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.439 
certain things and let's not forget as
well<00:04:48.160> carrying<00:04:48.490> around<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.760> shield<00:04:49.060> it's

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
well carrying around a shield it's

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.150 
well carrying around a shield it's
probably<00:04:49.690> gonna<00:04:49.810> be<00:04:49.870> quite<00:04:50.169> cumbersome<00:04:50.800> it's

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
probably gonna be quite cumbersome it's

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.040 
probably gonna be quite cumbersome it's
probably<00:04:51.430> not<00:04:51.610> going<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.820> be<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.389> know<00:04:52.540> that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
probably not going to be you know that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.689 
probably not going to be you know that
easy<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.470> move<00:04:53.680> around<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:54.370> probably<00:04:54.580> gonna

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
easy to move around it's probably gonna

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.820 
easy to move around it's probably gonna
be<00:04:54.760> quite<00:04:55.090> clunky<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.350> probably<00:04:56.560> put

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
be quite clunky and it's probably put

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.170 
be quite clunky and it's probably put
you<00:04:56.889> a<00:04:56.919> disadvantage<00:04:57.520> as<00:04:57.699> well<00:04:57.940> as<00:04:58.060> the

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
you a disadvantage as well as the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.270 
you a disadvantage as well as the
benefit<00:04:58.540> that<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:58.780> provides<00:04:59.110> so<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.710> wouldn't

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
benefit that it provides so I wouldn't

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.680 
benefit that it provides so I wouldn't
be<00:05:00.460> too<00:05:00.639> panicked<00:05:00.970> about<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.449> right<00:05:01.630> now

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
be too panicked about this right now

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.480 
be too panicked about this right now
having<00:05:02.289> said<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.590> in<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:02.979> past<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.460> know

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
having said that in the past you know

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.189 
having said that in the past you know
you<00:05:03.639> sort<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.330> think<00:05:04.389> about<00:05:04.690> these<00:05:04.780> things<00:05:04.990> and

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
you sort of think about these things and

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.439 
you sort of think about these things and
then<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.410> ends<00:05:05.590> up<00:05:05.650> being<00:05:05.830> totally<00:05:06.220> Opie<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:07.360> we

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
then it ends up being totally Opie so we

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.700 
then it ends up being totally Opie so we
just<00:05:07.570> have<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.810> see<00:05:07.930> how<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.110> rolls<00:05:08.320> out<00:05:08.500> but<00:05:08.680> I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
just have to see how it rolls out but I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.960 
just have to see how it rolls out but I
wouldn't<00:05:09.010> freak<00:05:09.280> out<00:05:09.430> about<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.699> right<00:05:09.910> now

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
wouldn't freak out about this right now

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.029 
wouldn't freak out about this right now
I<00:05:10.449> wouldn't<00:05:10.960> freak<00:05:11.260> out<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.560> battlefield

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
I wouldn't freak out the battlefield

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.409 
I wouldn't freak out the battlefield
it's<00:05:12.280> becoming<00:05:12.550> colored<00:05:12.910> because<00:05:13.180> let's<00:05:13.360> face

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
it's becoming colored because let's face

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.960 
it's becoming colored because let's face
it<00:05:13.720> it's<00:05:13.840> not<00:05:14.139> as<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.280> say<00:05:15.490> there's<00:05:15.699> so<00:05:15.880> many

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
it it's not as I say there's so many

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.550 
it it's not as I say there's so many
different<00:05:16.240> other<00:05:16.510> mechanical<00:05:16.990> aspects<00:05:17.410> which

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
different other mechanical aspects which

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.439 
different other mechanical aspects which
will<00:05:17.740> counter<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.190> riot<00:05:18.460> shield<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:19.150> really

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
will counter the riot shield it really

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.180 
will counter the riot shield it really
doesn't<00:05:19.750> concern<00:05:19.840> me<00:05:20.110> at<00:05:20.350> this<00:05:20.530> point<00:05:20.770> in<00:05:20.949> time

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
doesn't concern me at this point in time

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.650 
doesn't concern me at this point in time
but<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.699> do<00:05:21.789> think<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.180> could<00:05:22.360> provide<00:05:22.600> some

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
but I do think it could provide some

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.140 
but I do think it could provide some
interesting<00:05:23.380> mechanical<00:05:23.919> gameplay<00:05:24.910> there

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
interesting mechanical gameplay there

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.540 
interesting mechanical gameplay there
and<00:05:25.360> it's<00:05:26.229> going<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.380> change<00:05:26.440> things<00:05:26.949> up<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.520> a

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
and it's going to change things up to a

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.219 
and it's going to change things up to a
certain<00:05:27.910> degree<00:05:27.940> so<00:05:28.449> we'll<00:05:28.870> just<00:05:28.900> have<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.199> see

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
certain degree so we'll just have to see

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.230 
certain degree so we'll just have to see
how<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.560> plays<00:05:29.680> out<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.250> naval<00:05:30.820> strike<00:05:31.000> people

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
how that plays out I naval strike people

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.520 
how that plays out I naval strike people
keep<00:05:31.360> asking<00:05:31.570> about<00:05:31.810> this<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.200> think<00:05:32.260> it's

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
keep asking about this I think it's

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.170 
keep asking about this I think it's
probably<00:05:32.620> me<00:05:32.889> come<00:05:33.039> around<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.340> 25th<00:05:33.880> I<00:05:34.000> think

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
probably me come around the 25th I think

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.820 
probably me come around the 25th I think
people<00:05:34.300> keep<00:05:34.510> talking<00:05:34.660> about<00:05:34.930> that<00:05:35.080> so<00:05:35.320> that's

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
people keep talking about that so that's

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.860 
people keep talking about that so that's
