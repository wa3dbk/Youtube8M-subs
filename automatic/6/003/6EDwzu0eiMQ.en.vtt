machine tutorial series today we're
going<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.440> taking<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.800> look<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> diesel

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
going to be taking a look at the diesel

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.549 
going to be taking a look at the diesel
generator<00:00:11.880> from<00:00:12.120> Greg<00:00:12.360> tech<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
generator from Greg tech now what the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.200 
generator from Greg tech now what the
diesel<00:00:13.830> generator<00:00:14.190> does<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.820> takes<00:00:14.969> some

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
diesel generator does is it takes some

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.140 
diesel generator does is it takes some
different<00:00:15.540> liquids<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.830> candor<00:00:17.670> bucket

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
different liquids and the candor bucket

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840 
different liquids and the candor bucket
version<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.279> turns<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.670> into

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
version of it and it turns it into

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.179 
version of it and it turns it into
energy<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.680> basic<00:00:23.010> user

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
energy for you so the basic user

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
energy for you so the basic user
interface<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.359> got<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.510> name<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> machine

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
interface is you got to name the machine

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.720 
interface is you got to name the machine
there<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:26.220> liquid<00:00:26.490> amount

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
there and you get your liquid amount

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029 
there and you get your liquid amount
right<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.359> now<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.230> goes<00:00:28.500> up<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> 10

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
right here now this goes up to 10

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
right here now this goes up to 10
buckets<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> 10,000<00:00:30.390> units<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.960> down

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
buckets which is 10,000 units and down

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.139 
buckets which is 10,000 units and down
here<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.189> corner<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.880> where<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
here in this corner this is where it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.299 
here in this corner this is where it
would<00:00:33.270> display<00:00:33.660> whatever<00:00:34.170> fuel<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> has

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
would display whatever fuel that it has

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520 
would display whatever fuel that it has
inside<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> moment<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:37.290> don't<00:00:37.350> have

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
inside of it at the moment we don't have

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
inside of it at the moment we don't have
any<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.489> blank<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.510> top

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
any in there so it's just blank the top

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
any in there so it's just blank the top
one<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.050> where<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.410> put<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:41.010> cells

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
one is where you would put in your cells

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.639 
one is where you would put in your cells
or<00:00:41.760> buckets<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.870> different<00:00:43.260> liquids<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
or buckets of the different liquids that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.319 
or buckets of the different liquids that
you<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:45.059> once<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you can put in here and then once you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.700 
you can put in here and then once you
put<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> there<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.140> empty<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.530> into

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
put it in there it will empty it into

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.090 
put it in there it will empty it into
the<00:00:46.980> machines<00:00:47.660> internal<00:00:48.660> storage<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> then

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the machines internal storage and then

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
the machines internal storage and then
it<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.309> spit<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> empty<00:00:50.940> bucket<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.390> empty

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it will spit the empty bucket or empty

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
it will spit the empty bucket or empty
cell<00:00:51.840> back<00:00:52.050> down<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.670> ahead<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
cell back down here if we go ahead and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.340 
cell back down here if we go ahead and
take<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> look<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> building<00:00:54.809> recipe<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
take a look at the building recipe for

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.760 
take a look at the building recipe for
this<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.430> five<00:00:56.699> refined<00:00:57.180> iron<00:00:57.770> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this it is five refined iron to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
this it is five refined iron to
electronic<00:00:59.640> circuits<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:01.320> generator<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
electronic circuits and a generator so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
electronic circuits and a generator so
kind<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> basic<00:01:03.210> powering<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.290> of

kind of the basic powering and kind of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.710 
kind of the basic powering and kind of
working<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> diesel<00:01:05.309> generator<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
working with the diesel generator is for

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.230 
working with the diesel generator is for
example<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> fuel<00:01:07.920> bucket<00:01:08.340> I'm

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
example here I have a fuel bucket I'm

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
example here I have a fuel bucket I'm
going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> insula<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.920> can

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
going to put it into the insula you can

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
going to put it into the insula you can
see<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:11.640> goes<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.390> internal

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
see that it then goes into the internal

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
see that it then goes into the internal
storage<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.040> starts<00:01:14.340> working<00:01:14.729> away<00:01:14.820> at

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
storage and then starts working away at

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
storage and then starts working away at
it<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> square<00:01:16.680> down

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it you can now see that the square down

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
it you can now see that the square down
here<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.250> filled<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.759> whatever<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.390> in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
here is filled up with whatever I put in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
here is filled up with whatever I put in
there<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.710> fuel<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
there like you can see fuel and that it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.740 
there like you can see fuel and that it
produces<00:01:21.680> 384,000<00:01:22.680> EU<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.340> 12<00:01:23.880> EU<00:01:24.210> per<00:01:24.420> tick

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
produces 384,000 EU at 12 EU per tick

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
produces 384,000 EU at 12 EU per tick
now<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.740> grab<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> empty<00:01:26.369> bucket

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
now we can just grab the empty bucket

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
now we can just grab the empty bucket
back<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.330> grab<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.259> whatever

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
back and go grab some more or whatever

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
back and go grab some more or whatever
you<00:01:28.740> wanted<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.509> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you wanted to do and you can see that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
you wanted to do and you can see that
its<00:01:30.780> power<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.320> MF<00:01:31.650> s<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.100> pretty

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
its power in this MF s you up pretty

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980 
its power in this MF s you up pretty
well<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.450> ahead<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.630> take<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> look

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
well so if we go ahead and take a look

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
well so if we go ahead and take a look
at<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.860> different<00:01:34.979> liquids<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> diesel

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
at all the different liquids the diesel

EU<00:02:10.510> so<00:02:11.510> if<00:02:11.629> we<00:02:11.720> go<00:02:11.840> ahead<00:02:12.049> and<00:02:12.170> take<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.319> look<00:02:12.500> at

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
EU so if we go ahead and take a look at

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.380 
EU so if we go ahead and take a look at
the<00:02:12.739> automation<00:02:13.310> now<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.239> for

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the automation now this is for

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.140 
the automation now this is for
automating<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.170> with<00:02:15.680> buckets<00:02:16.310> or<00:02:16.459> cells<00:02:16.700> so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
automating it with buckets or cells so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.690 
automating it with buckets or cells so
for<00:02:17.480> example<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:18.530> top<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.340> your

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
for example the top is going to be your

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.910 
for example the top is going to be your
input<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:20.900> I'm<00:02:20.989> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.200> throw<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.470> fuel

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
input so I'm going to throw this fuel

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.220 
input so I'm going to throw this fuel
bucket<00:02:22.310> up<00:02:22.430> there<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:24.019> see<00:02:24.200> that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
bucket up there you can now see that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.539 
bucket up there you can now see that
it's<00:02:24.440> going<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:24.709> ahead<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.099> suck<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.340> on

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
it's going to go ahead and suck it on

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.270 
it's going to go ahead and suck it on
down<00:02:25.790> into<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.269> diesel<00:02:26.599> generator<00:02:27.280> it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
down into the diesel generator it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.610 
down into the diesel generator it's
going<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.549> go<00:02:28.670> ahead<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.000> empty<00:02:29.209> out<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:30.200> fuel

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
going to go ahead and empty out the fuel

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.990 
going to go ahead and empty out the fuel
bucket<00:02:31.099> into<00:02:31.569> this<00:02:32.950> internal<00:02:33.950> storage<00:02:34.370> once

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
bucket into this internal storage once

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.539 
bucket into this internal storage once
it<00:02:35.239> has<00:02:35.390> enough<00:02:35.720> room<00:02:35.920> then<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.310> empty

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
it has enough room then the empty

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.309 
it has enough room then the empty
buckets<00:02:37.879> going<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.060> come<00:02:38.269> down<00:02:38.480> into<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.140> out

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
buckets going to come down into the out

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.500 
buckets going to come down into the out
and<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:40.069> would<00:02:40.190> get<00:02:40.340> sucked<00:02:40.610> out<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.790> side<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
and it would get sucked out the side the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.270 
and it would get sucked out the side the
automation<00:02:42.109> for<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.590> liquids<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.069> lot

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
automation for the liquids is a lot

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.670 
automation for the liquids is a lot
easier<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.629> example<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.200> have<00:02:45.230> liquid

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
easier just for example I have liquid

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.650 
easier just for example I have liquid
ucks<00:02:45.859> here<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.879> this<00:02:47.060> one<00:02:47.269> wrenched

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
ucks here and I have this one wrenched

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.420 
ucks here and I have this one wrenched
so<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.019> we<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.290> down<00:02:48.590> arrow<00:02:48.829> down<00:02:49.129> and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
so that we have the down arrow down and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.580 
so that we have the down arrow down and
we<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> redstone<00:02:50.269> signal<00:02:50.569> applied<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.440> it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
we have a redstone signal applied to it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.289 
we have a redstone signal applied to it
now<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.099> can<00:02:52.310> also<00:02:52.459> use<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.849> waterproof

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
now you can also use the waterproof

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.539 
now you can also use the waterproof
pipes<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:54.379> prefer<00:02:54.590> liquid<00:02:55.129> x<00:02:55.280> just

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
pipes I just prefer liquid x just

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.430 
pipes I just prefer liquid x just
because<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.819> how<00:02:55.909> easy<00:02:56.180> they<00:02:56.420> are<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.319> can

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
because I how easy they are and you can

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.899 
because I how easy they are and you can
see<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:57.829> one<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.040> fully<00:02:58.370> filled<00:02:58.700> up

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
see that this one is fully filled up

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.690 
see that this one is fully filled up
with<00:02:59.390> 10<00:02:59.959> buckets<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.950> we<00:03:01.010> got<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.250> fuel<00:03:01.430> down

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
with 10 buckets and we got the fuel down

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.160 
with 10 buckets and we got the fuel down
there<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:02.090> we<00:03:02.329> can<00:03:02.480> see<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:02.629> it's<00:03:02.870> powering

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
there and we can see that it's powering

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.110 
there and we can see that it's powering
