hummingbirds into your garden

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
hummingbirds into your garden
is<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.239> plant<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.660> variety<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.170> flowering

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is to plant a variety of flowering

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.290 
is to plant a variety of flowering
plants<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.280> come<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.789> bloom<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
plants that come into bloom in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.140 
plants that come into bloom in
succession<00:01:03.960> throughout<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> season

and<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> best<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.939> them<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> nest

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and so the best way to get them to nest

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
and so the best way to get them to nest
in<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:12.810> yard<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> nectar<00:01:14.430> source
