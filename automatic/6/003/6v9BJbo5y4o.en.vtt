indicates a 12 volt problem on the power
supply<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:19.830> let's<00:00:20.100> talk<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.340> how<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.609> down<00:00:20.939> I

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
supply so let's talk about how to down I

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
supply so let's talk about how to down I
had<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> diagnose<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.410> now<00:00:22.859> after

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
had to diagnose this from now after

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.660 
had to diagnose this from now after
about<00:00:23.250> 10<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.029> 20<00:00:24.269> minutes<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> TV

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
about 10 or 20 minutes of the TV

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.890 
about 10 or 20 minutes of the TV
flashing<00:00:26.670> away<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.029> turning<00:00:27.330> itself<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
flashing away or turning itself on and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
flashing away or turning itself on and
off<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.199> few<00:00:28.529> times<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.279> will<00:00:29.429> eventually<00:00:29.640> start

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
off a few times it will eventually start

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.479 
off a few times it will eventually start
up<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> rest<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.189> TV's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
up so we know the rest of the TV's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
up so we know the rest of the TV's
working<00:00:32.730> moving<00:00:33.660> intermittent<00:00:34.140> failure<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
working moving intermittent failure and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.729 
working moving intermittent failure and
support<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.160> temperature<00:00:35.489> sensitive

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
support with temperature sensitive

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.860 
support with temperature sensitive
okay<00:00:38.739> I'm<00:00:38.890> measuring<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.489> 1209<00:00:40.450> but<00:00:40.600> actually

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
okay I'm measuring the 1209 but actually

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.410 
okay I'm measuring the 1209 but actually
on<00:00:40.930> this<00:00:41.110> model<00:00:41.320> it's<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.680> 9-volt<00:00:42.280> line<00:00:42.520> but<00:00:42.879> it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
on this model it's a 9-volt line but it

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.410 
on this model it's a 9-volt line but it
works<00:00:43.629> either<00:00:43.870> way<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.230> as<00:00:44.290> we<00:00:44.410> can<00:00:44.530> see<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
works either way and as we can see it's

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.650 
works either way and as we can see it's
only<00:00:46.660> about<00:00:46.809> five<00:00:47.230> point<00:00:47.470> nine<00:00:47.530> volts<00:00:48.660> five

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
only about five point nine volts five

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.900 
only about five point nine volts five
point<00:00:49.930> eight<00:00:49.989> five<00:00:50.230> point<00:00:50.530> nine<00:00:50.590> volts<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.820> the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
point eight five point nine volts so the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:05.700 
point eight five point nine volts so the
heat<00:00:52.180> up

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.100 

the<00:01:06.710> voltage<00:01:07.070> Rises<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:07.880> when<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.869> reaches

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
the voltage Rises and when it reaches

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:31.110 
the voltage Rises and when it reaches
about<00:01:09.289> seven<00:01:09.710> volts<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.189> TV<00:01:10.520> starts<00:01:10.880> working

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.840 

you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.130 

and<00:01:36.140> now<00:01:37.140> we're<00:01:37.350> getting<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.799> 7.2<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and now we're getting about 7.2 on the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
and now we're getting about 7.2 on the
nine<00:01:40.380> volt<00:01:40.619> rail<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.100> still<00:01:41.430> low<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
nine volt rail which is still low but

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
nine volt rail which is still low but
probably<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.360> off<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> TV<00:01:43.259> we've<00:01:43.979> now

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
probably not off like the TV we've now

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.940 
probably not off like the TV we've now
got<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.400> red<00:01:44.610> standby<00:01:45.150> indicator<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.850> then

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
got a red standby indicator if we then

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.350 
got a red standby indicator if we then
turn<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> TV<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> remote<00:01:56.299> now<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
turn the TV on with the remote now the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.430 
turn the TV on with the remote now the
LED<00:01:57.600> goes<00:01:57.780> green<00:01:59.030> and<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> TV<00:02:00.539> powers<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:01.110> with

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
LED goes green and the TV powers up with

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.430 
LED goes green and the TV powers up with
in<00:02:01.590> show<00:02:01.830> order<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.729> hear<00:02:03.229> TV<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.289> now

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
in show order you can hear TV is now

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:15.830 
in show order you can hear TV is now
working<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:13.110> most<00:02:13.440> likely<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:15.239> 100<00:02:15.720> my

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
working so it's most likely the 100 my

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.540

it's fired up the pitch was okay we've

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.100

got a little bit of Merrill discharge

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.780

multiple<00:02:56.310> factors<00:02:58.370> okay<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.700> just<00:02:59.970> start<00:03:00.480> with

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
multiple factors okay we just start with

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.960 
multiple factors okay we just start with
a<00:03:00.780> has<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.829> cross<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> subtle<00:03:02.459> bit<00:03:02.549> one<00:03:02.790> will

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
a has to cross the subtle bit one will

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.270 
a has to cross the subtle bit one will
see<00:03:03.239> found<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.900> only<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.260> was<00:03:04.290> failed<00:03:04.859> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
see found that only one was failed so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.310 
see found that only one was failed so
their<00:03:06.120> capacitor<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.720> installed<00:03:07.140> across

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
their capacitor is installed across

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.259 
their capacitor is installed across
there<00:03:07.590> now<00:03:07.859> we're<00:03:08.190> measuring<00:03:08.370> nine<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> half

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
there now we're measuring nine a half

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:09.770 
there now we're measuring nine a half
volt

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
volt

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.380 
volt
it's<00:03:09.930> citral<00:03:10.680> instead<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.100> about<00:03:11.489> seven<00:03:12.000> volts

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's citral instead of about seven volts

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.990 
it's citral instead of about seven volts
after<00:03:12.720> warming<00:03:12.900> up<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.709> five<00:03:14.519> volts

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
after warming up and just five volts

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.920 
after warming up and just five volts
from<00:03:15.150> cold

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
from cold

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.890 
from cold
so<00:03:16.380> that's<00:03:16.739> fixed<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:17.430> TV<00:03:18.299> works<00:03:18.570> straight

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
so that's fixed now TV works straight

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.870 
so that's fixed now TV works straight
from<00:03:19.079> power<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.769> warm<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.220> cold<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
from power with a warm or cold so

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.759 
from power with a warm or cold so
everything's<00:03:21.780> happy<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:24.200> think<00:03:25.200> good<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.590> TV

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
everything's happy I think good on TV

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:36.770 
everything's happy I think good on TV
right<00:03:26.130> now<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.410> working

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.840
