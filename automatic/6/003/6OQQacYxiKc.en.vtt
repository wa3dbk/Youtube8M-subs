00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.000
 like the one in the video only appears in 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.670
 64-bit operating systems in those of 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:02.360
 32 bits will only say program file or 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:05.059

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.250
 refresh and finally in phase scan 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.380
 As you can see, the look has already appeared and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.210
 now all that remains is to mark it and close the fl 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.210

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.060
 we finish now we need to copy the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.159
 nexus content folder that is what we 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.100
 once again I remind you that if your 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.190
 operating system is not 64-bit single 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.410
 imagine that my program files folder 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.570
 x86 is the file folder of 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.850
 programs in your system 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.080
 the folder annexes content is copied 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.960
 local disk program files 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 I imagined line and fl studio 11 how can 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.010
 appreciate in the video 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:36.330

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 the folder is copied to advance the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.310
 process 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.739

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.879

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.020
 I will take advantage of being in the folder and 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.860
 open the fl from here 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.860

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.970
