 so 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.310
 heat your boil instead of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.710
 salt water and scented with cumin 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.420
 when the water is hot enough 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:19.080
 put your basmati rice there and leave 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.120
 cook gently during this rate this time 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.940
 pardon heat a little oil 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:31.430
 olive in your pan in oil 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.430
 is hot enough you put your audio 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 you let simmer a little while 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:47.430
 that we onions begins to become a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:51.619
 not very translucent like this 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.619
 stir in the zucchini slices 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.530
 and you mix all that and let yourself 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.110
 once again leather very slowly 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.520
 and do not forget during this time where 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.030
 your basmati rice 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 stir from time to time otherwise it will 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.310
 actually stick to the bottom of your 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 pan and it's a shame to be 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.040
 a few still so you stir 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.560
 sometimes stunned 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.350
 that's a lot so we're going back 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.230
 our hair and this time we go 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.879
 incorporate our blades l2 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.239
 chicken or dance for me 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.530
 it was turkey but sincerely so 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.269
 I had the choice I would have preferred 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.129
 chicken is more tender with the milk of 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.930
 coconut I find but hello with them from 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.299
 the deal that day so this is a man 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.769
 but it was very beautiful eh and you 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.330
 cook again like you 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.650
 have seen it I have not yet put 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.049
 no spices and it's done on purpose then 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.209
 there as you can see the turkey 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.549
 is half cooked and that's where we go 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.909
 put our coconut milk so that the 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.489
 cooked turkey cooked in coconut milk 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.290
 and in fact she will keep all her 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.230
 tenderness let's say inside everything 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.049
 his tender heart thanks to coconut milk 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.340
 so to put all our our box of 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.170
 preserve and for those who go to me 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.709
 ask where did I buy my 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.959
 coconut milk 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.459
 it's starting to be available a little 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.760
 everywhere in Algeria so it's great 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:22.829
 so here I am mixing all that 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.690
 roughly and I'm going to incorporate but 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.190
 spices gently gently and in fact 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.139
 it's done on purpose so that when 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.930
 they empty the coconut milk for 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.930
 reduce during cooking and all 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.220
 aromas of spices will come off then 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.290
 I put when you got you 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.970
 to notice a good dose of curry is 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.609
 because we love it but it was 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.510
 really according to the tastes then of the 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:47.720
 Sesame seeds 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.720
 salt and pepper 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.590
 no cumin cumin it was just for 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.390
 perfume basmati rice that is to say 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.239
 basmati rice water not fake master 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.489
 with the curry and you mix another one 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.590
 weight from bottom to top from bottom to bottom 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.030
 top story to bathe any voice 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.430
 all all your vegetables and all your 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.700
 meat with coconut milk flavored with 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.829
 all spices so you mix yourself 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.760
 mix and let everything simmer 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.380
 over medium heat that's it and you'll see that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.209
 the coconut milk will start to reduce 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.050
 gently gently to create a sauce 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.669
 creamy and that's the secret in fact 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.949
 it's because in fact this sauce 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.440
 creamy will make your meat hyper 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.990
 tender is a delight and when you 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.169
 have put your spices in the end they are going 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.979
 have time while the pendant 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.380
 that coconut milk reduce to clear 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.510
 all their aromas so here I tried 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.460
 to present to you suitably so 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:54.560
 I used to cookie cutter and I 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:01.630
 formed a round of rice and I placed my 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.630
 sauce over it so here you go 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.140
 so I really hope that the recipe 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.430
 you will have liked the girls I make you 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.020
