00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.529
 go to the flying fox 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 and let's go 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.989
 selection 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 in to the jungle that's what the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.290
 trailer finally battlefield official 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.820
 hard line yes sir every once in a while 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 well see something that has liquidated us 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.480
 although that is not technically true anymore 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.550
 than an hour before a twitter user 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 he uploaded this trailer his channel and by 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.699
 supposed electronic arts and tried 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.930
 minimize damage actually erased it 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.489
 like in 10 minutes pretty 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.870
 impressive but it seems that that was not 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.940
 enough for a lot of people to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 I saw what a few minutes later 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 video that will pull him out of them 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 in its official channel I do not know if because 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 They were scheduled or directly 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.089
 they were forced thanks to the link of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.440
 all ways as it is normal saw it 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.000
 a lot of people but something happened 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.770
 quite unusual in this video and it's that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.930
 the likes and dislike bar for about 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.000
 moments was pretty even then 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.770
 already normalized a bit but the truth 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 is that I had never seen a ratio of 8 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.920
 likes a dislike in one of the trailers 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.810
 debate the film in d lc is neither obviously 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 in battle it was 4 in fact bat felix 4 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.439
 had a very good reception and the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.510
 truth is that I was surprised by this 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.790
 detail and good this trailer the truth 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.380
 is that it was quite brief they were about 35 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.000
 clean seconds and in them we do not see 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.560
 nothing that we have not seen a couple of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.970
 details of the campaign and the rest the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 true quite normal as I say 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.060
 nevertheless a detail was revealed to us 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 quite important and it's going to be a 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.520
 hard line will be published on 21 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.899
 October 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.479
 of this year as many had already 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.369
 speculated apart from that as you already know 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's see another trailer and a beta 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.000
 playable on e3 and that is precisely 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.380
 what I had planned to talk about today 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.939
 that by the time you see this video 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.319
 We will be only two days away from 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.909
 Enjoy one of the most events 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.679
 important for video games every 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.060
 year with which I wanted to give you my list of 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.619
 the games that I most expect to see the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.929
 right above you'll have a little bit of 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.189
 information about the company the date 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.750
 of the conference and the date on which 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.490
 it is supposed to come out anyway 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.229
 I suppose you are also 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 interested in other titles so I os 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.259
 I'm going to leave the list of streaming in 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.940
 tweets through which 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.530
 will relay these conferences in the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.209
 description but good let's go to the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.340
 list and first of all we would have the 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.630
 highly anticipated star wars battlefront a 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.579
 series of games that had been a 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.049
 little abandoned after many years since 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.579
 your last delivery at least one 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.709
 relevant platform since it has had 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.239
 several representatives for psp and 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.190
 portable consoles in general but 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.170
 We can say that we have been doing for 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 almost nine years waiting for it to continue 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.250
 this series on let's say on the big console 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.560
 not anyway I suppose I'll have you 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 left a very short trailer of the e3 of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.879
 2013 when we were able to get a short 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.440
 look at this title which as I already 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.180
 you will have seen will be developed 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 by our favorite company 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.530
 which will use its graphics engine 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.120
 frostbite r if said engine in turn is 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.609
 one of the things that most concern me 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.420
 Since we have been seven months 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.250
 delighting in the wonderful 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.010
 result of this engine notice the irony 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.719
 there are three of the frob so let's hope that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.609
 they can fix it and give us a title 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.620
 of starwars up to the next 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.150
 game that we are going to talk about will be one 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.739
 that it is evident that he would be 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.359
 really we've all been moved by what 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.980
 that we've seen from one of the most games 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.480
 pioneers and interesting that we have seen 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.639
 by ubisoft in years tom 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.109
 clancy's division is that much 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.639
 impression I think when it was said that 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.400
 it was only going to be available for xbox 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.959
 one and playstation 4 a request was created 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.730
 to bring it to pc and we know 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.889
 how these requests usually end but 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.629
 however it seems that ubisoft looked 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.099
 overwhelmed by the amount of people that the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.599
 signed among others of course a 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.969
 server but hey what's the game 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.530
 So basically split is a game 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.150
 oriented to the multiplayer in which we 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.889
 we will find on a stage between 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.209
 post-apocalyptic quotes in the city 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.040
 from new york so I understand 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.019
 who we find an environment 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.189
 quite interesting to discover and 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.230
 probably one of the best 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.939
 real scenarios for a game and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.650
 relative to something that this is a 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.879
 real scenario although I really do not know 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.150
 how much will it be since it can 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.069
 to have 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.360
 different but well this is one thing 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.400
 that made me quite funny and is that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.750
 imagine that you are colleagues who 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.310
 live in new york 'and you usually stay 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.569
 to play games and such the truth is 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.400
 that would be pretty cool to tell your 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.720
 colleagues that stayed at my house but 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.280
 this time inside the game the truth is 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.379
 that would be pretty cool and something else 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.299
 that is cool at least is an engine 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.799
 graphic called snow drop which has been 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.900
 already shown more than what is capable 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.400
 to get and I assure you get 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.590
 amazing things leaving a base 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.299
 great for division is one 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.759
 of the most anticipated titles in this 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.470
 case 2015 in the next place of my 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.510
 list we would have the mid ehlers already of 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.100
 bite a pretty revealing name for 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.570
 the fans of the Lord of the Rings' that 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.610
 we will receive a game based on your 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.530
 thematic this October and really this 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.910
 game is not it's relatively too much 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.410
 well-known is not too innovative 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.300
 in its theme but in what it is 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.190
 innovative is in the part of a new 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.320
 system that the monkey developers 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.090
 lizán have baptized as the system 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.680
 nemesis through which practically 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.419
 each battle could be different from the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.889
 another thanks to the characters for 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.080
 example and among many other things 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.880
 they remember other of their battles and their 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.650
 result the main character of 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.900
 shadow of bite would be talion to which 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.270
 they have snatched his family and condemned 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.250
 to be united to a spirit called wife 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.900
 we can separate ourselves by killing whoever 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.370
 joined that in turn is the one that killed 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.450
 our family and well we already see that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.980
 Of course the story is pretty 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.540
 interesting at least for me the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.980
 graphics are not bad either, even though the 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.840
 video is of a pretty bad quality and 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.490
 since I say this, I also have to 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.960
 comment that this is the reason why 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.090
 This video is not as 4k 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.980
 custom since it is and rsc to what these 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.080
 trailers the video would look pretty 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.450
 pretty bad anyway with a 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.890
 trailer to 720 pixelated or not for my a 2 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.530
 biting will be one of the essential 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.120
 this year and to finish with the 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.590
 list we would have one of the games of 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.060
 those that most secretly has remained 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.580
 your details at the moment we can only 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.260
 know what farcry 4 is confirmed for 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.940
 on November 21 of this year and I 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.230
 being an unconditional fan of 3 the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.640
 which I have passed about 4 times 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.920
 enjoying more and more than the previous 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.530
 it's going to be one of the most anticipated games 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.180
 of this three and the year in general and 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.710
 good kids that would be all my list and 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.150
 as it is evident this is mine and it is a 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.620
 top there are really many more games to 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150
 those who pay attention to some of 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.890
 which you have on the screen titles 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.330
 like for example to see if I say it well 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.790
 because it's pretty hard to tell the 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.260
 least for me mirror sets 2 of which I 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.550
 loved the first part some games 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.710
 also driving that look like 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.360
 to innovate as a cross or drive club and 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.630
 some exclusive titles the next and in 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.980
 as 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.230
 sting and that obviously have not caused me 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.550
 so much interest since I will not be able to 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.800
 enjoy anyway I would like 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.990
 that this video also served to 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.250
 do a kind of poll of which 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.930
 are the games where you are most 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.970
 interested so I would ask you if 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.860
 can you leave me your top 5 in the 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.630
 comments is and make us all an idea 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.780
 of what we want to see in general so 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.200
 I said goodbye goodbye 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.200
 kids
