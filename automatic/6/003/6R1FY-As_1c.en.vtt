her what the origin of the hair was

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.330 
her what the origin of the hair was
because<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> had<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.260> few<00:03:55.530> people<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.950> act<00:03:56.130> to

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
to disclose the origin because a lot of

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.650 
to disclose the origin because a lot of
companies<00:04:07.380> have<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.889> been<00:04:08.100> abusing<00:04:08.660> you

companies have like been abusing you
know<00:04:09.780> different<00:04:09.959> origins<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.889> basically

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
know different origins like basically

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740 
know different origins like basically
saying<00:04:11.609> so<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.239> instance<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.569> feels

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
saying so for instance it feels

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.870 
saying so for instance it feels
brazilian<00:04:13.350> hair<00:04:13.680> or<00:04:14.340> whatever<00:04:14.670> orifice

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
brazilian hair or whatever orifice

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.670 
brazilian hair or whatever orifice
chinese<00:04:15.510> hair<00:04:15.780> they'll<00:04:16.019> pass<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.560> off<00:04:16.650> as

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
chinese hair they'll pass it off as

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.620 
chinese hair they'll pass it off as
Brazilian<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.970> decided<00:04:18.359> not<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.930> release

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
Brazilian so they decided not to release

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.630 
Brazilian so they decided not to release
like<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:20.050> origin<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.770> hair<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.459> don't

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
like the origin of the hair and I don't

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.680 
like the origin of the hair and I don't
really<00:04:21.790> think<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.120> makes<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.510> difference

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
really think that makes a difference

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.780 
really think that makes a difference
because<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.200> hair<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.440> soft<00:04:23.920> I'm<00:04:24.250> getting

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
because the hair is soft I'm getting

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.120 
because the hair is soft I'm getting
absolutely<00:04:25.120> no<00:04:25.600> tangling<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.620> did<00:04:26.860> car

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
absolutely no tangling it but I did car

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.490 
absolutely no tangling it but I did car
wash<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.520> so<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.210> natural<00:04:28.390> wave<00:04:28.810> of

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
wash it so this is the natural wave of

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.280 
wash it so this is the natural wave of
the<00:04:29.710> hair<00:04:29.980> but<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:30.700> did<00:04:31.210> co<00:04:31.510> wash<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:32.050> and

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
the hair but I did co wash it and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.440 
the hair but I did co wash it and
everything<00:04:32.710> I'm<00:04:33.010> getting<00:04:33.190> like<00:04:33.940> maybe<00:04:34.180> like

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
everything I'm getting like maybe like

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.930 
everything I'm getting like maybe like
one<00:04:35.200> strand<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:36.070> y'all<00:04:36.220> when<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.490> say<00:04:36.730> that's

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
one strand but y'all when I say that's

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.600 
one strand but y'all when I say that's
nothing<00:04:37.420> it's<00:04:37.900> really<00:04:38.260> nothing<00:04:38.560> because<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
nothing it's really nothing because the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.660 
nothing it's really nothing because the
hair<00:04:39.790> is<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.180> freaking<00:04:40.870> solved<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.380> um<00:04:41.740> this

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
hair is so freaking solved and um this

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.170 
hair is so freaking solved and um this
is<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.030> 22<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.590> 24<00:04:44.590> inch<00:04:44.860> bundle<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.030> me

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
is the 22 to 24 inch bundle but to me

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.690 
is the 22 to 24 inch bundle but to me
this<00:04:46.390> looks<00:04:46.450> way<00:04:47.050> way<00:04:47.290> longer<00:04:47.590> than<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.950> um<00:04:48.250> I

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
this looks way way longer than that um I

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.490 
this looks way way longer than that um I
haven't<00:04:49.150> measured<00:04:49.510> it<00:04:49.810> out<00:04:49.930> but<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.200> made

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
haven't measured it out but I made

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.140 
haven't measured it out but I made
measure<00:04:50.770> just<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.400> see<00:04:51.520> what<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.910> true

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
measure just and see what the true

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.030 
measure just and see what the true
length<00:04:52.360> is<00:04:52.570> because<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:52.960> hair<00:04:53.170> looks<00:04:53.410> super

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
length is because this hair looks super

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.030 
length is because this hair looks super
super<00:04:54.310> duper<00:04:54.550> long<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.570> got<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.990> 22<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.650> 24

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
super duper long and I got to 22 to 24

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.070 
super duper long and I got to 22 to 24
inch<00:04:57.250> bundles<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:57.910> then<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.360> also<00:04:58.570> received

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
inch bundles and then I also received

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.560 
inch bundles and then I also received
like<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.590> said<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.920> 18<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.520> 20<00:05:00.850> inch<00:05:01.060> bundle

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
like I said that 18 to 20 inch bundle

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.640 
like I said that 18 to 20 inch bundle
and<00:05:02.040> that's<00:05:03.040> this<00:05:03.340> one<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.210> even<00:05:04.930> this<00:05:05.200> one<00:05:05.500> is

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
and that's this one and even this one is

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.950 
and that's this one and even this one is
like<00:05:05.800> long<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:07.240> here's<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.690> side-by-side

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
like long so here's a side-by-side

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.730 
like long so here's a side-by-side
comparison<00:05:08.730> this<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.150> 22<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:10.690> 24<00:05:11.410> inch

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
comparison this is the 22 to 24 inch

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.040 
comparison this is the 22 to 24 inch
here<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.430> then<00:05:12.580> this<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.970> 18<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.600> 20<00:05:13.870> inch

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
here and then this is the 18 to 20 inch

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.620 
here and then this is the 18 to 20 inch
here<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.560> y'all<00:05:15.100> when<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:15.850> think<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:16.480> like

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
here and y'all when I think it's like

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.180 
here and y'all when I think it's like
she<00:05:16.840> may<00:05:17.020> have<00:05:17.230> given<00:05:17.380> me<00:05:17.680> more<00:05:17.860> length

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
she may have given me more length

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.450 
she may have given me more length
because<00:05:18.640> it's<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:19.930> long<00:05:20.260> I'm<00:05:20.740> not<00:05:20.950> complaining

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
because it's so long I'm not complaining

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.330 
because it's so long I'm not complaining
about<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.910> but<00:05:22.120> you<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.230> your<00:05:23.500> length<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:24.160> are

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
about it but you in your length you are
