00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
back home well that was close enough i

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
back home well that was close enough i
guess<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> messed<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.700> with

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
guess because it kind of messed up with

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880 
guess because it kind of messed up with
the<00:01:32.850> dot-com<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.439> kind<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the dot-com right there but you kind of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
the dot-com right there but you kind of
know<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> microphone<00:01:35.850> does<00:01:36.060> work<00:01:36.299> good

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
know that the microphone does work good

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
know that the microphone does work good
and<00:01:36.840> overall<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:38.130> impressed<00:01:38.490> with

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and overall I'm really impressed with

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.149 
and overall I'm really impressed with
this<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.240> mean<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.259> using<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.619> earlier<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
this I mean I was using it earlier and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
this I mean I was using it earlier and
it<00:01:41.280> worked<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.150> maybe<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.630> doesn't<00:01:42.810> work

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it worked well but maybe it doesn't work

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.389 
it worked well but maybe it doesn't work
as<00:01:43.170> well<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.189> basement
