00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
or not will admit to having had some

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.810 
or not will admit to having had some
level<00:00:53.299> of<00:00:53.420> infidelity<00:00:53.949> sometime<00:00:54.949> during<00:00:55.549> that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
level of infidelity sometime during that

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.729 
level of infidelity sometime during that
relationship<00:00:56.449> that's<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.110> huge<00:00:57.470> amount

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
relationship that's a huge amount

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.920 
relationship that's a huge amount
actually<00:00:58.159> that's<00:00:58.580> again<00:00:59.269> that's<00:00:59.449> both<00:00:59.659> men

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
actually that's again that's both men

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.549 
actually that's again that's both men
and<00:01:00.110> women

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
and women

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.469 
and women
I<00:01:00.589> think<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.040> stats<00:01:01.280> are<00:01:01.489> like<00:01:01.790> 2<00:01:02.150> or<00:01:02.299> 3

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
I think the stats are like 2 or 3

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.850 
I think the stats are like 2 or 3
percent<00:01:02.600> higher<00:01:02.960> for<00:01:03.260> men<00:01:03.379> than<00:01:03.500> they<00:01:03.589> are<00:01:03.680> for

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
percent higher for men than they are for

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.590 
percent higher for men than they are for
women<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:04.460> not<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.790> much<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.239> women<00:01:05.510> are

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
women but not that much and women are

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.840 
women but not that much and women are
actually<00:01:05.690> catching<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.130> way<00:01:07.250> it's<00:01:07.729> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually catching up the way it's the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.250 
actually catching up the way it's the
great<00:01:08.000> arms<00:01:08.299> race<00:01:08.510> who<00:01:08.690> can<00:01:08.840> cheat<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.049> most

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
great arms race who can cheat the most

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.459 
great arms race who can cheat the most
um<00:01:10.420> just<00:01:11.420> because<00:01:11.600> somebody<00:01:11.869> cheese<00:01:12.229> does

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
um just because somebody cheese does

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.649 
um just because somebody cheese does
necessarily<00:01:12.619> mean<00:01:13.009> they<00:01:13.159> are<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.659> ongoing

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
necessarily mean they are a ongoing

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.899 
necessarily mean they are a ongoing
cheater<00:01:15.259> for<00:01:15.560> ever<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:15.979> ever<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.340> ever<00:01:16.399> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
cheater for ever and ever and ever the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.310 
cheater for ever and ever and ever the
number<00:01:17.149> one<00:01:17.270> piece<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.450> advice<00:01:17.689> I<00:01:17.840> can<00:01:17.899> give<00:01:18.109> is

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
number one piece of advice I can give is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.410 
number one piece of advice I can give is
if<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:18.680> many<00:01:18.859> cheats<00:01:19.009> once<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:20.180> not<00:01:20.299> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
if so many cheats once that is not the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.029 
if so many cheats once that is not the
death<00:01:20.570> knell<00:01:20.719> of<00:01:20.840> your<00:01:20.960> relationship<00:01:21.469> if<00:01:21.859> they

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
death knell of your relationship if they

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.370 
death knell of your relationship if they
achieve<00:01:22.280> multiple<00:01:22.850> times<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.630> probably<00:01:24.170> is

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
achieve multiple times that probably is

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.929 
achieve multiple times that probably is
if<00:01:24.890> they're<00:01:25.070> showing<00:01:25.399> themselves<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.850> be

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
if they're showing themselves to be

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.880 
if they're showing themselves to be
somebody<00:01:26.299> who<00:01:26.479> cannot<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:27.020> trusted<00:01:27.229> again<00:01:27.530> and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
somebody who cannot be trusted again and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.770 
somebody who cannot be trusted again and
again<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.310> again<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.880> probably<00:01:29.359> means<00:01:29.659> you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
again and again that probably means you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.120 
again and again that probably means you
should<00:01:29.929> find<00:01:30.109> somebody<00:01:30.409> else<00:01:30.679> not<00:01:30.859> being<00:01:31.039> that

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
should find somebody else not being that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.230 
should find somebody else not being that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
relation right infidelity is not the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.539 
relation right infidelity is not the
reason<00:01:35.240> for<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:36.100> relationship<00:01:37.100> breaking<00:01:37.460> up

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549
