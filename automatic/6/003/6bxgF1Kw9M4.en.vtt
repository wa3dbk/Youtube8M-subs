how<00:00:44.969> drastic<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> difference<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> makes<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
how drastic of a difference it makes I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
how drastic of a difference it makes I
think<00:00:47.100> personally<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.300> incredible

I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.200> necessary<00:00:49.680> perk<00:00:49.950> but

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
I think it's a very necessary perk but

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.619 
I think it's a very necessary perk but
you<00:00:50.460> guys<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> course<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> decide<00:00:51.570> for

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.869 
you guys of course get to decide for
yourself<00:00:52.079> how<00:00:52.289> useful<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> without

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
yourself how useful it is without

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
yourself how useful it is without
further<00:00:54.149> ado<00:00:54.329> we're<00:00:54.449> gonna<00:00:54.570> hop<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:55.379> some

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
little private match demonstrations of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139 
little private match demonstrations of
how<00:00:57.899> effective<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> you'll<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.879> seeing

in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.570> first<00:01:00.930> view<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> each<00:01:01.620> example<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.370> will

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
in the first view of each example I will

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
in the first view of each example I will
not<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.210> using<00:01:03.329> focus<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.229> we

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
not be using focus and then as we

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
not be using focus and then as we
transition<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.549> gonna<00:01:05.700> see<00:01:05.970> with

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
transition here you're gonna see with

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940 
transition here you're gonna see with
focus<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.200> shot<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> foot<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
focus I get shot in the foot with a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
focus I get shot in the foot with a
sniper<00:01:08.220> once<00:01:08.640> again<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> hardly

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
sniper once again and there is hardly

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539 
sniper once again and there is hardly
any<00:01:10.260> kick<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.340> tell

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
any kick so right there you can tell

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.280 
any kick so right there you can tell
there's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> big<00:01:11.970> difference<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.930> further

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there's a big difference but to further

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
there's a big difference but to further
prove<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> guys<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.369> went<00:01:14.610> ahead<00:01:14.670> and

prove it to you guys I went ahead and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
prove it to you guys I went ahead and
use<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.720> photoshop<00:01:16.320> capabilities

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
and I went ahead and cut out a version

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
and I went ahead and cut out a version
of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> gun<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.770> light<00:01:19.979> blue<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.460> see

here<00:01:40.200> we're<00:01:40.350> talking<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:41.400> we're

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
here we're talking about what we're

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.609 
here we're talking about what we're
looking<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.270> sidekick<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
looking at some sidekick and this is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.719 
looking at some sidekick and this is
different<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:44.670> in

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
different this is kind of when you're in

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.010 
different this is kind of when you're in
a<00:01:44.790> gunfight<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.570> getting<00:01:45.689> shot<00:01:45.810> on

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
a gunfight and you're getting shot on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.270 
a gunfight and you're getting shot on
the<00:01:46.110> side<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> throw<00:01:46.829> off<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.009> aim

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the side and that can throw off your aim

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
the side and that can throw off your aim
to<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.899> focus<00:01:48.899> doesn't<00:01:49.170> make<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.380> big<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
to and focus doesn't make as big of a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
to and focus doesn't make as big of a
difference<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.939> course<00:01:51.299> still

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
difference here it is of course still

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.560 
difference here it is of course still
useful<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> will<00:01:52.920> note<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.490> focus<00:01:54.450> is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
useful but I will note that focus is

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.850 
useful but I will note that focus is
most<00:01:54.810> useful<00:01:54.899> when<00:01:55.320> you're<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.619> head-on

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
most useful when you're in a head-on

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
most useful when you're in a head-on
gunfight<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> taking<00:01:57.149> damage<00:01:57.329> from<00:01:57.509> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
gunfight and taking damage from that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.810 
gunfight and taking damage from that
person<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.100> her<00:01:59.250> once<00:01:59.490> again

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
person you can see her once again

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
person you can see her once again
sidekick<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.780> interesting<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.590> makes

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
sidekick is interesting because it makes

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.429 
sidekick is interesting because it makes
your<00:02:01.860> gun<00:02:02.070> actually<00:02:02.549> rotate<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.840> left<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
your gun actually rotate to the left and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.139 
your gun actually rotate to the left and
so<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.740> why<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> gun<00:02:05.280> looks<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.729> tilted

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
so that's why the gun looks so tilted

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
so that's why the gun looks so tilted
and<00:02:06.240> weird<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> picture<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.890> is

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and weird in this picture but that is

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.949 
and weird in this picture but that is
where<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.280> originally<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.819> pointing<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.539> its

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
where it originally was pointing at its

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.380 
where it originally was pointing at its
farthest<00:02:10.830> point<00:02:11.039> from<00:02:11.160> its<00:02:11.459> center<00:02:11.819> when<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
farthest point from its center when you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.880 
farthest point from its center when you
are<00:02:12.569> you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
are you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.440 
are you
the<00:02:13.100> perfect<00:02:13.370> focus<00:02:13.670> after<00:02:13.850> you've<00:02:14.270> been

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
the perfect focus after you've been

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.180 
the perfect focus after you've been
taking<00:02:14.810> damage<00:02:15.020> now<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.410> course<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.830> these

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
taking damage now of course in these

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.090 
taking damage now of course in these
demonstrations<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.810> been<00:02:18.050> being<00:02:18.800> shot

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
demonstrations I have been being shot

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340 
demonstrations I have been being shot
I've<00:02:19.940> been<00:02:20.000> being<00:02:20.330> shot<00:02:20.569> by<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.810> sniper<00:02:20.959> rifle

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
I've been being shot by a sniper rifle

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.080 
I've been being shot by a sniper rifle
in<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.709> foot<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:22.880> about<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
in the foot and it's just about the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.080 
in the foot and it's just about the
maximum<00:02:23.720> amount<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.020> damage<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.770> take

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
maximum amount of damage you can take

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.150 
maximum amount of damage you can take
without<00:02:26.090> being<00:02:26.690> killed<00:02:27.080> from<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.620> bullets<00:02:27.950> so

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
without being killed from the bullets so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.460 
without being killed from the bullets so
this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.270> most<00:02:29.390> drastic<00:02:29.630> example<00:02:30.380> you

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
this is the most drastic example you

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.449 
this is the most drastic example you
know<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.860> course<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.130> you're<00:02:31.190> getting

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
know of course if you're getting

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.030 
know of course if you're getting
pelleted<00:02:31.910> by<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.170> pistol<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.560> differences

pelleted by a pistol the differences
aren't<00:02:34.250> going<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.520> be<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.820> great<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.420> when

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
aren't going to be that great but when

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.180 
aren't going to be that great but when
you<00:02:35.690> are<00:02:35.840> going<00:02:36.110> up<00:02:36.200> against<00:02:36.530> assault<00:02:36.830> rifles

lmg sniper rifles focus is going to be
absolutely<00:02:40.370> essential<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.600> found<00:02:41.930> when<00:02:42.230> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
absolutely essential and I found when I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.140 
absolutely essential and I found when I
was<00:02:42.470> playing<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:42.980> first<00:02:43.280> 20<00:02:43.610> levels<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:44.000> so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
was playing in my first 20 levels or so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
was playing in my first 20 levels or so
of<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:44.480> game<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.900> was<00:02:45.350> struggling<00:02:45.620> quite<00:02:45.950> a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
of this game I was struggling quite a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.560 
of this game I was struggling quite a
bit<00:02:46.220> because<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.520> wasn't<00:02:46.910> using<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.420> perk

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
bit because I wasn't using the perk

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.990 
bit because I wasn't using the perk
focus<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.140> reason<00:02:48.680> for<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:48.980> was<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.550> was<00:02:49.850> not

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
focus a reason for this was I was not

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.509 
focus a reason for this was I was not
aware<00:02:50.150> how<00:02:50.510> useful<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.989> was<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:52.190> originally

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
aware how useful it was and I originally

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.500 
aware how useful it was and I originally
thought<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.030> wouldn't<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.390> great

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
thought it wouldn't be that great

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.910 
thought it wouldn't be that great
because<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.840> wasn't<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.170> useful<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.680> modern

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
because it wasn't that useful in modern

because it wasn't that useful in modern

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
board game that was released so I went

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.490 
board game that was released so I went
ahead<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.330> kind<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.540> skimmed<00:02:59.840> over<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.290> but

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
ahead and kind of skimmed over it but

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.770 
ahead and kind of skimmed over it but
