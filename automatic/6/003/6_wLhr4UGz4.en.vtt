00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
defeat although I'm sure it's not

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
defeat although I'm sure it's not
actually<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> money<00:01:04.680> even<00:01:05.129> though<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually a lot of money even though it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
actually a lot of money even though it
was<00:01:05.640> five<00:01:05.880> thousand<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> five<00:01:06.630> thousand

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
was five thousand to five thousand

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
was five thousand to five thousand
dollars<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.310> korean<00:01:08.670> won<00:01:08.820> or

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
dollars but i don't think korean won or

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.039 
dollars but i don't think korean won or
actually<00:01:09.360> worth<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.260> anyway<00:01:12.049> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
actually worth that much so anyway it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
actually worth that much so anyway it
looks<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.100> far<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> only

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
looks like and so far the only

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
looks like and so far the only
disappointing<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.540> from<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> series

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
disappointing for me from the series

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.600 
disappointing for me from the series
even<00:01:16.470> though<00:01:16.560> i<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> quality<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
even though i think the quality of the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
even though i think the quality of the
play<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:17.909> been<00:01:18.060> spectacular<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.930> execution

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
play has been spectacular the execution

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
play has been spectacular the execution
has<00:01:20.250> been<00:01:20.280> perfect<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.659> both<00:01:21.900> these<00:01:22.140> guys

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
has been perfect and both these guys

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
has been perfect and both these guys
have<00:01:22.740> been<00:01:22.979> pushed<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> their<00:01:23.490> limits<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
have been pushed to their limits and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
have been pushed to their limits and
really<00:01:24.960> flash<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.680> being<00:01:25.890> challenged<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
really flash is being challenged in a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
really flash is being challenged in a
way<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.360> i'm<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.570> sure<00:01:27.780> he<00:01:28.140> expected<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> be

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
way that i'm not sure he expected to be

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.380 
way that i'm not sure he expected to be
he's<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.460> being<00:01:29.640> made<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> play<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
he's really being made to play and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
he's really being made to play and
really<00:01:30.630> bring<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.079> earn<00:01:31.350> his<00:01:31.890> victory<00:01:32.340> so

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
really bring me to earn his victory so

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
really bring me to earn his victory so
far<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.090> matchup<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> only

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
far in this matchup but the only

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.710 
far in this matchup but the only
disappointing<00:01:35.070> thing<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.400> me<00:01:35.490> has<00:01:35.610> been<00:01:35.720> i

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
disappointing thing for me has been i

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
disappointing thing for me has been i
suppose<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.530> repetitiveness<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.490> has

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
suppose the repetitiveness that has

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.660

to he has to pull it out of the bag and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.460 
to he has to pull it out of the bag and
I<00:03:50.970> guess<00:03:51.419> he<00:03:51.569> has<00:03:51.750> confidence<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.380> himself

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
I guess he has confidence in himself

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.110 
I guess he has confidence in himself
that<00:03:52.799> he<00:03:53.010> keeps<00:03:53.370> doing<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.639> same<00:03:53.760> thing<00:03:54.030> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
that he keeps doing the same thing and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.420 
that he keeps doing the same thing and
the<00:03:54.239> thing<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.569> suppose<00:03:55.019> he<00:03:55.470> has<00:03:56.220> been

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the thing that I suppose he has been

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.640 
the thing that I suppose he has been
comfortable<00:03:56.879> doing<00:03:57.060> with<00:03:57.269> thus<00:03:57.419> far<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.500> he

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
comfortable doing with thus far that he

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.229 
comfortable doing with thus far that he
will<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.829> able<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.099> pull<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.370> out<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.579> push<00:04:00.120> it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
will be able to pull it out and push it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.879 
will be able to pull it out and push it
into<00:04:00.389> a<00:04:00.480> final<00:04:00.810> matchup<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.739> would

this<00:04:20.310> we're<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.120> best<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.390> five<00:04:21.450> players

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
this we're in a best of five players

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.990 
this we're in a best of five players
went<00:04:22.289> for<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.469> exact<00:04:22.770> same<00:04:23.039> build<00:04:23.400> again<00:04:23.760> and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
went for the exact same build again and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.080 
went for the exact same build again and
again<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.390> again

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
again and again

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.850 
again and again
and<00:04:27.090> considering<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.200> course<00:04:28.380> my<00:04:28.470> salt<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:28.740> saw

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and considering of course my salt we saw

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.680 
and considering of course my salt we saw
the<00:04:28.920> three<00:04:29.160> hutch<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:30.090> had<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:30.480> saw<00:04:30.630> the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
the three hutch we had you saw the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.040 
the three hutch we had you saw the
typical<00:04:31.110> three<00:04:31.260> hatch<00:04:31.410> builds<00:04:31.710> from<00:04:31.830> jay<00:04:32.010> da

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
typical three hatch builds from jay da

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.840 
typical three hatch builds from jay da
in<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.590> first<00:04:34.800> game<00:04:35.010> versus<00:04:35.340> flash<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.790> then

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
in the first game versus flash and then

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.580 
in the first game versus flash and then
and<00:04:36.330> then<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.600> course<00:04:36.630> we<00:04:36.870> never<00:04:36.960> got<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.470> see

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
and then of course we never got to see

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.840 
and then of course we never got to see
what<00:04:37.770> his<00:04:37.919> 12<00:04:38.190> hatch<00:04:38.310> would<00:04:38.430> have<00:04:38.520> gone<00:04:38.639> into

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
what his 12 hatch would have gone into

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.790 
what his 12 hatch would have gone into
in<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.240> second<00:04:39.570> game<00:04:39.660> he<00:04:40.410> really<00:04:40.680> found

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
in the second game he really found

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.920 
in the second game he really found
himself<00:04:40.980> in<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.340> lot<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.610> trouble<00:04:41.880> early<00:04:42.090> on<00:04:42.240> and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
himself in a lot of trouble early on and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.470 
himself in a lot of trouble early on and
that<00:04:43.320> was<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.430> am<00:04:44.700> I'm<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.120> little<00:04:45.389> bit

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
that was it but I am I'm a little bit

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.090 
that was it but I am I'm a little bit
surprised<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.780> see<00:04:45.960> neither<00:04:46.260> player<00:04:46.590> various

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
surprised to see neither player various

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.250 
surprised to see neither player various
strategy<00:04:47.490> or<00:04:47.580> trying<00:04:47.790> anything<00:04:48.030> risky<00:04:48.360> or

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
strategy or trying anything risky or

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.640 
strategy or trying anything risky or
anything<00:04:49.889> extremely<00:04:50.340> risky<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:51.470> suppose<00:04:52.470> some

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
anything extremely risky I suppose some

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.409 
anything extremely risky I suppose some
might<00:04:52.680> argue<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:53.130> 12<00:04:53.610> hatch<00:04:53.760> in<00:04:53.940> them<00:04:54.060> itself

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
might argue that 12 hatch in them itself

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.790 
might argue that 12 hatch in them itself
isn't<00:04:55.490> really<00:04:57.080> something<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.290> would<00:04:58.470> expect

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
isn't really something you would expect

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800 
isn't really something you would expect
to<00:04:59.100> use<00:04:59.280> consistently<00:05:00.060> again<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.630> again

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
to use consistently again and again

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.350 
to use consistently again and again
against<00:05:01.110> flash<00:05:01.440> but<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.520> seems<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:03.000> seems<00:05:03.180> to

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
against flash but it seems it seems to

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.960 
against flash but it seems it seems to
be<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.570> bill<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:04.020> calm<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.800> gone<00:05:04.980> for<00:05:05.310> and
