arch and i'm going to show you the one

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.550 
arch and i'm going to show you the one
with<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.620> trapdoors<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.109> tribe<00:03:28.290> do<00:03:28.440> is

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
with the trapdoors so the tribe do is

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.960 
with the trapdoors so the tribe do is
you<00:03:28.620> want<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.799> keep<00:03:28.980> them<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.609> same<00:03:29.760> side

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
you want to keep them on the same side

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.809 
you want to keep them on the same side
so<00:03:30.209> when<00:03:30.359> they<00:03:30.480> open<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.019> want<00:03:31.199> them

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
so when they open you want them

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.699 
so when they open you want them
on<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.209> same<00:03:32.540> size<00:03:32.810> his<00:03:33.109> you<00:03:33.260> put<00:03:33.409> on<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
on the same size his you put on the

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.160 
on the same size his you put on the
opposite<00:03:34.129> side<00:03:34.370> may<00:03:34.939> be<00:03:34.999> more<00:03:35.390> complicated<00:03:35.840> to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
opposite side may be more complicated to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.000 
opposite side may be more complicated to
enter<00:03:36.530> than<00:03:36.769> normal<00:03:37.810> because<00:03:38.829> there's<00:03:39.829> like<00:03:39.980> a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
enter than normal because there's like a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.759 
enter than normal because there's like a
sign<00:03:40.909> a<00:03:40.939> half<00:03:41.209> block<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.049> think<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.680> like

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
sign a half block but I think it's like

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.309 
sign a half block but I think it's like
a<00:03:42.799> quarter<00:03:43.280> block<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.879> a<00:03:44.030> block<00:03:44.299> seat<00:03:44.569> so<00:03:45.260> you

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
a quarter block and a block seat so you

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.229 
a quarter block and a block seat so you
can<00:03:45.439> see<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.620> felt<00:03:46.069> placing<00:03:46.489> my<00:03:46.609> paintings

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
can see I felt placing my paintings

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.750 
can see I felt placing my paintings
before<00:03:47.420> if<00:03:48.379> you<00:03:48.560> fell<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.859> want<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.430> retry

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
before if you fell you want to retry

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.209 
before if you fell you want to retry
break<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.389> retry<00:03:50.840> just<00:03:51.620> keep<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.950> doing

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
break it and retry just keep on doing

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.270 
break it and retry just keep on doing
that<00:03:52.370> until<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.480> get<00:03:53.689> it<00:03:54.040> because<00:03:55.040> the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
that until you get it because the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.830 
that until you get it because the
paintings<00:03:55.700> are<00:03:55.849> just<00:03:56.060> random<00:03:56.239> lines<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:56.810> can

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
paintings are just random lines you can

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.780 
paintings are just random lines you can
choose<00:03:57.379> what<00:03:57.650> thinking<00:03:58.040> putting<00:03:58.489> down

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
choose what thinking putting down

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.270 
choose what thinking putting down
there's<00:03:59.719> not<00:03:59.959> exactly<00:04:00.139> like<00:04:00.859> a<00:04:00.889> sort<00:04:01.219> of

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
there's not exactly like a sort of

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.020 
there's not exactly like a sort of
painting<00:04:01.719> so<00:04:02.719> the<00:04:03.049> so<00:04:03.560> as<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.709> as<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.310> can<00:04:04.639> see

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
painting so the so as you as you can see

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.080 
painting so the so as you as you can see
I<00:04:05.269> have<00:04:06.049> crossed<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.069> trapdoor<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.879> does

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
I have crossed in the trapdoor it does
