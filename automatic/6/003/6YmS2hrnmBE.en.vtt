pathophysiology of swag swag genealogy
swagger<00:00:09.780> Genesis<00:00:10.139> right<00:00:12.230> alright<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.910> let's

do it okay so when am i how is it mi
difference<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:21.359> harp<00:00:21.570> it

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.499 

so<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.400> Muslim<00:00:25.760> meet<00:00:28.300> cool

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
so the Muslim meet cool

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.350 
so the Muslim meet cool
an<00:00:29.570> mi<00:00:30.170> can<00:00:30.710> lead<00:00:31.039> to<00:00:31.340> penis<00:00:31.670> partners<00:00:32.210> that's

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
an mi can lead to penis partners that's

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.610 
an mi can lead to penis partners that's
good<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.809> lot<00:00:32.989> of<00:00:33.020> drugs<00:00:33.670> will<00:00:34.670> be<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.000> same

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
good so a lot of drugs will be the same

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.970 
good so a lot of drugs will be the same
after<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.710> end<00:00:37.750> but<00:00:38.750> what's<00:00:39.470> really

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
after the end but what's really

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.400 
after the end but what's really
happening<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.760> heart<00:00:41.000> right<00:00:41.420> now<00:00:44.110> yeah<00:00:45.110> so

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
happening in the heart right now yeah so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.290 
happening in the heart right now yeah so
there's<00:00:45.710> no<00:00:45.800> perfusion<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:46.519> why<00:00:46.730> though<00:00:46.970> is

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
there's no perfusion but why though is

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.250 
there's no perfusion but why though is
there<00:00:47.510> what's<00:00:47.930> blocking<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.559> oxygen<00:00:50.230> cool

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
there what's blocking the oxygen cool

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.380 
there what's blocking the oxygen cool
what's<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:51.680> cold<00:00:54.790> but<00:00:55.790> I<00:00:55.820> mean<00:00:55.970> like<00:00:56.120> what

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
what's that cold but I mean like what

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.520 
what's that cold but I mean like what
happens<00:00:56.659> it's<00:00:56.809> like<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.379> have

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
happens it's like that you have

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.060 
happens it's like that you have
something<00:00:57.799> floating<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:59.710> a<00:01:00.710> clock

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
something floating that just a clock

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.090 
something floating that just a clock
right<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:03.140> whether<00:01:03.320> there's<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.650> clot<00:01:03.860> in<00:01:03.979> the

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
right so whether there's a clot in the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.539 
right so whether there's a clot in the
legs

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
legs

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.160 
legs
DVT<00:01:05.350> clot<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.500> lungs<00:01:07.060> pee<00:01:08.060> clot<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
DVT clot in the lungs pee clot in the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.750 
DVT clot in the lungs pee clot in the
brain<00:01:10.030> those<00:01:11.030> kinds<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.390> causes<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.840> CVA<00:01:12.760> same

brain those kinds of causes of CVA same

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.679 
brain those kinds of causes of CVA same
thing<00:01:14.150> clot<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.869> heart

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.499

the<00:01:20.630> board<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:23.560> for<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:25.039> heart<00:01:25.579> attack<00:01:25.700> that

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the board so for a heart attack that

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.700 
the board so for a heart attack that
look<00:01:26.450> good<00:01:26.570> let's<00:01:26.840> take<00:01:27.020> Jesus<00:01:28.299> mi<00:01:32.500> we<00:01:33.500> have

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
look good let's take Jesus mi we have

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.809 
look good let's take Jesus mi we have
main<00:01:34.310> highways<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.360> heart<00:01:35.659> rate<00:01:36.819> also

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
main highways of the heart rate also

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:44.990 
main highways of the heart rate also
known<00:01:38.119> as<00:01:38.600> your<00:01:38.869> way

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.050 

the<00:01:46.000> freeways<00:01:46.360> that's<00:01:46.600> right

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the freeways that's right

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.950 
the freeways that's right
your<00:01:49.060> coronary<00:01:49.480> arteries<00:01:49.930> young<00:01:50.340> cool<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
your coronary arteries young cool so

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.460 
your coronary arteries young cool so
when<00:01:53.080> you're<00:01:53.200> making<00:01:53.260> your<00:01:53.440> note<00:01:53.680> cards

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
when you're making your note cards

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.290 
when you're making your note cards
you're<00:01:56.470> using<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.890> first<00:01:57.550> off<00:01:57.820> start<00:01:58.150> of<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
you're using that first off start of the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.370 
you're using that first off start of the
pathophysiology<00:01:59.400> secondly<00:02:00.400> you've<00:02:01.000> had<00:02:01.150> your

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
pathophysiology secondly you've had your

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.700 
pathophysiology secondly you've had your
data

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
data

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:12.060 
data
signs<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.220> symptoms<00:02:04.560> laboratory<00:02:05.560> balance<00:02:11.070> so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
signs and symptoms laboratory balance so

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.040 
signs and symptoms laboratory balance so
let's<00:02:12.250> go<00:02:12.400> up<00:02:12.520> with<00:02:12.910> what<00:02:13.180> happens<00:02:13.630> how<00:02:13.840> do<00:02:13.900> we

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
let's go up with what happens how do we

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.340 
let's go up with what happens how do we
get<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.610> big<00:02:15.910> highways<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.600> our<00:02:16.750> heart

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
get so on the big highways of our heart

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.120 
get so on the big highways of our heart
here<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.360> plaque<00:02:19.810> buildup<00:02:20.380> on<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.860> side

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
here we have plaque buildup on the side

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.540 
here we have plaque buildup on the side
okay<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:24.040> plaque<00:02:24.370> buildup<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.850> sides

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
okay this plaque buildup on the sides

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.870 
okay this plaque buildup on the sides
closes<00:02:27.550> lanes<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:29.470> our<00:02:29.620> heart<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.700> big

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
closes lanes in our heart on the big

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.580 
closes lanes in our heart on the big
highways<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.390> coronary<00:02:31.870> arteries<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
highways the coronary arteries so the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.170 
highways the coronary arteries so the
more<00:02:35.950> these<00:02:36.390> lane<00:02:37.390> closures<00:02:38.970> including<00:02:39.970> our

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
more these lane closures including our

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.590 
more these lane closures including our
lanes<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.470> narrower<00:02:41.920> our<00:02:42.250> street<00:02:42.580> becomes<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
lanes the narrower our street becomes so

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.970 
lanes the narrower our street becomes so
we<00:02:46.600> know<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> main<00:02:47.230> function<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.860> these

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
we know that the main function of these

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580 
we know that the main function of these
coronary<00:02:48.489> arteries<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.060> main<00:02:49.390> main<00:02:49.870> function

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
coronary arteries the main main function

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.630 
coronary arteries the main main function
is<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:51.370> put<00:02:52.030> oxygen<00:02:52.350> into<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.799> heart<00:02:53.980> that's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
is to put oxygen into the heart that's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.380 
is to put oxygen into the heart that's
all<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.650> what<00:02:56.980> happens<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.549> stop

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
all of this so what happens if you stop

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.990 
all of this so what happens if you stop
breathing<00:02:58.540> right<00:02:58.810> now<00:02:58.870> or<00:02:59.110> don't<00:02:59.290> have<00:02:59.380> oxygen

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.430 

maybe<00:03:02.600> dead<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:05.270> all<00:03:05.540> this<00:03:05.660> plaque<00:03:06.020> build<00:03:06.320> up

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
maybe dead so all this plaque build up

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.190 
maybe dead so all this plaque build up
from<00:03:07.240> they<00:03:08.240> call<00:03:08.420> risk<00:03:08.750> factors<00:03:10.180> cholesterol

and years of plaque buildup how do we

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.940 
and years of plaque buildup how do we
know<00:03:50.480> how<00:03:50.660> far<00:03:50.900> along<00:03:51.020> it<00:03:51.320> is<00:03:51.410> like<00:03:51.590> how<00:03:51.740> do<00:03:51.800> we

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
know how far along it is like how do we

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.040 
know how far along it is like how do we
classify<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.760> how<00:03:53.300> do<00:03:53.360> we<00:03:53.510> know<00:03:53.630> sometimes

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
classify that how do we know sometimes

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.390 
classify that how do we know sometimes
like<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> little<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.800> plaque<00:03:55.010> or<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.370> a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
like a little bit of plaque or like a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.310 
like a little bit of plaque or like a
lot<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.820> bit<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.030> pipe<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.810> there's<00:03:56.959> like<00:03:57.110> one

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
lot of bit of pipe and there's like one

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.310 
lot of bit of pipe and there's like one
leg<00:03:57.530> over<00:03:58.480> what<00:03:59.480> if<00:03:59.570> there's<00:03:59.720> two<00:03:59.930> legs<00:04:00.170> of

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
leg over what if there's two legs of

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.310 
leg over what if there's two legs of
them<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.010> different<00:04:01.340> than<00:04:01.430> one<00:04:01.640> leg<00:04:02.320> okay

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
them is that different than one leg okay

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.690 
them is that different than one leg okay
there's<00:04:03.590> three<00:04:03.709> legs<00:04:03.950> open<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.400> Hardwick

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
there's three legs open in the Hardwick

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.850 
there's three legs open in the Hardwick
a<00:04:04.940> lot<00:04:05.630> better<00:04:05.870> than<00:04:06.080> just<00:04:06.260> having<00:04:06.410> one<00:04:06.530> right

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
a lot better than just having one right

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.880 
a lot better than just having one right
now<00:04:07.030> so

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
now so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.280 
now so
the<00:04:10.820> medical<00:04:11.150> field<00:04:11.180> classifies<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.110> like

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the medical field classifies it like

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.289 
the medical field classifies it like
this

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:28.440 

they<00:04:19.299> classify<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:19.930> as<00:04:23.850> CAT<00:04:25.680> stage<00:04:26.680> one

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
they classify it as CAT stage one

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:40.840 
they classify it as CAT stage one
Stage<00:04:29.020> two<00:04:29.050> is<00:04:29.440> acute<00:04:30.010> coronary<00:04:30.750> syndrome

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.150 

so<00:04:41.540> pretty<00:04:41.720> much<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.140> same<00:04:42.410> highway<00:04:45.160> what

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
so pretty much the same highway what

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:54.640 
so pretty much the same highway what
we're<00:04:46.310> saying<00:04:46.490> here<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:49.330> lot<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.360> black

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
okay so uh unstable angina what the heck

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:33.730 
okay so uh unstable angina what the heck
is<00:05:19.979> unstable<00:05:20.430> angina<00:05:29.000> oh<00:05:30.000> my<00:05:30.389> god<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:31.740> guys

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
is unstable angina oh my god you guys

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.600 
is unstable angina oh my god you guys
okay<00:05:34.740> so<00:05:34.770> when<00:05:35.069> you<00:05:35.159> work<00:05:35.370> out<00:05:35.550> okay<00:05:36.379> right

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
okay so when you work out okay right

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:46.580 
okay so when you work out okay right
when<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:38.729> work<00:05:38.909> out<00:05:39.229> you<00:05:40.229> get<00:05:40.500> chest<00:05:41.430> pain<00:05:41.690> why

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.530 

using<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.490> oxygen<00:05:47.639> but<00:05:48.030> what<00:05:48.120> happens<00:05:48.389> to

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
using the oxygen but what happens to

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.770 
using the oxygen but what happens to
your<00:05:48.710> heart<00:05:49.710> muscles<00:05:50.700> when<00:05:50.940> you<00:05:51.120> work<00:05:51.419> out<00:05:51.600> or

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
your heart muscles when you work out or

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.170 
your heart muscles when you work out or
what<00:05:51.870> happens<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.430> your<00:05:53.430> arteries<00:05:53.940> when<00:05:54.120> you

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
what happens to your arteries when you

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.330 
what happens to your arteries when you
working<00:05:54.480> on<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:54.990> constrict<00:05:55.470> so<00:05:56.010> what<00:05:56.130> happens

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
working on it constrict so what happens

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.550 
working on it constrict so what happens
all<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.580> plaque<00:05:58.820> there<00:05:59.820> causing<00:06:00.120> more<00:06:00.750> lanes

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
all is plaque there causing more lanes

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.030 
all is plaque there causing more lanes
to<00:06:01.830> be<00:06:01.950> closed<00:06:02.280> on<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.639> highway<00:06:02.940> so

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.450 

interesting<00:06:08.040> huh

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
interesting huh

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.760 
interesting huh
so<00:06:09.450> how<00:06:09.630> do<00:06:09.690> we<00:06:09.810> know<00:06:09.960> how<00:06:10.110> far<00:06:10.440> along<00:06:10.669> this<00:06:11.669> is

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
so how do we know how far along this is

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.430 
so how do we know how far along this is
so<00:06:13.770> what<00:06:14.220> we<00:06:14.340> do<00:06:14.550> is<00:06:14.820> we<00:06:15.470> when<00:06:16.470> we<00:06:16.680> relax<00:06:18.440> it's

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
so what we do is we when we relax it's

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.800 
so what we do is we when we relax it's
supposed<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.770> beso<00:06:20.040> dilating<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.810> what

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
supposed to beso dilating and what

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.300 
supposed to beso dilating and what
happens<00:06:22.080> if<00:06:22.169> we're<00:06:22.320> just<00:06:22.470> relaxed<00:06:23.070> or<00:06:23.160> rainy

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
happens if we're just relaxed or rainy

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.390 
happens if we're just relaxed or rainy
or<00:06:23.400> on<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.669> recliner<00:06:24.030> chair<00:06:24.389> and<00:06:25.010> now<00:06:26.010> we<00:06:26.070> have

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
or on the recliner chair and now we have

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.350 
or on the recliner chair and now we have
angina<00:06:28.430> we<00:06:29.430> haven't<00:06:29.639> done<00:06:29.700> anything<00:06:29.970> to<00:06:30.120> cause

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
angina we haven't done anything to cause

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.300 
angina we haven't done anything to cause
restriction<00:06:30.930> constriction<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:31.950> just<00:06:32.130> we're

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
restriction constriction it just we're

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.370 
restriction constriction it just we're
just<00:06:32.340> sitting<00:06:32.729> there<00:06:32.930> at<00:06:33.930> rest

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
just sitting there at rest

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.000 
just sitting there at rest
yeah<00:06:34.979> in<00:06:35.220> arrest<00:06:35.460> that's<00:06:35.790> unstable<00:06:36.510> angina

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
yeah in arrest that's unstable angina

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.010 
yeah in arrest that's unstable angina
stable<00:06:38.010> means<00:06:38.220> they<00:06:38.370> were<00:06:38.430> exercising<00:06:39.030> once

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
stable means they were exercising once

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.719 
stable means they were exercising once
we<00:06:40.139> stopped<00:06:40.350> exercising<00:06:40.620> and<00:06:41.130> vasodilator

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
we stopped exercising and vasodilator
