with<00:00:57.679> the<00:00:57.769> coming<00:00:58.070> undone<00:00:58.449> by<00:00:59.449> itself<00:00:59.750> the

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
with the coming undone by itself the

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.110 
with the coming undone by itself the
band<00:01:00.199> does<00:01:00.410> absolutely<00:01:01.100> nothing<00:01:01.489> but<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:01.969> is

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.110 
another five days so I was very
pleasantly<00:04:43.740> surprised<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.640> it<00:04:44.729> lived<00:04:44.940> up<00:04:45.060> to

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
pleasantly surprised that it lived up to

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.029 
pleasantly surprised that it lived up to
its<00:04:45.330> claim<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:46.440> think<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:46.830> quite

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
its claim and I think it's quite

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:47.869 
its claim and I think it's quite
impressive

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
impressive

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.359 
impressive
can<00:04:48.089> actually<00:04:48.240> last<00:04:48.659> that<00:04:49.050> long<00:04:49.709> you<00:04:50.219> can

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:50.369 
can actually last that long you can

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.219 
can actually last that long you can
purchase<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.819> sony<00:04:51.119> smartband<00:04:51.599> now<00:04:51.959> it

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
purchase the sony smartband now it

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.350 
purchase the sony smartband now it
retails<00:04:52.740> for<00:04:52.889> $100<00:04:53.849> but<00:04:54.029> you<00:04:54.119> can<00:04:54.209> already

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
retails for $100 but you can already

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.730 
retails for $100 but you can already
find<00:04:54.599> it<00:04:54.779> for<00:04:54.929> cheaper<00:04:55.289> through<00:04:55.559> websites

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
find it for cheaper through websites

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.949 
find it for cheaper through websites
like<00:04:56.189> Amazon<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:56.999> I<00:04:57.509> think<00:04:57.719> it's<00:04:57.809> pretty

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:57.959 
like Amazon and I think it's pretty

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.719 
like Amazon and I think it's pretty
fairly<00:04:58.289> priced<00:04:58.679> putting<00:04:59.039> it<00:04:59.129> directly<00:04:59.309> in

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
fairly priced putting it directly in

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.850 
fairly priced putting it directly in
line<00:04:59.759> with<00:05:00.059> other<00:05:00.869> competitors<00:05:01.319> like<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
line with other competitors like the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.219 
line with other competitors like the
Fitbit<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.759> it's<00:05:03.360> certainly<00:05:03.659> cheaper<00:05:03.899> than

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
Fitbit and it's certainly cheaper than

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.679 
Fitbit and it's certainly cheaper than
something<00:05:04.499> like<00:05:04.649> the<00:05:04.800> Nike<00:05:05.219> FuelBand<00:05:05.789> the

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
something like the Nike FuelBand the

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.749 
something like the Nike FuelBand the
sony<00:05:06.929> smartband<00:05:07.259> isn't<00:05:07.770> perfect<00:05:08.159> I<00:05:08.279> do<00:05:08.339> think

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
sony smartband isn't perfect I do think

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.699 
sony smartband isn't perfect I do think
there's<00:05:08.939> room<00:05:09.240> for<00:05:09.300> improvement<00:05:09.619> but<00:05:10.619> if

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:10.709 
there's room for improvement but if

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.109 
there's room for improvement but if
