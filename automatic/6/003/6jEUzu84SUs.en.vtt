00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.799
 baby because I am and that is the first 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.120
 part of minecraft beautiful tree and 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.120
 Now it starts 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.680
 Here are the most important ones 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.039
 stuff you need minecraft 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.810
 bed to skip the night then 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.019
 a box around the community and fallen 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 to keep 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.080
 of course his heart and melt 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 manufacture glass and a workbench and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.399
 this whole shit we catch everything 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 right away 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.440
 I'll show you how to get the bed today 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.149
 rest and stop the stove 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 not a bit nicer from the last one 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.100
 sitting here so much space later 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 is so directly with the oven 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.289
 that's such a beautiful call very big 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.890
 no place has nothing with or 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.890
 hood 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 Yes 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.880
 then we pull the rear wall high 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.880
 that the 22nd 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.840
 then we take the tracks one front 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
 to the back wall the other two 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.800
 lateral the other stairs by 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.950
 then beautiful corners arise and that they 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.670
 there we can do the printing plates 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.960
 Do not cook in the oven because I'm open 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.450
 but they have to be a stone behind it 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 then they land on the top 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.950
 The stone does not matter if you like it or not 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.010
 so does that meets not sure even the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.140
 trap door and therefore first for 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.480
 make the future and the oven 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.550
 push 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.550
 The workshop should not be off 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.770
 the next one is this bank wavering 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.420
 to store 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.660
 These are now two variants with once 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.250
 a stock and to lighting her 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.570
 can you look like a stock or 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.930
 Do not continue lighting 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:43.020
 show hints difference and the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:52.420
 We need things and two goals 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:57.430
 two stairs and optionally the two 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:02.500
 torches or yes I have a lot of oak 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.200
 Take a cupboard 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.720
 and then move 22 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.330
 Besides 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.330
 the wall has 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.950
 first so that the run is in the middle 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.820
 The educator will either take this half 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.920
 plates and then a storage compartment 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.160
 that does not help, it just looks nice 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.840
 out or we do because torches burnt 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.920
 he is lit or the torches 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.709
 we can also stop by the side what 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.000
 You should not stop talking about that 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.260
 would give a belfry because then 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.610
 public the box no longer so 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.610
 half or torches 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.460
 and now do this 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.440
 I do 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.560
 for that we need 20 later two 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.540
 oblique number two beds two white 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:31.600
 wool and 16 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:34.580
 and also signs and 8000 the 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:46.300
 two in two apart between 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:46.300
 then come she wil want the pieces 2 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.320
 Now we take the signs and the 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.960
 side to it 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.740
 which is like this as you a 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.810
 network edge 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.740
 he looks pretty good and destroys 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.330
 No smoke and do the whole thing 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.890
 in front and at the others all others 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.670
 Side is on there is a bit 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.670
 moment 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:21.800
 two on each of the four corners old 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.800
 the two bookshelves and the two 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.080
 namely have only red wine to this lag 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.660
 suits then I see you something 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.340
 about that 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.380
 that actually already finished 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:06:03.270
 you can decorate it with the fall 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:06:07.130
 that such a pattern would be made 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.130
 It makes sense to build a wall 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:26.260
 Best fallen on the wall
