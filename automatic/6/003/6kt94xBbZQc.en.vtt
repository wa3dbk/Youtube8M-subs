00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.169 
35 hair with my incredibly messy desk
this<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.930> my<00:00:07.080> HP<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.820> nitro<00:00:08.820> rs4<00:00:10.550> hmm<00:00:11.610> I'm<00:00:11.700> doing

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this is my HP I nitro rs4 hmm I'm doing

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.180 
this is my HP I nitro rs4 hmm I'm doing
some<00:00:12.360> maintenance<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.710> hasn't<00:00:13.889> run

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
some maintenance on it and hasn't run

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.019 
some maintenance on it and hasn't run
right<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.790> ever<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.340> something<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
right for ever I think it's something to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.500 
right for ever I think it's something to
do<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.390> carburetor<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:20.330> yeah<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> think

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
do with the carburetor but yeah I think

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.480 
do with the carburetor but yeah I think
I<00:00:21.779> need<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> slide<00:00:22.350> card<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.980> something<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I need a slide card or something on it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.990 
I need a slide card or something on it
but<00:00:24.090> anyways<00:00:24.480> I've<00:00:25.289> had<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> few<00:00:25.830> people<00:00:26.039> ask<00:00:26.400> me

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
but anyways I've had a few people ask me

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
but anyways I've had a few people ask me
how<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> gas<00:00:27.660> cars<00:00:28.080> move<00:00:29.010> without<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:30.800> quote

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
how the gas cars move without a quote

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.569 
how the gas cars move without a quote
unquote<00:00:31.949> clutch<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.980> motor<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.399> running

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
unquote clutch and the motor is running

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.139 
unquote clutch and the motor is running
and<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.239> don't<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> torque<00:00:36.809> converter

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
and they don't have a torque converter

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.110 
and they don't have a torque converter
so<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> am<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.440> explain<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
so I am here to explain this is the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
so I am here to explain this is the
motor<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.430> HP<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.670> nitro<00:00:45.239> rs4<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
motor from my HP I nitro rs4 it's one of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.709 
motor from my HP I nitro rs4 it's one of
the<00:00:47.100> first<00:00:47.340> generation<00:00:47.940> ones<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> don't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the first generation ones so I don't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.040 
the first generation ones so I don't
really<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> point<00:00:49.890> 16<00:00:51.050> I'm

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
really know I think it's a point 16 I'm

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
really know I think it's a point 16 I'm
not<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.170> whole<00:00:57.739> yeah<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
not really up on the the whole yeah the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
not really up on the the whole yeah the
whole<00:00:59.760> lingo<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> guess<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.870> could<00:01:01.079> call<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
whole lingo I guess you could call it of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.570 
whole lingo I guess you could call it of
the<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.120> gas<00:01:03.359> powered<00:01:03.840> RC<00:01:04.290> cars<00:01:04.890> I've

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
Duratrax axis when I was like 14 or 15

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
Duratrax axis when I was like 14 or 15
and<00:01:20.509> I<00:01:21.509> promptly<00:01:21.990> dispatched<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this is the carburetor it normally sits

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
this is the carburetor it normally sits
right<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:48.740> only<00:01:49.740> slightly<00:01:50.490> less<00:01:50.899> up

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
right there only slightly less up

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.789 
right there only slightly less up
because<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.950> haven't<00:01:53.310> removed<00:01:54.530> take<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> off

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.660 
because I haven't removed take it off
again<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.969> anyways<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:58.680> engine<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
again but anyways this engine is a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.709 
again but anyways this engine is a
two-stroke<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.540> our<00:02:01.259> most<00:02:02.689> most<00:02:04.040> gas<00:02:05.040> RC<00:02:05.430> cars

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
two-stroke as our most most gas RC cars

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.529 
two-stroke as our most most gas RC cars
it's<00:02:06.979> got<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.489> major<00:02:08.640> components<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
it's got all the major components that a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.290 
it's got all the major components that a
normal<00:02:10.110> engine<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.940> turn

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
normal engine in turn

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.240 
normal engine in turn
combustion<00:02:12.720> engine<00:02:12.990> has<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.440> has<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
combustion engine has and has the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460 
combustion engine has and has the
cylinder<00:02:14.940> head<00:02:15.150> which<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.170> where<00:02:16.350> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
cylinder head which is where it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.880 
cylinder head which is where it
compresses<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.150> air<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.540> fuel<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.710> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
compresses all the air in fuel this is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.880 
compresses all the air in fuel this is
actually<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.460> exhaust<00:02:20.820> right<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
actually the exhaust right here this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 
actually the exhaust right here this
right<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.610> exhaust<00:02:23.880> pipe<00:02:24.150> comes<00:02:25.050> out

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
right here is the exhaust pipe comes out

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.670 
right here is the exhaust pipe comes out
like<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.210> attaches<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.500> comes

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
like that attaches on there and it comes

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.070 
like that attaches on there and it comes
out<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.010> blows<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.700> there<00:02:32.690> down<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.750> here

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
out and blows it out there down in here

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 
out and blows it out there down in here
I<00:02:34.140> can't<00:02:34.740> really<00:02:34.920> take<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.340> apart<00:02:35.580> because<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I can't really take it apart because a

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
I can't really take it apart because a
couple<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> screws<00:02:36.750> are<00:02:36.900> stripped<00:02:37.310> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
couple of the screws are stripped and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.690 
couple of the screws are stripped and
all<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.150> crap<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.100> down<00:02:41.100> here<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.460> course

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
all that crap but down here of course

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.160 
all that crap but down here of course
it's<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.120> crankshaft<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> piston<00:02:43.140> goes

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
it's got the crankshaft the piston goes

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.900 
it's got the crankshaft the piston goes
up<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.590> down<00:02:43.620> inside<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.760> it's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
up and down inside like that and it's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.520 
up and down inside like that and it's
got<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> crankshaft<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.750> spins<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.290> that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
got the crankshaft that spins like that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.790 
got the crankshaft that spins like that
which<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.520> turn<00:02:47.700> connected<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:49.440> thing

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
which is in turn connected to this thing

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.350 
which is in turn connected to this thing
right<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.070> which<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.670> flywheel<00:02:51.150> which

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
right here which is the flywheel which

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.570 
right here which is the flywheel which
balances<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.260> harmonizes<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.190> whatever<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
balances and harmonizes or whatever the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.730 
balances and harmonizes or whatever the
hell<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.820> want<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.090> say<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.960> motor<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.440> keeps

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
hell you want to say the motor and keeps

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.580 
hell you want to say the motor and keeps
it<00:02:55.890> from<00:02:55.920> vibrating<00:02:56.400> too<00:02:56.970> much<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.320> this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it from vibrating too much and then this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.860 
it from vibrating too much and then this
is<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.130> clutch<00:02:59.370> right<00:02:59.760> here<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
is the clutch right here it's a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.390 
is the clutch right here it's a
centrifugal<00:03:01.440> clutch<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.710> got<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
centrifugal clutch you it's got the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.820 
centrifugal clutch you it's got the
flywheel<00:03:05.850> has<00:03:06.090> these<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:09.200> rods<00:03:10.200> sticking

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
flywheel has these little rods sticking

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.780 
flywheel has these little rods sticking
out<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.600> when<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.170> turns<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:14.280> creates<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
out of it and when it turns it creates a

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.300 
out of it and when it turns it creates a
pivot<00:03:15.150> point<00:03:15.420> as<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:16.470> don't<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.160> can

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
pivot point as you don't know if you can

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.180 
pivot point as you don't know if you can
see<00:03:17.610> but<00:03:17.850> there's<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.090> little<00:03:18.380> split<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.680> and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
see but there's a little split there and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.090 
see but there's a little split there and
it's<00:03:20.520> held<00:03:20.730> together<00:03:20.850> by<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.240> spring<00:03:21.630> and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
it's held together by a spring and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.710 
it's held together by a spring and
there's<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.160> little<00:03:23.400> split<00:03:23.790> right<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
there's a little split right there the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.010 
there's a little split right there the
stupid<00:03:25.200> iPod<00:03:25.500> doesn't<00:03:25.860> focus<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:27.090> um<00:03:27.270> it's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
stupid iPod doesn't focus but um it's

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.130 
stupid iPod doesn't focus but um it's
held<00:03:28.650> together<00:03:28.800> by<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:30.000> spring<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:30.840> what

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
held together by a spring so what

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.730 
held together by a spring so what
happens<00:03:31.560> as<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.490> put<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.900> motor<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.440> pull

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
happens as you put it the motor you pull

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.860 
happens as you put it the motor you pull
the<00:03:34.890> motor<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.790> spins<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.360> way<00:03:36.600> I'm

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the motor and it spins that way I'm

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.860 
the motor and it spins that way I'm
doing<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.100> pull<00:03:38.280> start<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.330> spins<00:03:39.630> that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
doing the pull start and it spins that

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.710 
doing the pull start and it spins that
way<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.170> what<00:03:40.500> happens<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.490> that<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.390> motor<00:03:42.630> is

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
way so what happens is that the motor is

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.440 
way so what happens is that the motor is
spinning<00:03:42.950> if<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.130> can<00:03:44.280> get<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.850> motor<00:03:45.030> spinning

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
spinning if I can get the motor spinning

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.720 
spinning if I can get the motor spinning
this<00:03:45.690> way<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.070> put<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.610> on<00:03:49.220> right<00:03:50.220> here

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
this way and if I put this on right here

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.410 
this way and if I put this on right here
I'm<00:03:51.320> just<00:03:52.320> mocking<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.130> up<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.880> what<00:03:54.060> happens

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I'm just mocking it up but what happens

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.020 
I'm just mocking it up but what happens
is<00:03:54.630> when<00:03:54.990> it's<00:03:55.170> on<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:56.610> pegs

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
is when it's on one of the little pegs

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.270 
is when it's on one of the little pegs
the<00:03:57.780> centrifugal<00:03:58.230> force<00:03:58.290> from<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> motor

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the centrifugal force from the motor

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.710 
the centrifugal force from the motor
spinning<00:03:59.730> makes<00:04:00.660> these<00:04:01.580> splay<00:04:02.580> out<00:04:02.880> like<00:04:03.390> this

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
spinning makes these splay out like this

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.230 
spinning makes these splay out like this
and<00:04:04.020> then<00:04:04.740> when<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.310> motor<00:04:05.490> revs<00:04:05.790> down<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
and then when the motor revs down the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.820 
and then when the motor revs down the
spring<00:04:06.540> brings<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.930> back<00:04:07.080> off<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.590> clutch

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
spring brings it back off the clutch

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.500 
spring brings it back off the clutch
belt<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.310> will<00:04:08.580> get<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.850> cook<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.300> clutch

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
belt and will get to cook the clutch

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.880 
belt and will get to cook the clutch
belt<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.500> minute

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
belt in a minute

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.770 
belt in a minute
but<00:04:11.370> what<00:04:11.520> happens<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.030> when<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.330> RPMs

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
but what happens is when the RPMs

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.930 
but what happens is when the RPMs
increase<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:14.040> gets<00:04:14.310> heavier<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> heavier

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
increase it gets heavier and heavier

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.720 
increase it gets heavier and heavier
because<00:04:15.330> it's<00:04:15.660> centrifugal<00:04:16.260> force<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.430> course

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
because it's centrifugal force of course

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.550 
because it's centrifugal force of course
I<00:04:17.880> can't<00:04:18.150> say<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.510> friggin<00:04:18.840> word<00:04:19.020> it's<00:04:19.260> one

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
I can't say the friggin word it's one

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.159 
I can't say the friggin word it's one
o'clock<00:04:19.859> at<00:04:20.220> night<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.850> can't<00:04:21.660> even<00:04:21.750> say<00:04:21.989> one

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
o'clock at night I can't even say one

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.930 
o'clock at night I can't even say one
o'clock<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.680> paid

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
o'clock it paid

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.310 
o'clock it paid
sorry<00:04:24.940> I'm<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> bit<00:04:25.330> tired<00:04:27.270> but<00:04:28.270> yeah<00:04:29.020> there's<00:04:29.260> a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.170 
sorry I'm a bit tired but yeah there's a
little<00:04:29.500> bit<00:04:29.650> better<00:04:29.980> of<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.580> split<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:30.910> you

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
little bit better of the split that you

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.480 
little bit better of the split that you
can<00:04:31.330> see<00:04:31.510> but<00:04:32.110> since<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.590> pivot<00:04:32.950> point<00:04:33.190> since

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
can see but since the pivot point since

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.460 
can see but since the pivot point since
there's<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.790> rod<00:04:34.480> going<00:04:34.810> through<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.440> right

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
there's a rod going through it right

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.660 
there's a rod going through it right
there<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.220> right<00:04:37.030> there<00:04:37.770> when<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.800> spins<00:04:39.280> that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
there and right there when it spins that

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.880 
there and right there when it spins that
way<00:04:39.910> it's<00:04:40.390> gonna<00:04:40.570> come<00:04:41.080> apart<00:04:41.380> there<00:04:41.470> and

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
way it's gonna come apart there and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.490 
way it's gonna come apart there and
there<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.700> it's<00:04:42.880> gonna<00:04:43.000> go<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.510> open<00:04:43.900> up<00:04:44.260> like

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
there and it's gonna go and open up like

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.460 
there and it's gonna go and open up like
this<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:46.000> know<00:04:46.150> kind<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.660> like<00:04:47.050> one<00:04:47.260> of<00:04:47.290> them

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
this you know kind of like one of them

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.220 
this you know kind of like one of them
things<00:04:47.800> like<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.220> crab<00:04:48.670> claw<00:04:49.270> whatever<00:04:49.930> crab

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
things like a crab claw whatever crab

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.660 
things like a crab claw whatever crab
people<00:04:50.410> but<00:04:51.310> what<00:04:51.550> happens<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.980> this<00:04:53.980> is<00:04:54.040> the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
people but what happens is this is the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.580 
people but what happens is this is the
clutch<00:04:54.910> belt<00:04:55.180> it's<00:04:55.750> got<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.050> teeth<00:04:56.230> that

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
clutch belt it's got the teeth that

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.040 
clutch belt it's got the teeth that
drive<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.760> main<00:04:59.880> gear<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.090> that's<00:05:01.900> the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
drive the main gear and that's the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.180 
drive the main gear and that's the
inside<00:05:02.410> of<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.680> clutch<00:05:02.920> belt<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:04.510> fits

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
inside of the clutch belt that fits

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.130 
inside of the clutch belt that fits
that's<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.370> wrong<00:05:06.550> way<00:05:06.700> but<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:07.150> fits<00:05:07.450> nice

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
that's the wrong way but that fits nice

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.140 
that's the wrong way but that fits nice
and<00:05:08.170> snug<00:05:08.410> inside<00:05:08.860> there<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.580> can<00:05:09.940> picture

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
and snug inside there so you can picture

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.860 
and snug inside there so you can picture
this<00:05:10.420> spinning<00:05:11.280> like<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:12.670> you<00:05:13.360> know<00:05:13.390> you<00:05:13.720> can

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
this spinning like so you know you can

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.330 
this spinning like so you know you can
picture<00:05:14.050> this<00:05:14.260> spinning<00:05:14.650> with<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.920> motor<00:05:15.130> and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
picture this spinning with the motor and

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.310 
picture this spinning with the motor and
that<00:05:16.090> well<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.420> clutch<00:05:16.690> would<00:05:16.930> be<00:05:17.080> spinning

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
that well the clutch would be spinning

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.900 
that well the clutch would be spinning
with<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.680> motor<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:17.980> then<00:05:18.250> when<00:05:18.460> it's<00:05:18.610> plays

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
with the motor and then when it's plays

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.520 
with the motor and then when it's plays
out<00:05:19.120> enough<00:05:19.420> it's<00:05:19.570> going<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.810> make<00:05:19.960> contact

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
out enough it's going to make contact

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.380 
out enough it's going to make contact
with<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.800> inside<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:22.660> clutch<00:05:22.870> valve<00:05:24.390> you

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
with the inside of the clutch valve you

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.480 
with the inside of the clutch valve you
can<00:05:25.420> actually<00:05:25.900> see<00:05:26.110> it<00:05:26.200> worn<00:05:26.440> away<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:27.310> the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
can actually see it worn away in the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.120 
can actually see it worn away in the
middle<00:05:27.820> where<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.120> spring<00:05:28.450> is<00:05:28.890> but<00:05:29.890> it's

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
middle where the spring is but it's

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.770 
middle where the spring is but it's
gonna<00:05:30.280> make<00:05:30.520> contact<00:05:30.700> with<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.300> inside<00:05:31.660> of

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
gonna make contact with the inside of

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.200 
gonna make contact with the inside of
the<00:05:31.870> clutch<00:05:32.080> belt<00:05:32.410> and<00:05:32.880> it's<00:05:33.880> going<00:05:34.090> to

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
the clutch belt and it's going to

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.030 
the clutch belt and it's going to
because<00:05:34.690> it's<00:05:34.840> made<00:05:35.020> of<00:05:35.170> like<00:05:35.350> a<00:05:35.380> you<00:05:36.010> know

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
because it's made of like a you know

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.140 
because it's made of like a you know
friction<00:05:36.580> material<00:05:38.130> like<00:05:39.130> a<00:05:39.160> normal<00:05:39.580> clutch

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
friction material like a normal clutch

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.200 
friction material like a normal clutch
and<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.420> normal<00:05:40.660> stick<00:05:41.290> shift<00:05:41.530> car<00:05:41.590> is<00:05:42.210> it's

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
and a normal stick shift car is it's

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.880 
and a normal stick shift car is it's
gonna<00:05:43.390> make<00:05:43.630> contact<00:05:43.810> with<00:05:44.170> the<00:05:44.290> outside<00:05:44.620> and

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
gonna make contact with the outside and

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.160 
gonna make contact with the outside and
spin<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.780> so<00:05:46.780> that's<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:48.150> five<00:05:49.150> six<00:05:49.720> minute<00:05:49.990> long

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
spin it so that's a five six minute long

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.230 
spin it so that's a five six minute long
