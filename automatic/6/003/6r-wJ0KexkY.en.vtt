just go and right click on it and just

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.180 
just go and right click on it and just
go<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.850> MP<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.480> little<00:03:25.780> area<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.320> his

go out and I MP that little area and his
cruise<00:03:27.610> missile<00:03:28.000> will<00:03:28.180> explode<00:03:28.209> in<00:03:28.810> midair<00:03:29.050> so

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
cruise missile will explode in midair so

maps<00:03:54.040> i<00:03:54.250> think<00:03:54.519> it's<00:03:54.670> about<00:03:54.850> three<00:03:55.090> or<00:03:55.120> four

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
maps i think it's about three or four

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.210 
maps i think it's about three or four
maps<00:03:55.780> i've<00:03:56.050> noticed<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:56.709> far<00:03:56.739> i<00:03:56.950> haven't

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
maps i've noticed so far i haven't

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.490 
maps i've noticed so far i haven't
played<00:03:57.430> all<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.670> them<00:03:57.790> just<00:03:58.060> yet<00:03:58.350> but<00:03:59.350> i<00:03:59.410> know

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
played all of them just yet but i know

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.680 
played all of them just yet but i know
some<00:03:59.830> of<00:03:59.860> them<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.820> gunship<00:04:01.330> so<00:04:01.600> you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
some of them you have the gunship so you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.509 
some of them you have the gunship so you
don't<00:04:02.050> have<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.230> strike<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.739> can<00:04:02.800> see<00:04:02.950> he's<00:04:03.280> put

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
don't have a strike you can see he's put

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.790 
don't have a strike you can see he's put
a<00:04:03.550> strike<00:04:03.880> right<00:04:04.150> there<00:04:04.180> i<00:04:04.660> know<00:04:05.440> he's<00:04:05.590> not

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
a strike right there i know he's not

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.290 
a strike right there i know he's not
going<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:06.010> get<00:04:06.190> anybody<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:06.910> see<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
going to get anybody you can see on the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.580 
going to get anybody you can see on the
top<00:04:07.480> right<00:04:07.660> corner<00:04:07.870> there's<00:04:08.260> no

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
top right corner there's no

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.720 
top right corner there's no
actually<00:04:08.800> going<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.010> get<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.160> kill<00:04:09.430> with<00:04:09.580> it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
actually going to get a kill with it

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.160 
actually going to get a kill with it
that's<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.060> reason<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.480> didn't<00:04:10.750> want<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.989> block

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
that's the reason I didn't want to block

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.619 
that's the reason I didn't want to block
it<00:04:11.290> off<00:04:11.440> because<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.640> knew<00:04:12.879> everybody's<00:04:13.450> going

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
it off because I knew everybody's going

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.240 
it off because I knew everybody's going
to<00:04:13.660> move<00:04:13.810> from<00:04:13.989> there<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.349> you<00:04:14.470> can<00:04:14.739> see<00:04:15.040> what

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
to move from there so you can see what

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.250 
to move from there so you can see what
it's<00:04:15.400> going<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.610> put<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> strike<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.079> all

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
it's going to put a strike so it is all

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.140 
it's going to put a strike so it is all
after<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.160> decide<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:18.729> that's<00:04:18.880> gonna

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
after you to decide if that's gonna

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.879 
after you to decide if that's gonna
actually<00:04:19.359> be<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.720> problem<00:04:20.079> for<00:04:20.260> your<00:04:20.410> team<00:04:20.650> or

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
actually be a problem for your team or

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.920 
actually be a problem for your team or
is<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.100> not<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.639> be<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> problem<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.690> can

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
is it not going to be a problem you can

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.810 
is it not going to be a problem you can
block<00:04:23.229> it<00:04:23.260> off<00:04:23.500> like<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.710> said<00:04:24.010> with<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.220> EMP

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
block it off like I said with the EMP

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.210 
block it off like I said with the EMP
and<00:04:25.090> that's<00:04:25.630> about<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.139> only<00:04:26.320> thing<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:27.040> can

remember about the cruise missile is
they<00:04:39.250> charge<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.790> very<00:04:40.030> very<00:04:40.240> slowly<00:04:40.510> you<00:04:40.810> need

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
they charge is very very slowly you need

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.080 
they charge is very very slowly you need
to<00:04:41.169> have<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.500> sea<00:04:41.680> flag<00:04:41.950> in<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.250> case<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.669> it

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
to have the sea flag in this case and it

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.140 
to have the sea flag in this case and it
also<00:04:43.360> detonates<00:04:44.139> very<00:04:44.470> slowly<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:45.820> need<00:04:46.000> to

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
also detonates very slowly you need to

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.580 
also detonates very slowly you need to
plan<00:04:46.360> ahead<00:04:46.479> where<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.110> want<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.380> put<00:04:47.530> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
plan ahead where you want to put the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.469 
plan ahead where you want to put the
strike<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.310> need<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.639> make<00:04:48.669> sure<00:04:48.910> that

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
strike and you need to make sure that

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.850 
strike and you need to make sure that
you're<00:04:49.630> trying<00:04:49.840> actually<00:04:50.290> does<00:04:50.500> some<00:04:50.710> damage

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
you're trying actually does some damage

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.260 
you're trying actually does some damage
because<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.430> don't<00:04:51.639> want<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:51.850> waste<00:04:52.000> them

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
because you don't want to waste them

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.730 
because you don't want to waste them
since<00:04:52.510> they<00:04:52.690> take<00:04:52.870> so<00:04:53.080> much<00:04:53.229> time<00:04:53.440> for<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.710> to

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
since they take so much time for it to

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.950 
since they take so much time for it to
charge<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.790> actually<00:04:55.180> use<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:55.600> want<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.870> be

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
charge and actually use you want to be

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.350 
charge and actually use you want to be
using<00:04:56.320> them<00:04:56.440> carefully<00:04:56.919> now<00:04:57.430> most<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
using them carefully now most of the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.879 
using them carefully now most of the
times<00:04:58.570> you'll<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:58.960> somebody<00:04:59.200> sitting<00:04:59.590> back

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
times you'll see somebody sitting back

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.650 
times you'll see somebody sitting back
with<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.190> gun<00:05:00.669> or<00:05:00.940> maybe<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.270> see<00:05:01.419> somebody

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
with the a gun or maybe you see somebody

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.170 
with the a gun or maybe you see somebody
in<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:01.990> mobile<00:05:02.139> tillery<00:05:02.910> those<00:05:03.910> are<00:05:04.120> the

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
in the mobile tillery those are the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.610 
in the mobile tillery those are the
targets<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.870> need<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.200> take<00:05:05.350> out

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
targets that you need to take out

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.719 
targets that you need to take out
obviously<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.160> can<00:05:06.310> make<00:05:06.460> them<00:05:06.639> a

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
obviously you can make them a

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.730 
obviously you can make them a
high-priority<00:05:07.240> threat<00:05:07.780> by<00:05:08.020> right-clicking

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
high-priority threat by right-clicking

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.560 
high-priority threat by right-clicking
and<00:05:09.010> go<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.370> choosing<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.030> option<00:05:10.419> and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
and go and choosing that option and

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.230 
and go and choosing that option and
giving<00:05:11.199> your<00:05:11.620> teammates<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.460> order<00:05:12.789> to<00:05:12.970> take

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
giving your teammates the order to take

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.700 
giving your teammates the order to take
him<00:05:13.389> out<00:05:13.510> because<00:05:13.750> it's<00:05:14.050> causing<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.500> problem

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
him out because it's causing a problem

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.650 
him out because it's causing a problem
for<00:05:14.950> your<00:05:15.010> team<00:05:15.220> or<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:16.030> can<00:05:16.180> do<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:16.539> yourself

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
for your team or you can do so yourself

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.070 
for your team or you can do so yourself
I<00:05:17.139> think<00:05:17.820> personally<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.090> found<00:05:19.600> that<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:20.050> be

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
I think personally I found that to be

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.440 
I think personally I found that to be
very<00:05:20.620> very<00:05:21.130> tricky<00:05:21.550> because<00:05:21.789> most<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.360> the

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
very very tricky because most of the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.870 
very very tricky because most of the
people<00:05:22.510> i<00:05:22.960> played<00:05:23.289> with<00:05:23.560> no<00:05:24.310> really<00:05:24.669> follow

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
people i played with no really follow

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.790 
people i played with no really follow
that<00:05:25.090> many<00:05:25.360> orders<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:26.020> was<00:05:26.200> lucky<00:05:26.560> enough<00:05:26.590> that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
that many orders I was lucky enough that

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.980 
that many orders I was lucky enough that
I<00:05:27.010> joined<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.400> couple<00:05:27.639> of<00:05:27.700> matches<00:05:27.849> where<00:05:28.330> my

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
I joined a couple of matches where my

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.050 
I joined a couple of matches where my
team<00:05:29.289> had<00:05:29.530> more<00:05:29.830> flags<00:05:30.220> than<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.580> enemy<00:05:30.880> team

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
team had more flags than the enemy team

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.089 
team had more flags than the enemy team
therefore<00:05:31.750> giving<00:05:32.050> me<00:05:32.169> more<00:05:32.349> assets<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:33.010> my

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
therefore giving me more assets to my

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.100 
therefore giving me more assets to my
disposal<00:05:33.729> therefore<00:05:34.180> giving<00:05:34.539> me<00:05:34.660> more<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:35.050> a

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
disposal therefore giving me more of a

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.800 
disposal therefore giving me more of a
chance<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.650> help<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.190> team<00:05:36.510> personally<00:05:37.510> I

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
chance to help the team personally I

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.350 
chance to help the team personally I
think<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.860> commander<00:05:39.340> mode<00:05:39.520> as<00:05:39.849> it<00:05:40.210> is

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
think that the commander mode as it is

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.300 
think that the commander mode as it is
it's<00:05:40.720> more<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.260> gimmick<00:05:41.650> rather<00:05:42.039> than<00:05:42.160> an

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
it's more of a gimmick rather than an

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.520 
it's more of a gimmick rather than an
actual<00:05:42.490> help<00:05:42.970> yes<00:05:43.389> you<00:05:43.599> can<00:05:43.630> scan<00:05:44.169> you<00:05:44.349> can

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
actual help yes you can scan you can

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.850 
actual help yes you can scan you can
give<00:05:44.740> out<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.099> team<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:47.080> heads<00:05:47.320> up<00:05:47.590> how<00:05:47.800> many

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
give out the team the heads up how many

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.770 
give out the team the heads up how many
enemies<00:05:48.370> that<00:05:48.520> in<00:05:48.669> the<00:05:48.760> area<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.360> can<00:05:49.510> drop<00:05:49.720> a

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
enemies that in the area you can drop a

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.570 
enemies that in the area you can drop a
supply<00:05:50.200> box<00:05:50.440> here<00:05:50.740> in<00:05:50.889> there<00:05:51.070> but<00:05:51.280> it's<00:05:51.430> all

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
supply box here in there but it's all

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.700 
supply box here in there but it's all
about<00:05:52.000> working<00:05:52.539> together<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.289> if<00:05:53.349> your<00:05:53.500> team

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
about working together and if your team

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.560 
about working together and if your team
doesn't<00:05:53.950> work<00:05:54.220> together<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:54.760> think<00:05:54.910> you're<00:05:55.300> not

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
doesn't work together I think you're not

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.210 
doesn't work together I think you're not
going<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.840> get<00:05:55.960> anywhere<00:05:56.200> obviously<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.950> can

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
going to get anywhere obviously you can

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.760 
going to get anywhere obviously you can
get<00:05:57.460> some<00:05:57.669> sweet<00:05:57.910> kills<00:05:58.240> with<00:05:58.450> it<00:05:58.570> but<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.470> think

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
get some sweet kills with it but I think

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.560 
get some sweet kills with it but I think
he's<00:05:59.979> not<00:06:00.190> really<00:06:00.520> making<00:06:00.729> that<00:06:01.000> huge<00:06:01.330> of<00:06:01.479> a

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
he's not really making that huge of a

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.360 
he's not really making that huge of a
difference<00:06:01.960> as<00:06:02.139> it<00:06:02.530> is<00:06:02.650> now<00:06:02.889> hopefully

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
difference as it is now hopefully

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.800 
difference as it is now hopefully
they'll<00:06:03.610> put<00:06:03.820> in<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.030> tomahawk<00:06:04.479> strike

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
they'll put in the tomahawk strike

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.870 
they'll put in the tomahawk strike
hopefully<00:06:05.289> they'll<00:06:05.470> put<00:06:05.650> him<00:06:05.680> a<00:06:05.979> couple<00:06:06.760> more

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
hopefully they'll put him a couple more

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.930 
hopefully they'll put him a couple more
things<00:06:06.940> maybe<00:06:07.450> in<00:06:07.660> an<00:06:07.780> update<00:06:07.930> or<00:06:08.320> a<00:06:08.349> patch

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
things maybe in an update or a patch

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.720 
things maybe in an update or a patch
but<00:06:09.570> you<00:06:09.780> need<00:06:10.050> a<00:06:10.260> little<00:06:10.590> bit<00:06:10.800> more<00:06:11.010> acid<00:06:11.310> to

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
but you need a little bit more acid to
