00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.809
 hi how are all these are 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.790
 elements that end in a minute 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.790
 as waste in the garbage a tire 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.090
 old pots of vegetables and afternoon drawers 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.090
 milk 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 but instead of voting them we can 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.820
 recycle make them a maintenance 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.250
 decorate it and use them as for example 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.439
 pot for our plants by 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.770
 example group painted jars and 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.600
 plant bulbs use the tire as 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.560
 part of a support to grow a 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.570
 climbing plant 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.670
 put in a drawer gramineae that 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.340
 they need little irrigation or to make a sector 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.180
 with pots and old teapots with mosses and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.180
 creeping plants 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.769
 she in the catalina already touches me and she's going 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.909
 to help the master potters first thing 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.500
 what you have to do tasting is to make 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.030
 perforations to all all on base to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.470
 the drainage of water and how they are made of metal 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.720
 we are going to do it with drill and local 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.060
 if they were made of plastic it can be done with 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.040
 a nail and a hammer the important thing is 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.110
 ensure drainage with three or four 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.700
 holes if the dogs had 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.350
 Sticky labels should be left 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.730
 soaking in hot water with a little 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.730
 of detergent to be released 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.110
 let's paint the jars white to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.940
 then make him over some 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 decoration and to paint them there are several 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.320
 ways capita is going to do it with 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.870
 synthetic enamel and roller to the jars 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.470
 guys and I 'm going to do it with spray 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.470
 the big jars 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.070
 the jars and we can leave them all 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.840
 whites or paint them in various colors and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.790
 make an entertaining composition but 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.640
 today we are going to decorate them with these 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.710
 essences a stencil is a template that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 serves as a mold to paint drawings or 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.030
 letters the stencil can also be 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.950
 manufacture taking some design from 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.759
 Internet or a book and transfer it to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.759
 a thick cardboard 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.490
 In addition to the template you can do 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.390
 a decoration with decals or even 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.390
 with plastic flowers 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.090
 here it is in the jars we are going to set aside 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.970
 these are irish because they are higher 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.709
 and since they are a bulb or a chip, you have to 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.870
 mix the soil with leaf of 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.230
 lampa for drainage so he was in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.409
 while to the mix 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.409
 do not 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.130
 I'm going to make another mind to promise another 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.270
 plant take advantage of all sand 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.270
 how is it so much 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.460
 ah 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.440
 i 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 bitch 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.970
 another material are these boxes of 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.900
 wooden vegetables that are even 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.120
 it could be a plastic box 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.860
 supermarkets but in this case and we're going 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.210
 to apply an asphalt product since 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.410
 this wood is in contact with the 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.540
 humidity 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.310
 It is applied with a brush inside the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.130
 drawer so it does not rot with watering 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.260
 once dry we put a plastic for 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.110
 that the earth does not come out and we make sure 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.610
 the drainage with several holes we 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.560
 we would make a corner of sun species and 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.760
 of low maintenance so we will raise 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 grasses like the karen 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.970
 Hello 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.380
 these tires do not have to make 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.930
 nothing with the subject of humidity nor 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.670
 neither drain and get to use a 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.470
 alternative is to put herbs and plants 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.450
 crawl and do as a drawing like that to 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.960
 ground level we are going to 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.210
 use to put this vine 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.370
 we place the tire in a place at 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.170
 semi shadow for these 1000 we put 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.210
 inside the tire 3 colihues de por 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.820
 at least 1 meter 20 and we tie them in 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.530
 the tip with a hemp thus forming a 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.370
 pyramid structure where I can 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.370
 climb the vine 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.530
 and here is the idea is that you throw 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.850
 land up to about half more or less 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.080
 to be able to plant and that we do not have 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.639
 very outside since the silver if you to the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.050
 Soya we already did the holes for 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.479
 draw then what we 're going to put 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.120
 are low plants like moss and 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.590
 lip that the one with the catalina the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.510
 idea is that the difference of greens and 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.510
 textures is very nice with aluminum 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.070
 the idea for these elements to be 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.380
 look and do not look like cachureos 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.420
 group them because if we leave a pot or 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.210
 a jar out there sure for not 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.509
 out of tune 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.509
 i 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.180
 and one last idea a bottle with a 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.070
 little water and a flower so 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.650
 we use like flowers you do not like it if it 's 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.449
 true so you know the sun comes out and 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.800
 take advantage of this time that comes uses 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.780
 your waste things like pretty 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.199
 flower pots encourage yourself 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.199
 state
