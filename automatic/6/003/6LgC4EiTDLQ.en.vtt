00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello guys welcome to the top 5 of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.009
 addictive games number 5 my name is 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.930
 emmanuel and you can find me in 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.370
 twitter arroba the Ticos apple 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.920
 fifth installment brings with it games of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.540
 a lot of quality so let's start the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.400
 position number 5 corresponds to crowe 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.719
 been one of those games to pass the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.279
 while waiting for some activity 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.320
 whether on the street at home or in 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 any place if you know the frob in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 this game will sound familiar to you is a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 mix of minecraft style graphics with 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 a game system very similar to that of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.869
 Toad advance without being eaten by 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.910
 screen that approaches us slowly 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.040
 where we are and without being trampled 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 or we fall to 1 we can move 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.670
 well left right in a simple way 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 and move forward we will have some coins for 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.530
 grab and there are more than 50 characters to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 unlock we continue with final that no 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.379
 I want to stop too much in this game 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.329
 since probably not all of them 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.950
 like this sport and prefer games 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.690
 more universal I'll tell you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940
 quickly a game of penalties where 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.020
 we can dispute different divisions and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.059
 with the game currency buy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 equipment train the team get 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.109
 balls and other skill seems simple 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.969
 but it is quite complex and although it 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.320
 missing polish details has a mode 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.479
 online very competitive and interesting 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.460
 and it is the turn of position number 3 on 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.260
 which corresponds to mei simpl and in the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.240
 same we are a small square that enjoys 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.680
 a gravity or a bit strange since if 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.120
 we press on the right side left 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.490
 of the screen we elevate it to the style 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.170
 flap and see but vertically a 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.880
 totally minimalist game but with a 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.580
 level of difficulty important and that you 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.020
 will serve to pass the time are left only 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.729
 two posts but if you're liking you 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.710
 I ask that please, I like the video 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.300
 many thanks 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.130
 now if we continue and how they will 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.509
 realized he tried to vary a bit the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.460
 theme of the games to cover the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.800
 more tastes and therefore the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.210
 of position number 2 is to help a 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.230
 game of the creative chillingo company 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.880
 from the famous catch the road 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.950
 in this case it brings us a different title 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.240
 all with levels that immerse us in 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.610
 a world of ice cream with an excellent 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.840
 gameplay we go over our vehicle 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.280
 and we have an umbrella that we 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.990
 will serve to go by certain levels with 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120
 greater precision of movement before 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.160
 the obstacles we have to unlock 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.630
 many items in the store and I wish 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.800
 you have known them before this title and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.470
 that was the car of the week 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.420
 approximately seven days and we finish 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.290
 with what is for me a title made 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.090
 with much same 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.100
 his name is impossible indro or in 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.780
 Spanish the impossible drawing if you 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.950
 remember is more hits the game that had 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.330
 a radio in this channel 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.800
 they probably recognize that world 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.750
 weird where were we going to some kind of 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.340
 cabin firing the different items 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.660
 that appeared on the screen and opened 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.970
 step breaking the glasses that we 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.560
 they put forward here is similar but 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.690
 we will have to draw the shape of the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.720
 door to advance seems easy but not 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 it is at all and the super recommend 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.810
