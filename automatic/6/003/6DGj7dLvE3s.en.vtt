table silicon and piccolina was a small

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.780 
table silicon and piccolina was a small
thing<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> i<00:00:36.480> picked<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:38.040> i<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.610> also

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
thing that i picked up and i have also

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
thing that i picked up and i have also
none<00:00:39.120> throttle<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:39.960> i<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
none throttle here which i will of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
none throttle here which i will of
course<00:00:40.860> compared<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.670> future<00:00:42.540> video<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
course compared in a future video and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
course compared in a future video and
also<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.410> bigger<00:00:43.649> common<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.239> think

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
also a bigger common and this is I think

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.380 
also a bigger common and this is I think
15<00:00:45.690> bucks<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:46.770> 20<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> 25<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
15 bucks and these are about 20 to 25 so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.060 
15 bucks and these are about 20 to 25 so
does<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> smallest<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> lightest<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> in

here<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> tripod<00:01:12.930> legs<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> little

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
here the tripod legs to make it a little

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
here the tripod legs to make it a little
bit<00:01:14.100> longer<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:15.330> kilogram<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
bit longer and one kilogram is the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
bit longer and one kilogram is the
maximum<00:01:16.500> weight<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.040> put<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.280> here

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
maximum weight that you can put on here

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
maximum weight that you can put on here
so<00:01:17.759> I've<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.030> gh2<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.350> OG<00:01:19.740> h<00:01:19.830> 2<00:01:20.040> i'm

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so I've my gh2 and my OG h 2 i'm

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
so I've my gh2 and my OG h 2 i'm
recording<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> gh3<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.570> i<00:01:21.720> could<00:01:21.990> put

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
recording with the gh3 here i could put

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
recording with the gh3 here i could put
on<00:01:22.560> top<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.920> example<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.430> should<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.820> under

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
on top for example that should be under

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080 
on top for example that should be under
1<00:01:24.780> kilo<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> already<00:01:26.189> said<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.670> 70

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
1 kilo and as I already said it's 70

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
1 kilo and as I already said it's 70
grams<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.540> let's<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.869> take<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.409> you

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
grams so let's just take it out of you

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.010 
grams so let's just take it out of you
of<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.920> original<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.030> case<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
of this original and case and the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.969 
of this original and case and the
product<00:01:31.320> numbers<00:01:31.560> by<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> way<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:33.229> 555<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
product numbers by the way and a 555 and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
product numbers by the way and a 555 and
it's<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.759> made<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.119> Germany<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's not made in Germany but it's a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.069 
it's not made in Germany but it's a
German<00:01:37.079> company<00:01:37.259> actually<00:01:37.619> common<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
German company actually common and so

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.330 
German company actually common and so
you<00:01:40.079> could<00:01:40.320> say<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> German<00:01:41.250> engineering

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you could say this is German engineering

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
you could say this is German engineering
or<00:01:42.030> German<00:01:42.450> design<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.049> guess<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> actually

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
or German design I guess but it actually

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
or German design I guess but it actually
doesn't<00:01:44.220> say<00:01:44.430> anything<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.299> there

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
doesn't say anything like that on there

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.780 
doesn't say anything like that on there
so<00:01:45.810> let<00:01:46.290> me<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.590> take<00:01:47.070> off<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.610> these

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
so let me just take off your these

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.200 
so let me just take off your these
little<00:01:48.060> things<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.250> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
little things and there we go and then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
little things and there we go and then
first<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.780> could<00:01:51.990> maybe<00:01:52.170> even

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
first of all we could maybe even

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.770 
first of all we could maybe even
compared<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.850> standard<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.450> year<00:01:54.630> old

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
compared with some standard one year old

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
compared with some standard one year old
device<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.680> see<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.460> about

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
device here as you can see it's about

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.319 
device here as you can see it's about
the<00:01:56.880> same<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.390> size<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.549> course<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.149> for

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the same in size but of course here for

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.569 
the same in size but of course here for
example<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:00.899> problem<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> these<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:01.979> really

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
example my problem is these are really

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.940 
example my problem is these are really
too<00:02:02.790> light<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.210> open<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.770> one

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
too light to open up and with my one

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
too light to open up and with my one
your<00:02:05.100> thing<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.640> yet<00:02:06.090> actually<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.020> what

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
your thing and yet actually this is what

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.219 
your thing and yet actually this is what
happens<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.879> can't<00:02:08.879> adjust<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
happens I can't adjust it to be just a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.630 
happens I can't adjust it to be just a
standard<00:02:10.530> height<00:02:10.770> they<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.190> go<00:02:11.459> like

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
standard height they really just go like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
standard height they really just go like
this<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.450> even<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.900> take<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
this and then even when I take out the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
this and then even when I take out the
legs<00:02:13.650> ok<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:14.069> are<00:02:14.160> quite<00:02:14.400> long<00:02:14.670> legs<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
legs ok they are quite long legs and it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.119 
legs ok they are quite long legs and it
doesn't<00:02:16.020> make<00:02:16.110> any<00:02:16.260> sense<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> use<00:02:16.709> them<00:02:16.890> since

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
doesn't make any sense to use them since

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.610 
doesn't make any sense to use them since
it's<00:02:17.310> above<00:02:17.610> 270<00:02:18.270> meters<00:02:18.390> above<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> table

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it's above 270 meters above the table

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's above 270 meters above the table
and<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.610> did<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.849> common<00:02:21.270> piccolino<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.930> quite

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and so did a common piccolino is quite

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.190 
and so did a common piccolino is quite
nice<00:02:22.379> since<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.459> legs<00:02:23.700> there's<00:02:24.690> only<00:02:24.840> three

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
nice since the legs there's only three

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.780 
nice since the legs there's only three
legs<00:02:25.349> here<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:25.980> only<00:02:26.190> move<00:02:26.370> two<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
legs here and you can only move two of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.210 
legs here and you can only move two of
them<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.660> always<00:02:28.080> an<00:02:28.379> going<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:28.980> way

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
them this is always an going this way

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
them this is always an going this way
then<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.120> move<00:02:30.269> here<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.629> head<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.019> top<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
then you can move here the head on top a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.869 
then you can move here the head on top a
little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.950> quite<00:02:32.280> nice<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.700> move

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
little bit it's quite nice to move

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.790 
little bit it's quite nice to move
actually<00:02:33.209> around<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.709> of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
actually around and and you can of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.220 
actually around and and you can of
course<00:02:34.830> twist<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.459> party<00:02:35.849> or<00:02:35.910> two<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.330> make<00:02:37.080> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
course twist a party or two and make it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.140 
course twist a party or two and make it
stick<00:02:37.349> in<00:02:37.530> one<00:02:37.860> position<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.819> can<00:02:38.970> also

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
stick in one position and you can also

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.440 
stick in one position and you can also
hear<00:02:39.569> take<00:02:40.110> an<00:02:40.349> outer<00:02:40.860> arm<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.300> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
hear take an outer arm a little bit and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.699 
hear take an outer arm a little bit and
then<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> part<00:02:43.349> where<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.560> can

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
then you have you the part where you can

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.640 
then you have you the part where you can
just<00:02:43.739> take<00:02:44.459> off<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.870> tripod<00:02:46.440> a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.199 
the little arm and it's of course also
nice<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.379> move<00:02:55.739> around<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.910> as<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> can

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
nice to move around a here as you can

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
nice to move around a here as you can
feel<00:02:57.629> right<00:02:57.810> now<00:02:57.959> or<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.349> right<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
feel right now or see right now and this

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.610 
feel right now or see right now and this
is<00:02:59.519> quite<00:03:00.120> easily<00:03:00.420> moving<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.290> will<00:03:01.440> not

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
is quite easily moving so if I will not

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.229 
is quite easily moving so if I will not
put<00:03:01.800> my<00:03:01.830> cam<00:03:02.159> on<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.550> for<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:03.000> through

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
put my cam on here for just through

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.869 
put my cam on here for just through
probably<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.930> poop<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.500> yeah<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.519> we

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
probably this poop and yeah that we

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.210 
probably this poop and yeah that we
don't<00:03:06.090> want<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.620> all<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> do

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
don't want that and so all I have to do

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.070 
don't want that and so all I have to do
is<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.430> twist<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.120> around<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.659> little<00:03:09.930> bit

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
is just twist this around a little bit

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.030 
is just twist this around a little bit
to<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> front<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.250> way<00:03:12.110> now<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:13.440> still

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
to the front that way now it's still

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.820 
to the front that way now it's still
quite<00:03:14.430> easy<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.810> move<00:03:15.810> now<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.680> getting

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
quite easy to move now it's getting

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.130 
quite easy to move now it's getting
harder<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.280> twist<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.879> here<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:18.840> also<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
harder to twist it here and it's also a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.140 
harder to twist it here and it's also a
little<00:03:19.290> bit<00:03:19.440> harder<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.860> move<00:03:20.159> it<00:03:20.340> around<00:03:20.489> here

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
little bit harder to move it around here

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.449 
little bit harder to move it around here
now<00:03:21.569> if<00:03:21.629> I<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.319> really<00:03:22.560> strong<00:03:22.860> closed<00:03:23.220> up

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
now if I do it really strong closed up

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.460 
now if I do it really strong closed up
really<00:03:23.730> strong<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.569> can<00:03:24.750> still<00:03:25.049> move<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
really strong here you can still move it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.160 
really strong here you can still move it
around<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.459> quite<00:03:27.120> hard<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.659> move<00:03:27.840> so

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
around but it's quite hard to move so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.140 
around but it's quite hard to move so
and<00:03:28.470> what<00:03:29.159> I<00:03:29.190> would<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.610> actually<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.090> don't

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and what I would like actually I don't

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.789 
and what I would like actually I don't
know<00:03:30.299> if<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:30.569> only<00:03:30.720> with<00:03:30.870> my<00:03:31.080> devices<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:31.769> I

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
know if it's only with my devices when I

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.070 
know if it's only with my devices when I
really<00:03:32.099> close<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.580> all<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.849> way<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
really close it up all the way I can and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.890 
really close it up all the way I can and
this<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.680> really<00:03:34.860> as<00:03:35.340> strong<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.360> can<00:03:36.569> do<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
this is really as strong as I can do it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.380 
this is really as strong as I can do it
it's<00:03:37.409> still<00:03:37.709> possible<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.940> move<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.299> around

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
it's still possible to move it around

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.210 
it's still possible to move it around
and<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.019> put<00:03:40.200> my<00:03:40.230> camera<00:03:40.620> on<00:03:40.769> here<00:03:41.040> actually

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and if I put my camera on here actually

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.580 
and if I put my camera on here actually
let<00:03:41.430> me<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.700> try<00:03:41.849> not<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.239> put<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:43.379> my

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
let me just try not to put and here my

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.729 
let me just try not to put and here my
gh<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.640> 2-1<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.659> I<00:03:45.690> hope<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.379> doesn't

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
gh a 2-1 here I hope that it doesn't

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.770 
gh a 2-1 here I hope that it doesn't
just<00:03:46.890> move<00:03:47.400> by<00:03:47.640> itself<00:03:47.670> which<00:03:48.360> could<00:03:48.659> of

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
just move by itself which could of

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:59.210 
just move by itself which could of
course<00:03:48.989> happen<00:03:52.459> here<00:03:53.459> we<00:03:53.580> go<00:03:53.810> so

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.180 

gh2<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.580> right<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:00.910> top<00:04:01.090> here<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:02.190> doesn't

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
gh2 is right on top here and doesn't

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.980 
gh2 is right on top here and doesn't
seem<00:04:03.550> like<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.850> wants<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.150> fall<00:04:04.240> off<00:04:04.570> but<00:04:04.720> if<00:04:04.870> I

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
seem like it wants to fall off but if I

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.650 
seem like it wants to fall off but if I
for<00:04:05.500> example<00:04:05.560> as<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:05.950> QC<00:04:06.340> shake<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.000> it

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
for example as a QC shake it it just it

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.600 
for example as a QC shake it it just it
goes<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.080> front<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.710> that's<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.130> little<00:04:09.460> bit

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
goes to the front so that's a little bit

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.220 
goes to the front so that's a little bit
of<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.850> drawback<00:04:10.240> here<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.660> other<00:04:10.810> ones<00:04:11.020> are

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
of a drawback here the other ones are

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.090 
of a drawback here the other ones are
really<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.860> lot<00:04:11.950> better<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.550> this<00:04:13.590> thing<00:04:14.590> let<00:04:15.010> me

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
really a lot better in this thing let me

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.910 
really a lot better in this thing let me
just<00:04:15.340> take<00:04:15.730> off<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.180> camera<00:04:16.510> now<00:04:16.660> there<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:17.739> go

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
just take off the camera now there we go

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.250 
just take off the camera now there we go
so<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.700> see<00:04:19.000> now<00:04:19.150> why<00:04:19.359> this<00:04:19.420> is<00:04:19.720> quite<00:04:19.930> handy

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
so you see now why this is quite handy

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.920 
so you see now why this is quite handy
on<00:04:20.350> top<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.799> otherwise<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.609> what<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.360> light

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
on top and otherwise and what I light

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.180 
on top and otherwise and what I light
actually<00:04:23.290> also<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.920> have<00:04:24.010> this

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
actually also is that you have this

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.240 
actually also is that you have this
double<00:04:24.580> step<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.530> double<00:04:26.530> steps<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.040> take

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
double step and double steps you to take

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.490 
double step and double steps you to take
them<00:04:27.430> out<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.330> quite<00:04:28.570> easy<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.020> do<00:04:29.290> this

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
them out and it's quite easy to do this

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.990 
them out and it's quite easy to do this
actually<00:04:29.920> but<00:04:30.100> you<00:04:30.130> can<00:04:30.460> actually<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.790> would

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
actually but you can actually I would

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.520 
actually but you can actually I would
say<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.210> have<00:04:31.300> three<00:04:31.660> positions<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:32.260> can<00:04:32.290> use

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
say you have three positions you can use

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.010 
say you have three positions you can use
them<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.860> completely<00:04:33.460> closed<00:04:33.820> half<00:04:34.180> open<00:04:34.720> or

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
them and completely closed half open or

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.980 
them and completely closed half open or
completely<00:04:35.560> open<00:04:35.980> between<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.720> steps<00:04:37.720> it's

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
completely open between the steps it's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.100 
completely open between the steps it's
really<00:04:38.320> actually<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:39.070> relatively<00:04:39.760> easy<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.420> to

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
really actually a relatively easy and to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.110 
really actually a relatively easy and to
adjust<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.830> but<00:04:42.340> they<00:04:42.520> actually<00:04:42.670> stick

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
adjust and but they actually stick

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.630 
adjust and but they actually stick
always<00:04:43.570> here<00:04:43.870> on<00:04:44.620> how<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.070> position<00:04:45.430> a

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
always here on how to position a

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.430 
always here on how to position a
completely<00:04:46.060> open<00:04:46.120> or<00:04:46.420> completely<00:04:46.750> closed<00:04:47.140> and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
completely open or completely closed and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.540 
completely open or completely closed and
so<00:04:48.070> yeah<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.600> was<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.290> common<00:04:50.830> piccolino<00:04:51.400> I

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
so yeah this was the common piccolino I

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.659 
so yeah this was the common piccolino I
will<00:04:51.760> have<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.950> comparison<00:04:53.950> video<00:04:54.130> also<00:04:54.310> soon

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
will have a comparison video also soon

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.730 
will have a comparison video also soon
up<00:04:54.880> with<00:04:55.060> other<00:04:55.240> two<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.350> guys<00:04:56.560> know

up with other two and so you guys know

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.050 
up with other two and so you guys know
if<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.160> spend<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.550> little<00:04:57.669> bit<00:04:57.760> more

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.550 
if you have to spend a little bit more
or<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.600> shouldn't<00:04:58.960> spend<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.410> can<00:04:59.950> totally

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560

tell you guys that the Coleman man
Magnus<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.669> copter<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.690> best<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.169> would<00:05:08.350> say

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
out the other video so 2x timepiece on

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.860
