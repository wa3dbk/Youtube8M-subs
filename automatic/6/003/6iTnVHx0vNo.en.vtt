00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
new ring so it's been sitting up here

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.259 
new ring so it's been sitting up here
for<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> long<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.640> rusted

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
for a long time because of this rusted

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
for a long time because of this rusted
on<00:00:27.359> pulley<00:00:27.710> it's<00:00:28.710> off<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.340> their

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
on pulley it's off one of these their

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.319 
on pulley it's off one of these their
westward<00:00:30.029> tractors<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.640> reason<00:00:33.000> i<00:00:33.090> have

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
westward tractors and the reason i have

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.360 
westward tractors and the reason i have
such<00:00:33.690> seen<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> engine<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.430> thing

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
such seen with the engine on that thing

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.590 
such seen with the engine on that thing
the<00:00:38.370> reason<00:00:38.700> these<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.940> such<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> pain<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the reason these are such a pain in the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
the reason these are such a pain in the
arse<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.850> thickness<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
arse is because of the thickness of the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.430 
arse is because of the thickness of the
actual<00:00:42.329> pulley<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:44.210> these<00:00:45.210> pulleys<00:00:45.480> are

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.500 

like<00:00:49.440> milled<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.700> solid<00:00:51.149> piece<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
like milled out of a solid piece of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.700 
like milled out of a solid piece of
metal<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.710> thick<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:57.710> because

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
metal like this that thick and because

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
metal like this that thick and because
they<00:00:58.890> were<00:00:58.949> never<00:00:59.780> greased<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.930> anything<00:01:01.289> when

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
they were never greased or anything when

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
they were never greased or anything when
they<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.800> originally<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.430> never<00:01:02.609> come

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they put on originally they never come

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.190 
they put on originally they never come
off<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> i'm<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:04.680> doing<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.900> using<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
off so i'm actually doing is using the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.330 
off so i'm actually doing is using the
sawzall<00:01:08.210> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> call<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.340> I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
sawzall if you want to call it I'm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
sawzall if you want to call it I'm
trying<00:01:11.580> top<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.450> half<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> see<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.200> pry

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
trying top it in half and see if can pry

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.410 
trying top it in half and see if can pry
it<00:01:13.500> open<00:01:13.850> enough<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> break<00:01:15.600> free

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
it open enough right to break free

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.910 
it open enough right to break free
there's<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> material<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> cut<00:01:19.770> through

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
there's a lot of material to cut through

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.990 
there's a lot of material to cut through
I've<00:01:20.070> been<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.729> about

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I've been going at this for about

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.240 
I've been going at this for about
probably<00:01:22.759> about<00:01:23.759> 15<00:01:24.240> 20<00:01:24.479> minutes<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> total

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
probably about 15 20 minutes in total

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
probably about 15 20 minutes in total
and<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.369> still<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and it's still not all the way there I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.039 
and it's still not all the way there I
dunno<00:01:28.970> not<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
dunno not really good to see that on the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.340 
dunno not really good to see that on the
camera<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.439> Oh<00:01:31.560> Hank<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.049> make<00:01:34.229> out

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
camera at Oh Hank you can just make out

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.149 
camera at Oh Hank you can just make out
so<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.770> halfway<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:36.590> lot<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.619> material

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
so like halfway there a lot of material

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.130 
so like halfway there a lot of material
to<00:01:38.189> cut<00:01:38.460> through<00:01:38.610> though<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:41.189> said

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
to cut through though that said

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
to cut through though that said
shouldn't<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.290> too<00:01:43.320> much<00:01:43.500> longer<00:01:44.630> then<00:01:45.630> I'll

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
shouldn't take too much longer then I'll

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.740 
shouldn't take too much longer then I'll
be<00:01:45.899> able<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> rebuild<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.630> might<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
be able to rebuild this I might actually

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.950 
be able to rebuild this I might actually
do<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.259> put<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.220> Trotter<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.750> needs

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
do is put it on this Trotter that needs

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
do is put it on this Trotter that needs
a<00:01:52.049> pulley<00:01:52.320> taken<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:52.950> well<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a pulley taken off as well but that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.260 
a pulley taken off as well but that
engines<00:01:55.170> basically<00:01:55.680> ready<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:58.439> one

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
engines basically ready to go this one

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.530 
engines basically ready to go this one
using<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> coil<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:02.180> don't<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> money

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
using you coil and don't have the money

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.260 
using you coil and don't have the money
to<00:02:03.659> put<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> yeah<00:02:06.090> that's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
to put into it right now so yeah that's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.770 
to put into it right now so yeah that's
another<00:02:07.550> nice<00:02:08.550> hint<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.090> anyone<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> send<00:02:09.660> me

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
shed this has come on a bit since you

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.820 
shed this has come on a bit since you
last<00:02:20.280> saw<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.550> probably<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.320> got<00:02:22.440> windows

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
last saw it probably you can got windows
