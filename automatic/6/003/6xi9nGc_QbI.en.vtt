didn't feel slack I didn't feel as

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.170 
didn't feel slack I didn't feel as
though<00:03:13.730> cyclone<00:03:14.209> was<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.540> great<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:15.050> mean<00:03:15.650> I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
though cyclone was that great I mean I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.780 
though cyclone was that great I mean I
fell<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.300> say<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.570> was<00:03:17.720> too<00:03:17.930> small<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.730> I'm<00:03:19.730> not

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
fell to say it was too small and I'm not

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.610 
fell to say it was too small and I'm not
too<00:03:20.209> sure<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.540> could<00:03:20.600> damage<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.320> mean<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
too sure if I could damage I mean it

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.229 
too sure if I could damage I mean it
does<00:03:21.769> about<00:03:23.620> think<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.800> take<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.730> level<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
does about think it take it level one it

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.170 
does about think it take it level one it
goes<00:03:26.390> like<00:03:26.600> 25<00:03:27.170> plus<00:03:27.650> whatever<00:03:28.459> damage<00:03:28.940> years

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
goes like 25 plus whatever damage years

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.670 
goes like 25 plus whatever damage years
now<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.660> mean<00:03:29.870> if<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.110> go<00:03:30.230> down<00:03:30.290> straight

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
now so I mean if you go down straight

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.150 
now so I mean if you go down straight
out<00:03:30.830> damage<00:03:31.220> wires<00:03:31.489> he's<00:03:32.150> got<00:03:32.420> definitely

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
out damage wires he's got definitely

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.229 
out damage wires he's got definitely
cyclone<00:03:34.160> will<00:03:34.340> definitely<00:03:34.760> have<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> lot<00:03:35.180> of

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
cyclone will definitely have a lot of

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.710 
cyclone will definitely have a lot of
damage<00:03:35.510> but<00:03:35.870> otherwise<00:03:36.680> I'm<00:03:37.269> articles<00:03:38.269> that

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
damage but otherwise I'm articles that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.020 
damage but otherwise I'm articles that
great<00:03:39.050> really<00:03:39.380> had<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> sort<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.920> those<00:03:40.190> really

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
great really had a sort of those really
