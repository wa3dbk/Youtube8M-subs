one<00:03:39.659> on<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.640> keep<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:42.000> going

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
until I see it says L and then it

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.599 
until I see it says L and then it
hatches<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.769> egg<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:49.609> they

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609

the<00:03:52.709> d-pad<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.400> don't<00:03:53.609> get<00:03:54.030> off<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:56.340> can

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
the d-pad you don't get off then you can

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.479 
the d-pad you don't get off then you can
take<00:03:56.670> me<00:03:56.730> down<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.599> don't<00:03:57.810> want<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.489> okay

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489

sit<00:03:59.549> down<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.970> is<00:04:00.120> my<00:04:00.239> guess

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.440 

therefore<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.650> hatch<00:04:09.890> soon<00:04:10.250> or<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.270> can<00:04:11.390> just

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
therefore the hatch soon or you can just

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.420 
therefore the hatch soon or you can just
do<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.990> why<00:04:12.230> watch<00:04:12.470> your<00:04:12.650> TV<00:04:12.860> or<00:04:13.070> something

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
like that once one matches it won't take

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.560 
like that once one matches it won't take
long<00:04:21.049> for<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.440> others<00:04:21.910> well<00:04:22.910> that's<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:23.240> it
