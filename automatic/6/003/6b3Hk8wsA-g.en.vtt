00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.910
 no 2 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.169
 w 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.879
 seems to me 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.879
 a strong decrease 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.910
 control 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 veluwemeer 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 he acquired her 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 when I mentioned big profits above 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 that's why I don't think so 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 that no longer works 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 beckbergen's turn 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 a good crowd 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 of course there must be no problem 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 but down again 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.649
 but then 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.139
 the mailbox 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.039
 by a quarter 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.039
 the areas 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.369
 make it right now 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.299
 I do not know anymore 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.209
 ahold after the square 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.209
 my neighbours 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.259
 don't know where 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.739
 tomorrow is on the rise 10 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.309
 nobody was injured 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.309
 this happens now i think now 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.540
 market forces
