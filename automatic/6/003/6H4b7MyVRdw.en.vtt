little bit about our upcoming expansion

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.580 
little bit about our upcoming expansion
called<00:00:23.400> Wealth<00:00:23.670> Nations<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.720> main<00:00:24.900> focus<00:00:25.350> is

called Wealth Nations the main focus is
trade<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.420> one<00:00:27.420> other<00:00:27.660> thing<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.869> makes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
trade and one other thing that makes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.900 
trade and one other thing that makes
trade<00:00:28.470> great<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:28.949> me<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.760> really

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
trade great for me is that it really

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 
trade great for me is that it really
drives<00:00:30.410> directions<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.619> conflict<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
drives directions for conflict and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
drives directions for conflict and
that's<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:32.940> something<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
that's really something that we want to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.049 
that's really something that we want to
strengthen<00:00:34.200> further<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.309> 12th<00:00:35.670> nations

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059

we won't give the player more tools to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
we won't give the player more tools to
create<00:00:38.280> conflicts<00:00:39.120> first<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.660> we're

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
create conflicts first of all we're

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
create conflicts first of all we're
going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> allow<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.730> fabricate<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> reason

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
going to allow you to fabricate a reason

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.729 
going to allow you to fabricate a reason
for<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> trade<00:00:42.780> war<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.469> we're<00:00:43.620> also

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
for a trade war and then we're also

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940 
for a trade war and then we're also
changing<00:00:44.489> how<00:00:44.730> trade<00:00:45.210> wars<00:00:45.510> work<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.800> also

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
changing how trade wars work we're also

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.740 
changing how trade wars work we're also
looking<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.640> trade<00:00:47.940> republics

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
looking at trade republics

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.770 
looking at trade republics
I<00:00:48.899> mean<00:00:49.739> merchants<00:00:50.100> Republic's<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:51.360> need<00:00:51.570> for

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I mean merchants Republic's in need for

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
I mean merchants Republic's in need for
they<00:00:51.960> were<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.829> had<00:00:52.980> lots<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> cool<00:00:53.460> bonuses

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
they were they had lots of cool bonuses

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.520 
they were they had lots of cool bonuses
but<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> roles<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.780> weak<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.260> they're

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
but the roles bit weak because they're

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
but the roles bit weak because they're
really<00:00:55.739> small<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> nation<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.820> Venice

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
really small like the nation of Venice

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.700 
really small like the nation of Venice
for<00:00:57.210> example<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> coastline<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
for example now just as the coastline so

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
for example now just as the coastline so
we<00:00:58.800> figure<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.820> why<00:01:00.239> keep<00:01:00.539> these

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we figure that you know why keep these

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
we figure that you know why keep these
people<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.800> giving<00:01:02.070> actually

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
people around so we're giving actually

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219 
people around so we're giving actually
giving<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.730> another<00:01:03.300> new<00:01:03.570> bonus<00:01:04.019> if

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
giving them another new bonus if

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
giving them another new bonus if
merchants<00:01:04.920> Republic<00:01:05.309> trades<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.060> area

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
merchants Republic trades in an area

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
merchants Republic trades in an area
where<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> own<00:01:06.990> provinces<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.220> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
where you own provinces that's not just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
where you own provinces that's not just
a<00:01:08.580> loss<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.240> instead<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.320> boost

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
a loss for you instead it will boost

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
a loss for you instead it will boost
production<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> province<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.600> will

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
production in that province you will

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
production in that province you will
have<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> feel<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> how<00:01:13.650> much<00:01:13.830> money<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.760> they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
have to feel that how much money do they

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.929 
have to feel that how much money do they
steal<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.009> how<00:01:17.009> much<00:01:17.280> production<00:01:17.850> do

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
steal from me and how much production do

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.219 
steal from me and how much production do
I<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.360> should<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> fight<00:01:18.900> them<00:01:19.080> or

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I get back should I fight them or

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.480 
I get back should I fight them or
shouldn't<00:01:19.470> mine<00:01:19.619> another<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
shouldn't mine another really

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
shouldn't mine another really
interesting<00:01:20.520> thing<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> we're<00:01:21.240> adding<00:01:21.420> for

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
interesting thing that we're adding for

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.469 
interesting thing that we're adding for
wealth<00:01:22.020> nations<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.740> history<00:01:23.250> people<00:01:23.880> hired

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
wealth nations in history people hired

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
wealth nations in history people hired
privateers<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> hijack<00:01:26.490> other

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
privateers to go out and hijack other

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
privateers to go out and hijack other
people's<00:01:27.030> ships<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.540> figure<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.020> have

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
people's ships and we figure we can have

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
people's ships and we figure we can have
this<00:01:28.350> too<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.890> added<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.280> new<00:01:29.460> mission<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this too we added a new mission that you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.490 
this too we added a new mission that you
can<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.509> their<00:01:30.720> trade<00:01:30.900> ships<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.320> that's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
can use their trade ships for that's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
can use their trade ships for that's
called<00:01:31.710> privateers<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.060> send<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.360> out

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
called privateers and you send them out

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
called privateers and you send them out
on<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.659> mission<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> trade

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
on a mission like you do with a trade

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
on a mission like you do with a trade
mission<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.329> instead<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> send<00:01:37.170> them<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
mission but instead you send them all to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.569 
mission but instead you send them all to
privateer<00:01:37.799> mission<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> means<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
privateer mission that it means that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.850 
privateer mission that it means that
you're<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.479> getting<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.079> much<00:01:40.170> money<00:01:40.470> but

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you're not getting in so much money but

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
you're not getting in so much money but
they're<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.280> worth<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
they're gonna be worth about one and a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
they're gonna be worth about one and a
half<00:01:42.570> twice<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.560> much<00:01:43.680> trade<00:01:44.070> power<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.579> used

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
half twice as much trade power that used

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
half twice as much trade power that used
to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.509> great<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> small

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to be so it's a great way for a small

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.219 
to be so it's a great way for a small
nation<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.640> hit<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.180> bigger<00:01:48.420> nations<00:01:48.720> trade

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
nation to hit the bigger nations trade

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
nation to hit the bigger nations trade
above<00:01:49.799> their<00:01:50.040> weight<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> speak<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.090> if

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
above their weight so to speak or if

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.210 
above their weight so to speak or if
there<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> portal<00:01:52.530> map<00:01:52.740> where<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:52.979> can't

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
there is a portal map where you can't

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
there is a portal map where you can't
direct<00:01:53.549> trade<00:01:53.820> back<00:01:54.180> home<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.810> then

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
direct trade back home to you then

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.020 
direct trade back home to you then
that's<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:56.040> something<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.880> right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's also something you can do right

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.389 
that's also something you can do right
and<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> final<00:01:58.350> thing<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.740> wanted<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> mention

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and the final thing I wanted to mention

called trade companies and in the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.060 
called trade companies and in the
previous<00:02:03.780> expansion<00:02:04.200> conquest<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.680> paradise

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
previous expansion conquest of paradise

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.570 
previous expansion conquest of paradise
we<00:02:05.399> added<00:02:05.579> colonial<00:02:06.240> nations<00:02:06.570> where<00:02:06.780> colonial

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
we added colonial nations where colonial

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.219 
we added colonial nations where colonial
was<00:02:07.790> independent<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.630> could<00:02:09.020> create

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
was independent and could create

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.780 
was independent and could create
problems<00:02:09.710> for<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.920> they<00:02:10.130> expand<00:02:10.460> it<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.640> their

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
problems for you they expand it on their

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.490 
problems for you they expand it on their
own<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.210> we<00:02:11.750> want<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.990> do<00:02:12.110> something

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500

different<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:12.980> trade<00:02:13.340> companies<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.120> trade

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
different with trade companies so trade

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.330 
different with trade companies so trade

places like Africa and East India and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.990 
places like Africa and East India and
India<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.980> these<00:02:19.100> countries<00:02:19.490> where<00:02:19.730> you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
India of these countries where you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
as you do that these provinces will be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.410 
as you do that these provinces will be
worth<00:02:24.650> much<00:02:24.920> more<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.310> trade<00:02:25.520> power<00:02:25.730> but<00:02:26.240> much

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
less in manpower and taxes so it's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.910 
less in manpower and taxes so it's
become<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.570> way<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.810> specializing<00:02:30.800> your

become a way of specializing your

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740 
become a way of specializing your
trading<00:02:31.220> empire<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.730> then<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:32.150> also<00:02:32.390> one

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
trading empire and then we also one

that we're having newly is that when

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.450 
that we're having newly is that when
your<00:02:35.780> neighbor<00:02:35.990> nations<00:02:36.920> are<00:02:37.040> more<00:02:37.220> primitive

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
your neighbor nations are more primitive

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.010 
your neighbor nations are more primitive
than<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.880> they<00:02:38.060> can<00:02:38.240> use<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.750> do

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
than you they can use this and do

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.390 
than you they can use this and do
something<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.440> they<00:02:39.740> can<00:02:39.920> Western<00:02:40.310> eyes

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
something because they can Western eyes

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.340 
something because they can Western eyes
they<00:02:40.640> can<00:02:40.790> learn<00:02:41.000> new<00:02:41.210> things<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.080> their

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
they can learn new things but if their

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.720 
they can learn new things but if their
neighboring<00:02:42.710> through<00:02:42.860> trade<00:02:43.100> company<00:02:43.550> they

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
neighboring through trade company they

neighboring through trade company they
can't<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.240> anymore<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.110> your<00:02:45.230> presence

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
can't do that anymore so your presence

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.360 
can't do that anymore so your presence
isn't<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.400> marked<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.800> India<00:02:48.800> for<00:02:48.890> example<00:02:48.950> if
