up<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> camera<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> bit<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.770> we'll<00:02:54.370> take<00:02:55.060> this

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
up the camera a bit so we'll take this

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.610 
up the camera a bit so we'll take this
out<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.600> very<00:02:55.900> first<00:02:56.230> time<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:02.260> smaller

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
out for the very first time it's smaller

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.290 
out for the very first time it's smaller
than<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.980> thought<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.459> would<00:03:03.610> be<00:03:03.850> that's<00:03:04.180> a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
than I thought it would be that's a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.540 
than I thought it would be that's a
definite<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.989> thought<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.770> was<00:03:05.950> gonna<00:03:06.100> be<00:03:06.190> way

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
definite I thought it was gonna be way

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.400 
definite I thought it was gonna be way
way<00:03:06.970> bigger<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.980> controller<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.760> very<00:03:09.790> nice

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
way bigger the controller is very nice

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.050 
way bigger the controller is very nice
so<00:03:11.410> what<00:03:11.560> we'll<00:03:11.709> do<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:11.980> we'll<00:03:12.280> take<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.880> out<00:03:13.000> of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
so what we'll do is we'll take it out of

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.850 
so what we'll do is we'll take it out of
the<00:03:13.120> box<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.890> see<00:03:14.890> how<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.250> goes<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.590> right

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
the box and see how it goes so right

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.690 
the box and see how it goes so right
here<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.000> some<00:03:19.510> parts<00:03:20.100> we<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
here we have some parts we have the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.170 
here we have some parts we have the
screwdriver<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.870> comes<00:03:23.080> with<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:24.180> USB

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
screwdriver that comes with it the USB

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.840 
screwdriver that comes with it the USB
for<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.570> camera<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:27.280> charge<00:03:27.550> cable

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
for the camera we have the charge cable

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.960 
for the camera we have the charge cable
as<00:03:28.120> well<00:03:28.150> for<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:29.130> as<00:03:30.130> long<00:03:30.190> as<00:03:30.489> with<00:03:30.820> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
as well for it as long as with the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.750 
as well for it as long as with the
quadcopter<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:33.190> guess<00:03:33.370> there's<00:03:33.610> nothing

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
quadcopter and I guess there's nothing

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.330 
quadcopter and I guess there's nothing
else<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.300> lose<00:03:34.480> but<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.380> get<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.830> quadcopter

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
else to lose but to get the quadcopter

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.570 
else to lose but to get the quadcopter
out<00:03:36.870> also<00:03:37.870> we<00:03:38.320> have<00:03:38.470> some<00:03:38.650> spare<00:03:38.980> blades<00:03:39.250> here

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
out also we have some spare blades here

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.650 
out also we have some spare blades here
as<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:39.940> could<00:03:40.090> see<00:03:41.190> we'll<00:03:42.190> get<00:03:42.310> this

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
as we could see we'll get this

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:54.530 
as we could see we'll get this
quadcopter<00:03:43.660> out<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.720> can

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:05.100 

very<00:03:55.540> confusing<00:03:56.080> thing<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:04.629> we'll<00:04:04.810> get<00:04:04.900> this

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
very confusing thing so we'll get this

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:14.539 
very confusing thing so we'll get this
quadcopter<00:04:05.410> out<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:11.019> guys<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.349> one<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.620> them

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.009 

there's<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.700> other<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.150> let<00:04:16.449> me<00:04:16.570> turn<00:04:16.720> on<00:04:16.780> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
there's the other and let me turn on the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.319 
there's the other and let me turn on the
light<00:04:17.229> okay<00:04:18.040> so<00:04:18.100> there's<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> quadcopter<00:04:18.820> and

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
light okay so there's the quadcopter and

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.290 
light okay so there's the quadcopter and
we'll<00:04:19.930> take<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.139> little<00:04:20.410> look<00:04:20.650> at<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:22.060> here

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
we'll take a little look at it so here

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.409 
we'll take a little look at it so here
we<00:04:22.450> have<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.780> camera<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.410> it's<00:04:24.160> way<00:04:24.550> way<00:04:24.940> way

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
we have the camera and it's way way way

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.360 
we have the camera and it's way way way
smaller<00:04:25.479> than<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.260> thought<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.650> ever<00:04:26.830> be<00:04:27.130> I

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
smaller than I thought it ever be I

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.490 
smaller than I thought it ever be I
thought<00:04:28.330> this<00:04:28.419> quadcopter<00:04:28.690> was<00:04:29.139> going<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.350> be

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
thought this quadcopter was going to be

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.000 
thought this quadcopter was going to be
like<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:31.000> size<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.330> my<00:04:31.389> old<00:04:31.660> helicopter<00:04:32.290> but

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
like the size of my old helicopter but

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.610 
like the size of my old helicopter but
this<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.430> like<00:04:33.639> extremely<00:04:34.630> small<00:04:35.110> compared<00:04:35.560> to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
this is like extremely small compared to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560 
this is like extremely small compared to
what<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.770> was<00:04:35.860> expecting<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:37.150> also<00:04:37.300> very

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
what I was expecting and it's also very

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.740 
what I was expecting and it's also very
light<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:39.160> there's<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.610> quadcopter<00:04:39.850> here<00:04:40.630> we

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
light so there's a quadcopter here we

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.650 
light so there's a quadcopter here we
have<00:04:40.900> some<00:04:41.490> light<00:04:42.490> protectors<00:04:43.060> we're

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
have some light protectors we're

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.969 
have some light protectors we're
probably<00:04:43.840> going<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.139> be<00:04:44.229> using<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.650> for<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
probably going to be using that for the

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.200 
probably going to be using that for the
first<00:04:45.190> time<00:04:45.370> flying<00:04:45.729> we<00:04:46.570> have<00:04:46.780> our<00:04:48.000> USB<00:04:49.000> and

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
first time flying we have our USB and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.540 
first time flying we have our USB and
our<00:04:49.300> screwdriver<00:04:49.720> again

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.750 

yay<00:04:54.550> Gary<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.060> screwdriver<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.010> USB<00:04:59.580> we<00:05:00.580> have

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
yay Gary the screwdriver and USB we have

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.240 
yay Gary the screwdriver and USB we have
an<00:05:00.880> instruction<00:05:01.840> manual<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.500> as<00:05:02.950> you<00:05:03.099> can<00:05:03.190> see

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
an instruction manual and as you can see

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.129 
an instruction manual and as you can see
this<00:05:03.490> is<00:05:03.639> version<00:05:03.849> 2<00:05:04.300> which<00:05:04.599> is<00:05:04.750> very<00:05:04.930> nicely

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
this is version 2 which is very nicely

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.779 
this is version 2 which is very nicely
excited<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.680> see<00:05:05.800> one<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:07.300> if<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.580> where's<00:05:09.580> the

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
excited to see one and if I where's the

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.310 
excited to see one and if I where's the
battery<00:05:10.150> on<00:05:10.300> this<00:05:10.450> thing<00:05:10.660> anyway<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.229> think

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
battery on this thing anyway I think

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.700 
battery on this thing anyway I think
it's<00:05:11.650> already<00:05:12.039> in<00:05:12.250> there<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.639> just<00:05:13.270> oh<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.590> is

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
it's already in there so just oh it is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.650 
it's already in there so just oh it is
it<00:05:14.889> yeah<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.190> USB<00:05:15.460> charger<00:05:15.760> but<00:05:16.270> we'll<00:05:16.450> get

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
it yeah the USB charger but we'll get

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.770 
it yeah the USB charger but we'll get
this<00:05:16.840> out<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.380> we'll<00:05:17.530> see<00:05:17.770> if<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:19.419> batteries

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
this out and we'll see if the batteries

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.589 
this out and we'll see if the batteries
in<00:05:19.930> there<00:05:20.490> I'm<00:05:21.490> not<00:05:21.700> sure<00:05:21.849> how<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.090> open<00:05:22.479> this

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
in there I'm not sure how you open this

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.140 
in there I'm not sure how you open this
I<00:05:22.840> don't<00:05:23.020> want<00:05:23.139> to<00:05:23.200> break<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:26.820> there<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.940> go

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
I don't want to break it there you go

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.810 
I don't want to break it there you go
so<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.660> just<00:05:28.840> slides<00:05:29.050> out<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.470> then<00:05:29.710> there<00:05:30.700> we

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
so I just slides out and then there we

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.409 
so I just slides out and then there we
have<00:05:31.030> our<00:05:31.060> small<00:05:31.690> battery<00:05:32.110> so<00:05:33.099> we'll<00:05:33.419> we'll

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
have our small battery so we'll we'll

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.190 
have our small battery so we'll we'll
just<00:05:34.450> pull<00:05:34.840> that<00:05:35.020> battery<00:05:35.620> out<00:05:36.660> if<00:05:37.660> we<00:05:37.840> can't

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
just pull that battery out if we can't

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.029 
just pull that battery out if we can't
yep<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:40.300> go<00:05:40.419> it's<00:05:40.570> a<00:05:40.690> very<00:05:40.930> small<00:05:41.320> battery<00:05:41.440> I'm

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
yep you go it's a very small battery I'm

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.580 
yep you go it's a very small battery I'm
thinking<00:05:42.610> if<00:05:42.729> I<00:05:42.849> could<00:05:42.910> use<00:05:43.360> my<00:05:43.410> turnigy<00:05:44.410> you'd

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
thinking if I could use my turnigy you'd

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.890 
thinking if I could use my turnigy you'd
be<00:05:44.740> very<00:05:44.919> good<00:05:45.039> you'd<00:05:45.820> probably<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.389> better

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
be very good you'd probably have better

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.140 
be very good you'd probably have better
battery<00:05:47.260> life<00:05:47.320> over<00:05:47.680> here<00:05:47.710> could<00:05:48.700> just<00:05:48.880> take<00:05:49.120> a

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
battery life over here could just take a

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.310 
battery life over here could just take a
look<00:05:49.240> at<00:05:49.389> that<00:05:49.510> battery<00:05:51.930> sorry<00:05:52.930> if<00:05:53.050> you<00:05:53.139> can't

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
look at that battery sorry if you can't

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.940 
look at that battery sorry if you can't
see<00:05:53.410> I'll<00:05:53.620> probably<00:05:53.940> do<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:54.970> further<00:05:55.300> maybe<00:05:55.950> of

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
see I'll probably do a further maybe of

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.649 
see I'll probably do a further maybe of
that<00:05:57.400> battery<00:05:57.760> but<00:05:58.060> we'll<00:05:58.210> put<00:05:58.330> that<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.630> the

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
that battery but we'll put that to the

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.150 
that battery but we'll put that to the
side

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
side

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.790 
side
and<00:06:01.120> yeah<00:06:01.480> I<00:06:01.510> guess<00:06:01.810> there's<00:06:02.020> not<00:06:02.140> much<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.650> do

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
and yeah I guess there's not much to do

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.230 
and yeah I guess there's not much to do
right<00:06:03.040> now<00:06:03.250> that<00:06:03.280> I<00:06:03.550> guess<00:06:03.820> that's<00:06:04.030> the

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
right now that I guess that's the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.570 
right now that I guess that's the
unboxing<00:06:04.480> part<00:06:05.140> of<00:06:05.260> it<00:06:05.380> oh<00:06:05.590> yeah<00:06:06.190> we'll<00:06:06.370> take<00:06:06.520> a

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
unboxing part of it oh yeah we'll take a

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.630 
unboxing part of it oh yeah we'll take a
look<00:06:06.850> at<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.420> controller<00:06:08.160> so<00:06:09.160> here<00:06:09.370> we<00:06:09.490> have

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
look at the controller so here we have

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.940 
look at the controller so here we have
the<00:06:09.760> controller<00:06:10.150> well<00:06:10.840> we<00:06:11.320> have<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.710> fake

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
the controller well we have the fake

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.430 
the controller well we have the fake
buttons<00:06:12.370> here<00:06:12.700> we<00:06:13.330> have<00:06:13.570> more<00:06:13.960> fake<00:06:14.140> buttons

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
buttons here we have more fake buttons

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.070 
buttons here we have more fake buttons
here<00:06:14.590> we<00:06:15.100> have<00:06:15.250> these<00:06:15.460> square<00:06:16.390> protectors<00:06:16.960> I

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
here we have these square protectors I

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.290 
here we have these square protectors I
guess<00:06:17.230> for<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.850> controller<00:06:18.850> we<00:06:19.030> don't<00:06:19.210> really

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
guess for the controller we don't really

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.230 
guess for the controller we don't really
need<00:06:19.480> them<00:06:19.630> anymore<00:06:19.840> we<00:06:20.140> have<00:06:20.680> the<00:06:21.240> throttle

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
need them anymore we have the throttle

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.460 
need them anymore we have the throttle
here<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:23.590> movement<00:06:26.130> yeah<00:06:27.130> I<00:06:27.400> guess<00:06:27.640> it's<00:06:27.820> the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
here the movement yeah I guess it's the

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.570 
here the movement yeah I guess it's the
I'm<00:06:29.470> not<00:06:29.680> sure<00:06:29.950> what<00:06:30.100> to<00:06:30.190> say<00:06:30.220> about<00:06:30.370> the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
I'm not sure what to say about the

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.520 
I'm not sure what to say about the
control<00:06:30.910> it's<00:06:31.480> a<00:06:31.510> normal<00:06:31.780> controller<00:06:32.140> I<00:06:32.260> guess

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
control it's a normal controller I guess

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.940 
control it's a normal controller I guess
so<00:06:33.630> here<00:06:34.630> we<00:06:34.750> have<00:06:34.960> I<00:06:35.260> guess<00:06:35.530> some<00:06:35.800> of<00:06:35.830> the

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
so here we have I guess some of the

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.620 
so here we have I guess some of the
function<00:06:36.370> buttons<00:06:36.700> we<00:06:37.000> have<00:06:37.030> our<00:06:37.390> camera

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
function buttons we have our camera

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.840 
function buttons we have our camera
button<00:06:37.990> if<00:06:38.050> you<00:06:38.170> push<00:06:38.380> down<00:06:38.590> here<00:06:38.860> we<00:06:39.520> have<00:06:39.700> the

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
button if you push down here we have the

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.530 
button if you push down here we have the
trim<00:06:40.120> buttons<00:06:41.940> yeah<00:06:42.940> I<00:06:42.970> guess<00:06:43.180> that's<00:06:43.360> all<00:06:43.510> for

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
trim buttons yeah I guess that's all for

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.210 
trim buttons yeah I guess that's all for
the<00:06:43.870> controller<00:06:44.200> and<00:06:44.440> also<00:06:44.770> that<00:06:44.890> screen

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
the controller and also that screen

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.960 
the controller and also that screen
we'll<00:06:45.850> see<00:06:46.000> how<00:06:46.180> that<00:06:46.240> screen<00:06:46.660> does<00:06:47.230> later<00:06:47.680> on

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
we'll see how that screen does later on

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.220 
we'll see how that screen does later on
but<00:06:48.970> yeah<00:06:49.620> I<00:06:51.150> guess<00:06:52.150> that's<00:06:52.360> it<00:06:52.540> so<00:06:52.570> I'll<00:06:53.020> see

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
but yeah I guess that's it so I'll see

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.200 
but yeah I guess that's it so I'll see
if<00:06:53.260> I<00:06:53.410> could<00:06:53.560> get<00:06:53.710> some<00:06:53.920> batteries<00:06:54.610> somewhere

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
if I could get some batteries somewhere

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.430 
if I could get some batteries somewhere
in<00:06:55.330> my<00:06:55.480> house<00:06:55.720> and<00:06:56.430> yeah
