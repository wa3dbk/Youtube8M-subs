00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.529 
step six blow five drop and the floor
drop<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.950> we<00:01:24.490> go<00:01:24.640> down<00:01:24.789> one<00:01:24.969> more<00:01:25.000> note<00:01:25.390> it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
drop if we go down one more note it

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.990 
drop if we go down one more note it
would<00:01:25.630> be<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:25.810> four<00:01:25.990> blow

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
would be the four blow

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.330 
would be the four blow
and<00:01:28.300> let's<00:01:28.510> come<00:01:28.660> back<00:01:28.690> up<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.110> four<00:01:29.380> draw

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
and let's come back up to the four draw

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.190 
and let's come back up to the four draw
okay<00:01:32.240> we're<00:01:32.390> not<00:01:32.450> gonna<00:01:32.570> go<00:01:32.780> down<00:01:32.810> into<00:01:33.079> that

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
okay we're not gonna go down into that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600 
okay we're not gonna go down into that
bottom<00:01:33.500> octave<00:01:33.829> yeah<00:01:33.950> that's<00:01:34.159> quite<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.399> bit

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
bottom octave yeah that's quite a bit

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.310 
bottom octave yeah that's quite a bit
more<00:01:35.090> challenging<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:35.840> get<00:01:35.960> down<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.259> that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
more challenging to get down to that

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.380 
more challenging to get down to that
bottom<00:01:36.680> octave<00:01:37.040> we'll<00:01:37.880> deal<00:01:38.000> with<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.270> in

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
bottom octave we'll deal with that in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.210 
bottom octave we'll deal with that in
the<00:01:38.420> future<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.439> middle<00:01:39.740> octave<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.189> a

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
the future but this middle octave is a

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.090 
the future but this middle octave is a
really<00:01:40.640> nice<00:01:40.820> tasty<00:01:41.329> place<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.750> be<00:01:41.920> let's<00:01:42.920> play

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
really nice tasty place to be let's play

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.520 
really nice tasty place to be let's play
that<00:01:43.310> blue<00:01:43.460> scale<00:01:43.700> now<00:01:43.909> together<00:01:44.289> okay<00:01:45.289> here

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
that blue scale now together okay here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:02:01.280 
that blue scale now together okay here
we<00:01:45.619> go

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:14.730 

repeating<00:02:02.160> that<00:02:02.280> note<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.610> coming<00:02:02.880> down

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:25.559 

a<00:02:16.500> little<00:02:17.500> bit<00:02:17.590> faster<00:02:17.980> now

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.820 

coming<00:02:26.569> back<00:02:26.690> down

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:59.290 

and<00:02:33.830> even<00:02:34.100> pasture<00:02:41.410> again<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:50.450> faster<00:02:58.300> okay

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
and even pasture again and faster okay

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.480 
and even pasture again and faster okay
so<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.780> gets<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.290> familiar<00:03:01.070> there<00:03:01.220> with<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
so that gets you familiar there with the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.190 
so that gets you familiar there with the
blue<00:03:01.670> scale<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.300> third<00:03:02.480> position<00:03:02.990> in<00:03:03.110> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
blue scale in third position in the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.320 
blue scale in third position in the
middle<00:03:03.440> octave<00:03:03.590> we<00:03:04.490> can<00:03:04.610> also<00:03:04.760> play<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.180> third

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
middle octave we can also play in third

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.850 
middle octave we can also play in third
position<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.960> top<00:03:06.140> octave<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.710> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
position in the top octave and the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.790 
position in the top octave and the
bottom<00:03:07.160> octave<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.470> going<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.710> be

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
bottom octave and and that's going to be

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.620 
bottom octave and and that's going to be
really<00:03:10.010> fun<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.640> challenging<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.450> rewarding

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
really fun and challenging and rewarding

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.960 
really fun and challenging and rewarding
in<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.050> future<00:03:12.410> but<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.370> thing<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:13.730> can

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
in the future but one thing that you can

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.760 
in the future but one thing that you can
do<00:03:14.120> now<00:03:14.270> is<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.600> start<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.080> think<00:03:15.110> about<00:03:15.410> a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
do now is you can start to think about a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.510 
do now is you can start to think about a
lick<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:18.950> play<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.280> cross

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
lick in that you like to play in cross

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.790 
lick in that you like to play in cross
harp<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.000> sort<00:03:20.210> of<00:03:20.360> translate<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.410> now<00:03:21.530> into

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
harp and sort of translate it now into

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.830 
harp and sort of translate it now into
third<00:03:21.980> position<00:03:22.160> I'll<00:03:22.580> give<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:23.690> as

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
third position I'll give this to you as

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.710 
third position I'll give this to you as
an<00:03:24.020> example<00:03:24.560> okay<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.670> cross<00:03:25.910> harp<00:03:26.240> if<00:03:26.570> I

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
an example okay so in cross harp if I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.220 
an example okay so in cross harp if I
was<00:03:26.900> doing<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.440> four<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:29.150> five<00:03:29.180> like<00:03:29.900> bending

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
was doing the four to five like bending

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.010 
was doing the four to five like bending
the<00:03:30.380> four<00:03:30.560> draw<00:03:30.800> going<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> five<00:03:31.460> and<00:03:31.490> then

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
the four draw going to the five and then

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.800 
the four draw going to the five and then
resolving<00:03:33.020> it<00:03:33.200> down<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.560> two<00:03:33.680> like<00:03:33.890> this

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.940
