00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.580
 Hello, today I want to say about 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.240
 clutch belt tension 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.799
 cultivators sadko and so to get 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.270
 immediate dreams do not need to be removed 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.570
 a protective cover on the crisis but two 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.570
 bolted 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:43.670
 and remove the cover what we see we 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.329
 see we lead this with the bags on 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.460
 two streams 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:55.960
 two belts are coming here this video is going 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 on the handle grip here it see 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.330
 respectively when lowering the roller with 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 throwing the clutch lowers the rabbit down 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.270
 the cultivator stands when you press the lever 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.880
 clutch jump clutch will start roller 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.050
 create the necessary stretch and 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.740
 naturally the cultivator we have passed in 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:23.560
 work and so of course the cultivator goes 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 instruction on which are valid 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.450
 the dimensions that is this distance 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.420
 how much should be tightened 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.789
 the distance here here here goes all 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.509
 distance but trying to adjust by 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.049
 instructions 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.420
 It turned out that you accepted at all 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.490
 stopped working that is it just when 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.820
 starter level stupidly on black more precisely 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.710
 even 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.299
 well when standing on neutral stood 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.439
 naturally shifting he 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.530
 immediately began to jerk 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.850
 go even when pressed gun and grip 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.810
 and so what was the essence of the essence 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.329
 turned out to be that 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.479
 instructions on figs everything is configured 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:10.280
 much easier what to do to 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.750
 set up phenomena if she if you 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.430
 stretched belt either you set 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 belt number when you started there rollers 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:28.100
 that is, a belt dinner like this 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.190
 he should scroll freely 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.660
 go around here this video 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.330
 leading if it is a little bit the same 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.410
 go, then everything will disappear again 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.540
 grip and being tailor for sciences 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.700
 settle everything just hasana with 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 the movement of the engine in pairs that is 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.810
 here is one and the second bolt 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.660
 this is if viewed from the front of the cultivator 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.170
 which we unscrew 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.640
 also very well there is 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.520
 whether there will be the same was on the other 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.540
 side another bolt 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.180
 here directly here here 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 accordingly what needs to be done for 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.220
 settings for me let go all 5 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.410
 bolts 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.300
 move the engine forward or backward 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.640
 seeking the right institution again 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.989
 I repeat that when I am free 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.560
 circled around this front 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.560
 video and should not just be removed 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.660
 now it does not take off need a little 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.640
 little effort dreaming because 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.380
 when the belt is stretched it just like that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.980
 here you are shooting without any problems now 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.160
 we are a little stretched here I am 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.640
 set up an expert indicative then 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.640
 there is one more time i need to fall in love 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.340
 such tension to make it clear 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.019
 no borders that is sensitive as indicated in 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.569
 instructions anyway my case 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.700
 it did not work that is, we seek to 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.750
 belt 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.040
 freely circled around here this 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 pulley or roller as its correct 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.850
 name I don't know and then you will get 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.580
 normal clutch work another 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.960
 momentous moment three after that 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.979
 more precisely how you tune the grip 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.099
 try everything works fine 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.410
 you need to make sure that these 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.210
 two pulleys are in the same plane 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.210
 what during you move 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.509
 engine it can turn a little 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.389
 and accordingly will work 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:49.539
 time that is taken 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.449
 either the board is flat or a piece of the corners 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.990
 attached here and here 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:59.470
 pulleys are set in 1 kop plane and 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:03.460
 everything is basically everything that is nothing 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.909
 nothing really serious about this 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.550
 there is no setting but according to the instructions again 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.720
 I will say I did not manage to set up something 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.680
 have got to set up 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:19.449
 at random by picking up tension 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:22.020
 belt yourself not today everything up 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.020
 new meetings
