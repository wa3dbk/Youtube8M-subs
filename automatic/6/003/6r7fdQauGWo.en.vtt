00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.830
 i 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.590
 it is easier to separate a wave from the sand 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 to separate us from the snow measures snow 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.630
 and everything revolves around her 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.820
 my link with the snow comment the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.550
 five years when my daughter had to 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.440
 fit skis for the first time 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.199
 I learned to ski I started competing 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 little at the club level and just one day 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.760
 a table appears on my side and since 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.300
 because only then wanted to do 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.300
 snowboard 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.259
 when I already had a little bit of level already 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 I went down all the tracks had 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.509
 speed I said good I'm going to two meters 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.850
 beyond the beacon to see what happens and 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.939
 those four turns in powder snow were 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.060
 brutal feel free silence the 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.210
 mountain is to catch my power lines by 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 here I can go over there 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.930
 and it was the moment they say that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.930
 it could not be written 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.549
 Y 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.400
 in the end the snow for me is a way of 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.600
 escape 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.970
 i have any problem i am 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.400
 worried about something and looked up 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.310
 of a mountain and that problem is already done 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.370
 small there is nothing difficult in a day 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.100
 good snowmass put on their boots 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.950
 houses that you look for your line and low 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.739
 and you enjoy 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.239
 I am anna I am savior of Biescas 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.209
 a small village at the entrance to the valley of 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.170
 he was happy and happy to be born and raised 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.170
