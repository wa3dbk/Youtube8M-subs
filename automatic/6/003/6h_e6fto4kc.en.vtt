brass beast such a beast ok pro of plus
twenty<00:01:46.979> percent<00:01:47.280> damage<00:01:47.610> bonus<00:01:48.079> therefore

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
twenty percent damage bonus therefore

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.649 
twenty percent damage bonus therefore
more<00:01:49.320> damage<00:01:49.799> per<00:01:50.070> round<00:01:50.240> however<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> cons

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
more damage per round however the cons

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.990 
more damage per round however the cons
here<00:01:51.960> fifty<00:01:52.770> percent<00:01:53.100> slower<00:01:53.490> span<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.790> time

here fifty percent slower span of time

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.249 
here fifty percent slower span of time
that<00:01:54.060> means<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> hold<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:54.899> click<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that means when you hold right click it

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.480 
that means when you hold right click it
just<00:01:55.409> takes<00:01:55.710> longer<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.369> deploy

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
just takes longer to actually deploy

trying to pop them in the face it would

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
trying to pop them in the face it would
just<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.860> always<00:02:39.070> brass<00:02:39.490> B's<00:02:39.790> because<00:02:40.360> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
just be always brass B's because it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.980 
just be always brass B's because it
deploys<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.380> unleashes<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.910> much<00:02:43.090> damage<00:02:43.600> up

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.680 
deploys for unleashes so much damage up
close<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.770> incredible<00:02:45.610> when<00:02:46.390> using

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
close it's just incredible when using

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.510 
close it's just incredible when using
this<00:02:46.810> loadout<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.410> noticed<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.040> lot<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.310> my

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
could not move as well when the weapon
