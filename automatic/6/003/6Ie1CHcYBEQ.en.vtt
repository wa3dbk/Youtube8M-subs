there's the keen conversion right there
with<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> 80<00:00:20.670> 52<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.350> Joel<00:00:22.650> sluice<00:00:23.279> box

with the 80 52 and a Joel sluice box
running<00:00:27.080> pretty<00:00:28.080> happy<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:30.260> think<00:00:31.260> I've<00:00:31.380> got<00:00:31.529> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
running pretty happy I think I've got my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.020 
running pretty happy I think I've got my
water<00:00:31.920> flow<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.880> right

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.760 

father<00:00:41.030> we<00:00:41.270> could<00:00:41.450> turn<00:00:41.690> down<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.170> water<00:00:42.470> flow

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
father we could turn down the water flow

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:59.920 
father we could turn down the water flow
just<00:00:43.130> a<00:00:43.340> little<00:00:43.640> bit

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.600 

I<00:01:00.040> think<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.190> water<00:01:01.400> flows<00:01:01.700> much<00:01:01.970> better<00:01:03.610> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
I think that water flows much better and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.690 
I think that water flows much better and
he<00:01:04.730> throws<00:01:05.330> out<00:01:05.660> there<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:07.070> he<00:01:07.190> helped<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.580> be

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
he throws out there and he helped it be

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.640 
he throws out there and he helped it be
good

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830 

this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.790> inch-and-a-half<00:01:12.180> system

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this is an inch-and-a-half system

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.980 
this is an inch-and-a-half system
pumping<00:01:13.440> runs<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.220> pole<00:01:15.060> max<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.630> 52

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
pumping runs that a pole max of 52

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
pumping runs that a pole max of 52
gallons<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> minute<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:19.250> we're<00:01:20.250> just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
gallons a minute and we're just

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.550 
gallons a minute and we're just
experimenting<00:01:21.120> here<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.950> stuff<00:01:22.950> today

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
experimenting here with stuff today

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
little break from metal detector and up

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.590 
little break from metal detector and up
here<00:01:45.690> in<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> state<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.110> Maine<00:01:47.420> what<00:01:48.420> we're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
here in a state of Maine what we're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.930 
here in a state of Maine what we're
working<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.080> right<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:50.600> we<00:01:51.600> did<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> little

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
working with right now we did a little

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.730 
working with right now we did a little
dowsing<00:01:53.940> right<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.780> dart<00:01:55.259> spot<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
dowsing right where that dart spot is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.020 
dowsing right where that dart spot is
just<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.070> other<00:01:56.160> side<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.910> was

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
just the other side of that we was

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.310 
just the other side of that we was
getting<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.450> strong<00:01:57.840> X's<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.990> might<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
getting some strong X's so we might do a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.540 
getting some strong X's so we might do a
little<00:02:01.440> digging<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:01.920> before<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.400> all

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
little digging there before with all

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.330 
little digging there before with all
experiment<00:02:03.890> alright<00:02:04.890> thanks<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:05.880> watching
