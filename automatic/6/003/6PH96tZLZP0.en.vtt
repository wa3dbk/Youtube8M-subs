playing along with him you know he can

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
playing along with him you know he can
learn<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.310> from<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> young<00:01:36.060> lads

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
learn so much from like the young lads

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.179 
learn so much from like the young lads
in<00:01:36.540> myself<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.590> learn<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> lot<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:37.950> how

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
in myself we can learn a lot about how

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
in myself we can learn a lot about how
he<00:01:38.250> goes<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:38.520> doing<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.030> stuffing<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
he goes about doing this stuffing on and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
he goes about doing this stuffing on and
it'd<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.590> something<00:01:40.799> bad<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it'd be good something bad but I think I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.510 
it'd be good something bad but I think I
don't<00:01:42.210> think

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
don't think

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.460 
don't think
so<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.360> being<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.600> case<00:01:44.689> with<00:01:45.110> him<00:01:45.229> being

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
so that being the case with him being

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.810 
so that being the case with him being
away<00:01:45.649> does<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:45.979> put<00:01:46.130> more<00:01:46.250> pressure<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
away does that put more pressure on the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.219 
away does that put more pressure on the
other<00:01:46.939> bowlers<00:01:47.149> such<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:47.570> yourself<00:01:47.869> are<00:01:48.020> just

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
other bowlers such as yourself are just

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.280 
other bowlers such as yourself are just
the<00:01:48.320> left-hander's<00:01:48.670> not<00:01:49.670> really<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.360> I

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
the left-hander's not really have I

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.590 
the left-hander's not really have I
think<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.130> father<00:01:52.670> we<00:01:52.939> bother<00:01:53.149> with<00:01:53.420> that

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
think the father we bother with that

you know I mean we speak about every
single<00:02:24.739> year<00:02:24.920> I've<00:02:25.850> been<00:02:25.940> here<00:02:26.180> eight<00:02:26.299> nine

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
single year I've been here eight nine

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.759 
single year I've been here eight nine
years<00:02:26.750> now<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.049> that's<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> main

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
years now and that's that's the main

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.020 
years now and that's that's the main
question<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.250> always<00:02:28.370> comes<00:02:28.519> up<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.940> know

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
question that always comes up you know

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.030 
question that always comes up you know
and<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.569> think<00:02:30.170> sometimes<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.799> can<00:02:30.920> almost

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and I think sometimes you can almost

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.160 
and I think sometimes you can almost
almost<00:02:31.940> think<00:02:32.120> too<00:02:32.239> far<00:02:32.420> ahead<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.840> think<00:02:33.019> I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
almost think too far ahead and think I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.750 
almost think too far ahead and think I
want<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> trophy<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.010> want<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.519> down

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
want to trophy and want to do this down

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.789 
want to trophy and want to do this down
on<00:02:35.000> whatever<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.480> know<00:02:35.600> but<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:36.049> think<00:02:36.590> I've

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
on whatever you know but I think I've

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.020 
on whatever you know but I think I've
touched<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.250> before<00:02:37.340> if<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:37.730> think

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
touched on it before if you just think

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.340 
touched on it before if you just think
about<00:02:38.120> they're<00:02:38.299> here<00:02:38.480> now<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:39.110> what<00:02:39.260> you

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.620 
a result wiki of today we've got result
and<00:02:49.850> if<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.090> use<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:50.359> to<00:02:50.510> our<00:02:50.540> advantage

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
and if we use that to our advantage

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.270 
and if we use that to our advantage
flowed<00:02:51.350> there<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.890> know<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.220> I'm

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
flowed there so we know that I'm

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.440 
flowed there so we know that I'm
conditioning<00:02:52.579> better<00:02:52.940> than<00:02:53.120> any<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.329> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
conditioning better than any of the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.630 
conditioning better than any of the
carry<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.019> if<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.560> use<00:02:54.650> as<00:02:54.799> our<00:02:54.920> advantage<00:02:55.489> in

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.630 
carry and if you use as our advantage in
ball<00:02:56.739> we<00:02:57.739> know<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.980> boiling<00:02:58.130> condition<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
ball we know the boiling condition the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.310 
ball we know the boiling condition the
baton<00:02:58.880> finishing<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.420> we<00:02:59.570> can<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.810> put<00:03:00.049> plans

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
baton finishing so we can have put plans

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.870 
baton finishing so we can have put plans
to<00:03:00.560> some<00:03:01.010> sort<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.280> play<00:03:01.400> against<00:03:01.670> opposition

at<00:03:04.010> local<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.640> thought<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.269> think<00:03:05.359> we've<00:03:05.780> got<00:03:05.959> a

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
at local I thought I think we've got a

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.739 
at local I thought I think we've got a
really<00:03:06.170> good<00:03:06.320> chance<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.650> see
