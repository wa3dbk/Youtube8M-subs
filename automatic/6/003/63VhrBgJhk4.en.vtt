 and the world through the eyes of a bob cat I don't know how 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.530
 I know this session without these books because 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.540
 that they are losing me in the state 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.579
 balance and some kind of soul 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.010
 calm time like session me out 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.109
 this state of remarkable spilled out 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.600
 I already told about these books in 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.100
 one of your previous videos if you 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530

 advertises constantly 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.370
 and I catch myself thinking if I have 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.579
 there were no these books I you must them 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.740

 video book sergei gam leskovo nrzb 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.520
 I liked less than those books 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.320
 who read the previous semester but I 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.150
 I think that I knowingly paid attention to this 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.670
 a book that had not yet never 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.130
 questions that created the poet and she 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.770
 different from the prose that create 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.780
 writers have a different language in this book 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.600
 Sergey Galitsky felt that the author 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.490
 can work with language writers write 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.079
 I talked a little differently about 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.060
 this previous video 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.159
 this book is based on a story 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.990
 unrequited love and life in general 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.270
 failures man she will fly it by 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.189
 after 30 years and on the pages 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.640
 This book action takes place then in 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.619
 73 you need something under the twentieth century 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.439
 first of all the book is remembered bright 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.289
 characters and bright characters 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.840
 possible for all the characters in this book but 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.240
 I singled out for myself the poet Chekryshov 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 through which all destinies are built 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.060
 other heroes and respectively 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.670
 Main character 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.750
 Lion Krivorotov young there still 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.720
 hopes of the poet 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.810
 who have nothing in life 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.960
 fought the explosion the book is remembered language 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.100
 somewhere prose is very similar to 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.950
 poetic speech and this is unusual and this 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.570
 the reader probably catches me if I don’t 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.700
 decided to get philological 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.800
 education then i would never read 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.230
 This book because I did not know about this 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.180
 poetics are more active than english if you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.130
 want to get acquainted with our creativity 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 modern poets and writers then you 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.510
 can pay attention to this book 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.100
 also in the previous month I had time 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.940
 get acquainted with the book tatyana this 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.200
 resilience is dystopian fiction and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.480
 postapokalipsis I do not read such books and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 I was surprised that it was this book me 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.400
 interested but it's worth it 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.459
 this book takes place in the territory 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.890
 former russia which survived to nuclear 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.750
 a catastrophe i suppose the sterlets who 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.660
 survived the disaster scary 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.030
 boarding school and if they are not 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.840
 at the stage of development of an ancient person then 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.300
 they are stuck somewhere in the Middle Ages and hardly 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.180
 will I get out of this state because 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.459
 that new people who were born after 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.970
 disasters are worse than former people 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.519
 who survived the catastrophe I would describe 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.340
 all these people in one word hot 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.310
 somewhere this book resembles a work 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.440
 Ray Bradbury 451 degrees Fahrenheit 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.440
 Tatiana's thick book is also not held in high esteem 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.200
 and not read that kinky kept at home about 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.480
 her as bad and seemingly protagonist 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.430
 gives hope that all is not lost 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.530
 and reaches for enlightenment 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.720
 but in fact there all gentlemen 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.250
 really bad 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.590
 discharge book funny laughed a lot 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.390
 cattle met the main character 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.010
 this book Benedict Cumberbatch Is it you 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.230
 the further you read this book, the more you 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.470
 I understand more that there is little funny 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.989
 that here you need to cry because it is very 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.269
 many of the above than you think and 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.609
 it was difficult for me to read this book 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.109
 because it's fantastic i'm 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.109
 I practically don’t read 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.190
 at first glance it seems difficult 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.590
 language which is actually ingenious 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.729
 thought it over to the tongue makes you understand that 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.770
 everything is very, very bad with something like that 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.810
 I have already encountered on the pages of the book 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.780
 Sasha Falcon School for Fools 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.400
 first moment I am so shocking to you 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.900
 what you ca n't understand at all here 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.770
 happens and what the writer wants to get across 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.610
 before you from Sasha falcon I was sick 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.949
 head because i suffer syndrome 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.300
 searching for meaning any and hector i read 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.970
 just reading the words 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.669
 this sense is difficult to distinguish for example in 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.410
 book Sasha Falcon I considered 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.100
 text by him to try catch 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.139
 hectic so and because without preparation 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.120
 such books to read and very difficult 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.789
 Tatyana then we stand I was not circling 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.580
 head apparently after previous experience 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.470
 books if you want to know what is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.630
 attack attack from which attacked 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.850
 Russia can read a book there 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.979
 tatyana fat i think she don't you 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.930
 leave indifferent well and now about 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.900

 want to read and what book 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.820

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.639

 and if you don't know yet then I just 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.349
 master is not correct to put emphasis on 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.870
