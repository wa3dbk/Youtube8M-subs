00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
it to mend MSR to know you probably want

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.020 
it to mend MSR to know you probably want
to<00:03:09.440> change<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.829> heat<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.190> medium<00:03:10.220> medium-high

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030

of high boiling right just turn down the
temperature<00:03:15.290> right<00:03:15.620> now<00:03:15.739> because<00:03:16.040> we're<00:03:16.190> just

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
temperature right now because we're just

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.180 
temperature right now because we're just
melting<00:03:16.669> the<00:03:16.760> chocolate
