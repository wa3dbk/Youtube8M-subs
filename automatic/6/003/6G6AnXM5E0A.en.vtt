here's how we're going to use green

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.030 
here's how we're going to use green
painters<00:00:09.210> tape<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> fix<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.440> line<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.830> clock

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
painters tape to fix a line of clock

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.860 
painters tape to fix a line of clock
that<00:00:11.219> didn't<00:00:11.519> look<00:00:11.580> very<00:00:11.790> good<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.269> had<00:00:12.509> cut<00:00:12.750> it

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
that didn't look very good I had cut it

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
that didn't look very good I had cut it
out<00:00:12.990> before<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.500> then<00:00:13.620> painted<00:00:13.830> over<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
out before and then painted over it and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.860 
out before and then painted over it and
put<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.790> new<00:00:14.969> flooring<00:00:15.269> thinking<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> would

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
put in new flooring thinking it would

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.210 
put in new flooring thinking it would
look<00:00:15.990> good<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> still<00:00:16.740> didn't<00:00:16.949> look<00:00:17.010> as

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
look good but it still didn't look as

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099 
look good but it still didn't look as
clean<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.640> wanted<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.510> protect<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> new

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
clean as I wanted so to protect the new

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.500 
clean as I wanted so to protect the new
floor<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.500> put<00:00:19.710> down<00:00:19.890> some<00:00:20.279> painters<00:00:21.029> tape<00:00:21.090> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
floor we put down some painters tape and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.450 
floor we put down some painters tape and
we're<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> run<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> bead<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.070> caulk

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we're just going to run a bead of caulk

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.250 
we're just going to run a bead of caulk
along<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.359> tape<00:00:25.189> like<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.869> looks<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
along with tape like this and it looks a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.410 
along with tape like this and it looks a
little<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.619> messy<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.730> tape<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.240> give

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
little bit messy but the tape will give

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.569 
little bit messy but the tape will give
it<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> nice<00:00:30.810> clean<00:00:31.140> line<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> end<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.430> not

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it a nice clean line in the end I'm not

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.100 
it a nice clean line in the end I'm not
going<00:00:32.790> around<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> sides<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> sides

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
going around the sides because the sides

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
going around the sides because the sides
looked<00:00:34.410> okay<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.399> did<00:00:35.640> tape<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> sides

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
looked okay but I did tape the sides

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.869 
looked okay but I did tape the sides
just<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> protect<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.530> then<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.670> just

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
just to protect them so then you just

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
just to protect them so then you just
pull<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.510> finger<00:00:39.899> along<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.469> clock<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pull your finger along the clock and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.639 
pull your finger along the clock and
it's<00:00:42.390> always<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> little<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.350> crazy<00:00:44.390> how<00:00:45.390> much

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
it's always a little bit crazy how much

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.889 
it's always a little bit crazy how much
ends<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.739> being<00:00:47.070> extra<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.210> usually<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.660> do

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
ends up being extra it usually has to do

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.770 
ends up being extra it usually has to do
it<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> amount<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.760> opening<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> caulk

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it the amount of opening in the caulk

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.619 
it the amount of opening in the caulk
how<00:00:52.110> big<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.469> opening<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> gun<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.329> um

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
how big the opening is in the gun but um

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.250 
how big the opening is in the gun but um
are<00:00:55.399> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> tube<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
are in the tube but you can see I'm just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
are in the tube but you can see I'm just
smoothing<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.010> there's<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.489> absolutely

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
smoothing it and there's like absolutely

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.270 
smoothing it and there's like absolutely
no<00:01:00.449> method<00:01:00.930> other<00:01:01.109> than<00:01:01.289> trying<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
no method other than trying to make it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
no method other than trying to make it
look<00:01:03.320> nice<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> clean<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.500> then<00:01:07.520> once<00:01:08.520> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
look nice and clean and then once I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.899 
look nice and clean and then once I
think<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> looks<00:01:09.619> sort<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> uniform<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
think it looks sort of uniform and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
think it looks sort of uniform and
smooth<00:01:12.180> everywhere<00:01:12.689> I'm<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> peel<00:01:13.680> back
