so<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.470> thought<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.920> I'd<00:03:32.010> buy<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.730> then

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
so I thought that I'd buy this and then

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.180 
so I thought that I'd buy this and then
I'd<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> whole<00:03:33.629> collection<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.319> cute

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
I'd have like a whole collection of cute

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.900 
I'd have like a whole collection of cute
little<00:03:35.840> food<00:03:36.840> related<00:03:37.590> hamster<00:03:38.190> houses<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:38.879> I

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
little food related hamster houses so I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.280 
little food related hamster houses so I
went<00:03:39.090> ahead<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.390> bought<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:39.750> from<00:03:39.870> pets<00:03:40.140> at

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
went ahead and bought this from pets at

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.410 
went ahead and bought this from pets at
home<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:40.829> was<00:03:41.010> three<00:03:41.280> pound<00:03:41.519> 25<00:03:42.060> now<00:03:42.389> I

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
home and this was three pound 25 now I

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.699 
home and this was three pound 25 now I
thought<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.870> super<00:03:43.230> cheap<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
thought that was super cheap and I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.629 
thought that was super cheap and I
actually<00:03:43.829> thought<00:03:44.100> these<00:03:44.280> were<00:03:44.459> more

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
actually thought these were more

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.890 
actually thought these were more
expensive<00:03:44.819> hence<00:03:45.359> why<00:03:45.510> I've<00:03:45.569> never<00:03:45.600> bought

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
expensive hence why I've never bought

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.990 
expensive hence why I've never bought
one<00:03:45.959> before<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.400> going<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.700> be<00:03:47.819> for

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
one before so this is going to be for

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.629 
one before so this is going to be for
one<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.299> dwarfs<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.459> hopefully<00:03:50.459> they'll

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
one of the dwarfs and hopefully they'll

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.160 
one of the dwarfs and hopefully they'll
really<00:03:50.910> like<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.630> would<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> cute

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
really like it and it would be a cute

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.660 
really like it and it would be a cute
little<00:03:52.349> addition<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.889> their<00:03:53.010> cage<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.609> it

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
little addition to their cage and it

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.520 
little addition to their cage and it
will<00:03:53.790> add<00:03:54.030> more<00:03:54.389> color<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.780> things<00:03:55.139> for<00:03:55.410> them

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
will add more color and things for them

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.860 
will add more color and things for them

actually had to check with a member of
staff<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.709> make<00:04:13.829> sure<00:04:13.889> that<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> price<00:04:14.489> tag

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730

staff to make sure that the price tag
was<00:04:14.880> right<00:04:15.090> because<00:04:15.329> i<00:04:15.510> didn't<00:04:15.810> believe<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
was right because i didn't believe that

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.890 
was right because i didn't believe that
they<00:04:16.349> could<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.370> cheap<00:04:17.639> so<00:04:18.389> they<00:04:18.780> only

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
they could be that cheap so they only

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.810 
they could be that cheap so they only
had<00:04:19.109> two<00:04:19.320> left<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.829> i<00:04:19.859> went<00:04:20.070> ahead<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.340> bought

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
had two left and i went ahead and bought

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.850 
had two left and i went ahead and bought
both<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.299> them<00:04:21.479> just<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.049> i<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
both of them just so that i have a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.800 
both of them just so that i have a
couple<00:04:23.639> spared<00:04:23.910> because<00:04:24.090> i<00:04:24.210> have<00:04:24.389> a<00:04:24.419> couple

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
couple spared because i have a couple

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.200 
couple spared because i have a couple
already<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.349> humbug<00:04:26.220> likes<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.639> destroy<00:04:27.000> thee

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
already but humbug likes to destroy thee

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.430 
already but humbug likes to destroy thee
so<00:04:27.389> I<00:04:27.450> thought<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.840> would<00:04:27.990> get<00:04:28.139> them

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
so I thought that I would get them

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.379 
so I thought that I would get them
whilst<00:04:29.280> they<00:04:29.490> have<00:04:29.669> them<00:04:29.910> because<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.300> the

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
whilst they have them because of the

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.610 
whilst they have them because of the
woman<00:04:30.660> said<00:04:30.810> they<00:04:30.930> don't<00:04:31.050> really<00:04:31.229> come<00:04:31.470> into

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
woman said they don't really come into

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.710 
woman said they don't really come into
stock<00:04:31.889> that<00:04:32.099> often<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.090> went<00:04:33.240> ahead<00:04:33.330> and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
stock that often so I went ahead and

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.779 
stock that often so I went ahead and
bought<00:04:33.930> two<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.139> those<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.770> they<00:04:34.950> were<00:04:35.130> 75

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
bought two of those and they were 75

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.629 
bought two of those and they were 75
peach<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.289> next<00:04:37.470> two<00:04:37.680> items<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:38.160> picked<00:04:38.430> up

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
peach so the next two items I picked up

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.330 
peach so the next two items I picked up
with<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.240> packet<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.260> pick<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.770> mix<00:04:40.950> treats

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
with a packet of the pick and mix treats

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.339 
with a packet of the pick and mix treats
so<00:04:41.910> I've<00:04:42.060> never<00:04:42.240> tried<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.690> pick<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> mix<00:04:43.139> range

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
so I've never tried to pick a mix range

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.020 
so I've never tried to pick a mix range
before<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:43.919> thought<00:04:44.099> I'd<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.520> ahead<00:04:44.789> and

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
before so I thought I'd go ahead and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.870 
before so I thought I'd go ahead and
give<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.599> go<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.860> first<00:04:47.039> bag<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.580> picked

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
give it a go so the first bag I picked

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.350 
give it a go so the first bag I picked
up<00:04:48.090> was<00:04:48.680> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360

these wedges and the other bag I picked

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.379 
these wedges and the other bag I picked
up<00:04:53.210> was<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:54.139> speckled<00:04:54.860> rolls<00:04:55.099> now<00:04:55.969> these<00:04:56.180> are

and they're just northeast in it so I

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.100 
and they're just northeast in it so I
thought<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.120> I've<00:05:38.360> tried<00:05:38.599> something<00:05:39.020> a

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
thought that I've tried something a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.360 
thought that I've tried something a
little<00:05:39.229> bit<00:05:39.469> different<00:05:39.830> once<00:05:39.949> we<00:05:40.039> finish<00:05:40.279> a

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
little bit different once we finish a

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.269 
little bit different once we finish a
hairy<00:05:40.520> hamster<00:05:40.939> so<00:05:41.750> I've<00:05:42.319> had<00:05:42.710> this<00:05:42.889> for<00:05:42.949> all

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
hairy hamster so I've had this for all

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.769 
hairy hamster so I've had this for all
my<00:05:43.430> daughter<00:05:43.699> hamsters<00:05:44.090> in<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.270> past<00:05:44.509> and

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
my daughter hamsters in the past and

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.629 
my daughter hamsters in the past and
they<00:05:44.840> absolutely<00:05:45.229> loved<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:45.800> so<00:05:46.370> I<00:05:46.400> thought

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
they absolutely loved it so I thought

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.339 
they absolutely loved it so I thought
that<00:05:46.879> I'd<00:05:46.969> go<00:05:47.150> ahead<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.419> try<00:05:47.930> this<00:05:47.960> with<00:05:48.229> the

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
that I'd go ahead and try this with the

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.980 
that I'd go ahead and try this with the
dwarf<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:48.979> it<00:05:49.099> contains<00:05:49.460> mainly<00:05:50.150> seeds<00:05:50.629> which

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
dwarf so it contains mainly seeds which

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.570 
dwarf so it contains mainly seeds which
dwarf<00:05:51.259> hamsters<00:05:51.710> really<00:05:51.949> liked<00:05:52.159> and<00:05:52.370> it<00:05:52.460> also

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
dwarf hamsters really liked and it also

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.309 
dwarf hamsters really liked and it also
contains<00:05:53.000> meal<00:05:53.270> worms<00:05:53.569> as<00:05:53.779> well<00:05:53.930> for<00:05:54.110> added

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
contains meal worms as well for added

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.559 
contains meal worms as well for added
protein<00:05:54.529> so<00:05:55.490> I<00:05:55.789> thought<00:05:55.940> I'd<00:05:56.150> go<00:05:56.300> ahead<00:05:56.449> and

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
protein so I thought I'd go ahead and

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.180 
protein so I thought I'd go ahead and
try<00:05:56.779> this<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.199> see<00:05:57.259> what<00:05:57.319> the<00:05:57.560> dwarf<00:05:57.800> hamsters

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
think of this and this was three pounds

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.329 
think of this and this was three pounds
