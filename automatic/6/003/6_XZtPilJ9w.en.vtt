that's<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.210> classic<00:01:51.890> recipe<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that's a that's a classic recipe for a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
that's a that's a classic recipe for a
family<00:01:53.579> fight<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.140> their<00:01:55.290> joint

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
family fight and then their joint

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.410 
family fight and then their joint
accounts<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.310> guess<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.820> set<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.210> when

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
accounts I guess these are set up when

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020 
accounts I guess these are set up when
maybe<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.930> parent<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.100> both<00:01:59.159> parents<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.850> ill

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
maybe one parent or both parents are ill

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.020 
maybe one parent or both parents are ill
and<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:01.110> child<00:02:01.649> test<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.040> pay<00:02:02.219> bills<00:02:02.460> expenses

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and a child test then pay bills expenses

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.010 
and a child test then pay bills expenses
that<00:02:03.149> kind<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.689> set<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that kind of thing so they set up a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.209 
that kind of thing so they set up a
joint<00:02:04.170> account<00:02:04.320> exactly<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
joint account exactly and then the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
joint account exactly and then the
question<00:02:05.520> becomes<00:02:05.729> what<00:02:06.180> did<00:02:06.329> mom<00:02:06.509> really

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
question becomes what did mom really

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.719 
question becomes what did mom really
mean<00:02:07.110> when<00:02:07.350> she<00:02:07.500> set<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:07.920> did<00:02:08.459> she<00:02:08.489> mean

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
mean when she set that up did she mean

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.250 
mean when she set that up did she mean
it<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> gift<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.720> pass<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.530> mum

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
it to be a gift to pass when mum

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.170 
it to be a gift to pass when mum
to<00:02:11.470> go<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.799> child<00:02:12.129> or<00:02:12.340> did<00:02:12.819> she<00:02:12.849> just<00:02:13.060> do

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
to go to that child or did she just do

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.910 
to go to that child or did she just do
it<00:02:13.209> for<00:02:13.420> convenience<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.019> make<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.590> easier<00:02:14.860> for

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
it for convenience to make it easier for

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.130 
it for convenience to make it easier for
mom<00:02:15.189> to<00:02:15.310> pay<00:02:15.459> bills<00:02:15.700> inside<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.019> it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
mom to pay bills inside and and then it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
mom to pay bills inside and and then it
becomes<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.470> question<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.829> whether<00:02:18.099> that<00:02:18.250> asset

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
becomes a question is whether that asset

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.699 
becomes a question is whether that asset
should<00:02:18.879> go<00:02:19.120> back<00:02:19.299> into<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.689> estate<00:02:19.989> or<00:02:20.409> to

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
should go back into the estate or to

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.740 
should go back into the estate or to
that<00:02:20.860> child<00:02:21.159> its<00:02:21.459> intent<00:02:21.819> right<00:02:22.180> exactly

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that child its intent right exactly

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.460 
that child its intent right exactly
exactly

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
exactly

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.800 
exactly
executive<00:02:24.280> conflicts<00:02:24.849> yeah<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.569> any

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
executive conflicts yeah do you have any

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.330 
executive conflicts yeah do you have any
requests<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.290> were<00:02:26.379> talking<00:02:26.769> about<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.220> know

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
requests you were talking about you know

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.850 
requests you were talking about you know
kids<00:02:27.670> playing<00:02:28.659> their<00:02:28.900> roles

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
kids playing their roles

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.770 
kids playing their roles
is<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.459> any<00:02:30.610> recourse<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.269> can<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.569> taken

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
is there any recourse that can be taken

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
is there any recourse that can be taken
if<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.560> sibling<00:02:32.799> feels<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.579> another

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
if a sibling feels that another

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.059 
if a sibling feels that another
shouldn't<00:02:34.360> be<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> executive<00:02:34.959> yeah<00:02:35.590> they<00:02:35.829> can

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
shouldn't be the executive yeah they can

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.559 
shouldn't be the executive yeah they can
I<00:02:36.099> mean<00:02:36.250> there's<00:02:36.700> they're<00:02:37.120> costly

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
I mean there's they're costly

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.509 
I mean there's they're costly
proceedings<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:38.620> what<00:02:38.829> really<00:02:39.040> happens

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
proceedings but what really happens

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.059 
proceedings but what really happens
typically<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:41.079> children

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
typically is that that children

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.949 
typically is that that children
challenged<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> authority<00:02:43.329> of<00:02:43.420> another<00:02:43.540> so

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
challenged the authority of another so

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.869 
challenged the authority of another so
if<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.530> controlling<00:02:45.190> child<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
if the controlling child is in the

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.819 
if the controlling child is in the
executor<00:02:46.690> those<00:02:46.870> other<00:02:47.109> children<00:02:47.530> who<00:02:47.650> feel

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
executor those other children who feel

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.460 
executor those other children who feel
excluded<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.849> take<00:02:49.120> legal<00:02:49.750> challenge<00:02:50.260> maybe

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
excluded will take legal challenge maybe

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.899 
excluded will take legal challenge maybe
maybe<00:02:50.799> legal<00:02:51.190> challenges<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.639> will<00:02:51.790> make

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
maybe legal challenges but will make

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.879 
maybe legal challenges but will make
that<00:02:52.120> life<00:02:52.359> of<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.690> executor<00:02:53.260> difficult<00:02:53.709> and

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
that life of that executor difficult and

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.949 
that life of that executor difficult and
asking<00:02:54.220> questions<00:02:54.250> being<00:02:55.060> suspicious<00:02:55.690> things

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
asking questions being suspicious things

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.080 
asking questions being suspicious things
like<00:02:56.109> that<00:02:56.319> what<00:02:56.829> about<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.310> updating<00:02:57.909> of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
like that what about the updating of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.420 
like that what about the updating of
wills<00:02:58.599> people<00:02:59.409> you<00:02:59.769> know<00:02:59.889> have<00:03:00.099> their<00:03:00.250> wills

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
wills people you know have their wills

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.430 
wills people you know have their wills
done<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.030> circumstances<00:03:01.840> change<00:03:02.200> they

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
done and then circumstances change they

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.259 
done and then circumstances change they
may<00:03:02.560> have<00:03:02.709> kids<00:03:03.010> for<00:03:03.220> example<00:03:03.340> things<00:03:04.060> like

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
may have kids for example things like

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.879 
may have kids for example things like
that<00:03:04.480> yeah<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.139> mean<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.530> important

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
that yeah I mean it's important

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.319 
that yeah I mean it's important
obviously<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.489> will<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.879> living<00:03:07.209> document

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
obviously the will is a living document

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.750 
obviously the will is a living document
in<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.139> sense<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> change<00:03:09.609> it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
in the sense that you have to change it

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.460 
in the sense that you have to change it
and<00:03:10.090> it's<00:03:10.299> circumstances<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.170> cause<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
and it's circumstances that cause a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.649 
and it's circumstances that cause a
state<00:03:11.889> fight<00:03:12.159> so<00:03:12.430> when<00:03:12.940> when<00:03:13.239> circumstances

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
state fight so when when circumstances

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.720 
state fight so when when circumstances
change<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.950> will<00:03:15.129> doesn't<00:03:15.400> reflect

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
change and the will doesn't reflect

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.280 
change and the will doesn't reflect
those<00:03:16.000> circumstances<00:03:16.660> that's<00:03:16.989> when<00:03:17.199> we

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
those circumstances that's when we

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.170 
those circumstances that's when we
really<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.680> into<00:03:17.829> big<00:03:18.370> battles<00:03:18.790> most

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
really get into big battles most

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.759 
really get into big battles most

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
I mean $80,000 is that outside of the

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.460 
I mean $80,000 is that outside of the
mortgage<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:55.480> not<00:03:55.659> outside<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.139> mortgage

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
but the problem lies in the fact that

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.149 
but the problem lies in the fact that
only<00:03:58.419> three<00:03:58.810> years<00:03:59.019> ago<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.349> number<00:03:59.650> was<00:03:59.769> 69
