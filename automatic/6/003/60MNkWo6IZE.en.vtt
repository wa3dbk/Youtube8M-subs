00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
our other products step drag and most

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
our other products step drag and most
most<00:01:26.549> people<00:01:26.900> find<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> works<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.360> now

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
most people find it works there so now

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
most people find it works there so now
so<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.290> guys<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.920> two

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
so now you guys are going to have two

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
so now you guys are going to have two
versions<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> am<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> l

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
versions that you have the am and the l

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.710 
versions that you have the am and the l
so<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> M<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.590> old<00:01:35.250> ace<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
so the M is the old ace and now this is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.880 
so the M is the old ace and now this is
the<00:01:36.869> bigger<00:01:37.530> version<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> yes<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.630> ASM<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the bigger version of it yes the ASM is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.520 
the bigger version of it yes the ASM is
still<00:01:41.280> available<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.960> successful

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
still available and we very successful

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
still available and we very successful
that<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.640> main<00:01:44.820> difference<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that has the main difference is the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.440 
that has the main difference is the
tripod<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.500> aluminum<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.880> payload

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
tripod which is aluminum and the payload

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.980 
tripod which is aluminum and the payload
which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.780> about<00:01:48.960> 9<00:01:49.170> pounds<00:01:49.460> otherwise

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
which is about 9 pounds otherwise

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.969 
which is about 9 pounds otherwise
functionally<00:01:51.990> looks<00:01:52.229> pretty<00:01:52.500> much<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> same

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
functionally looks pretty much the same

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.850 
functionally looks pretty much the same
same<00:01:53.280> type<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> drag<00:01:53.790> system<00:01:54.180> same<00:01:54.450> type<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
same type of drag system same type of

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.039 
same type of drag system same type of
