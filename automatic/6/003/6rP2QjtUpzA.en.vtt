getting<00:00:25.710> burned<00:00:25.920> brilliant<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
getting burned brilliant this is a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
getting burned brilliant this is a
successful<00:00:27.990> technique<00:00:31.070> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.399> but

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
successful technique which is so but

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
successful technique which is so but
that<00:00:32.759> doesn't<00:00:33.120> seem<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> help<00:00:33.540> anybody<00:00:33.899> also<00:00:34.680> I

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
Britain perhaps an even more tangible

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300 
Britain perhaps an even more tangible
way<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> role<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> Muslims<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

anybody as long as those people are
peaceful<00:01:25.409> loving<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.979> don't<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.790> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
peaceful loving I don't think that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
peaceful loving I don't think that
there's<00:01:27.180> anything<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.750> Islamic<00:01:28.259> faith<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's anything in Islamic faith that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.090 
there's anything in Islamic faith that
predisposes<00:01:30.210> people<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.290> Awards<00:01:31.799> acts<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
predisposes people to Awards acts of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770 
predisposes people to Awards acts of
violence<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.119> people<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> know

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
violence and the people that I know

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
violence and the people that I know
they're<00:01:34.049> mostly<00:01:34.320> McCool<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.280> fact<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.000> not

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
they're mostly McCool in fact it's not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
they're mostly McCool in fact it's not
that's<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.840> deciding<00:01:37.590> factor<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that's not the deciding factor and I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.630 
that's not the deciding factor and I
