00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello I want to explain how to get the 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.440
 material of two siren videos that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 I have here youtube so I do not have to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.790
 answer more questions you can 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.920
 believe the story that I'm going to tell you or 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 you can not believe you anything 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
 it looks good I'm the first one that barely 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.030
 he believes in nothing he sees here in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.640
 Youtube 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.410
 but well this is what happened I went to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 the great barrier reef in 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.540
 australia which is where I live to try a 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.090
 underwater box to film under the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.790
 water that he had bought and the movie 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.110
 the left was my first attempt or be 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.840
 I am already answering many 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.550
 questions this is my material stop 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.250
 copy it this is not from any movie 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 no television show and this is 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.330
 the bottom of the ocean 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.590
 not very deep but it is not even an aquarium 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.440
 neither a pool nor anyone's bathtub 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.760
 good return to history had just 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.720
 get down there and I'm trying 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.840
 operate a camera from outside through 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.750
 from the box and I suddenly feel something 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.050
 behind me and at that moment I see 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.920
 pass this 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.330
 and I found out I thought it was that but 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 before I knew it, I had already 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 gone 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.660
 I have written 100 times here that the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 visibility that I had then there 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.710
 it was much worse than what I appreciate now 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 in the images or because in a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 I chased that is what asks a lot 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.160
 people at the time is because because I do not even 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.860
 I found out and because if you are 50 years old 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.020
 but you ditch very well or not the very good 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.680
 swimmer and you get into the bottom of the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.940
 ocean with a camera and a box let's go 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.580
 as if it were a vacuum cleaner and the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.010
 oxygen cylinder you're not for 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.930
 chase fish or be sorry 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.640
 disappoint or if not to see introduce 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 here an action movie but this what 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.700
 waths up 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.130
 I did not realize what I had 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.950
 filmed until at night I saw the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.530
 images on my computer on the laptop 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 so I went back the next day to the same 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 place almost exactly at the same 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.700
 place and I waited and waited and this time 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.160
 He had been there quite a while when 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 soon life and there are people a lot of people 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.819
 who says no if it seems that 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.709
 you were waiting for it to appear 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.420
 He was waiting but he did not know if he was going 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.940
 to appear or not 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.990
 but it has appeared and this time I could see it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.960
 perfectly and I shit my legs down 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.740
 and I stayed filming filming and tilt 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.630
 the camera as much as I could and then 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.430
 when I wanted to turn around and move 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.190
 the whole thing had disappeared 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.860
 as if by magic 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.780
 that's why I think it's a siren because 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.700
 is that he was and suddenly he was not there and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.040
 besides, like someone could have me 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.160
 spent a joke once but twice 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.380
 consecutive 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.330
 things that people comment on these 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.550
 videos this light at this time I do not know 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.950
 what seems to me to be the reflection of the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.950
 sun over a fish but I do not have an idea 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:17.040
 this other moment she doubles the 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 knees is what people write here 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.130
 Well yes there are legs 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.880
 It seems to me that if yes bend 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.490
 knees and other things 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.010
 but well that may be I do not know what 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.410
 better is the water distortion because 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.870
 I am 67 meters deep 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.160
 I know if you've ever been with a bottle 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.470
 but if you are at the bottom of the sea and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.270
 you look towards the surface it seems that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.970
 it's the same 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.650
 but I do not know that everyone thinks what 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.780
 I want what I do know is that I do not 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.090
 I have no idea of â€‹â€‹sirens nor am I a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.090
 specialist in costumes or effects 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.760
 special nothing of that but good you 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.060
 Do you think what you think of me? 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.160
 it looks good 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.190
 because I believe now that it is a 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.730
 mermaid good for something that nobody has 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.830
 commented here three million visits 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.830
 between these two videos and nobody has 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.250
 commented on the tail the tail of these 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.310
 Two mermaids is not the same I've seen 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.030
 this material more than anyone that sure and 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.800
 look at the tails is that it is not the same 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.900
 They are not the same 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.490
 that's why I think these are a group of 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:36.440
 animals or mermaids that were traveling 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.280
 towards the north towards the tropic and 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.199
 they were there in a moment and then 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.940
 they disappeared because after 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.090
 second day I had to go home and 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.949
 when I really realized the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.159
 material that I had filmed I organized another 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.520
 I traveled a month later and I came back and I was 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.750
 four times more in the same area and not 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.110
 I saw nothing 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:03.440
 that is they were and disappeared and that 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.440
 that's it
