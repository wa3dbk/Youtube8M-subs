00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.490
 a lot of people ask 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.490
 everything is made truck battery and engine assembly 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.550
 we are today only in the assembly line of mercedes-benz engines 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.519
 who is facetime fan hamas the corinthians 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519
 he's a Corinthian, we're going to do what not everyone is perfect 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.029
 assembly line was even quieter 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.179
 sought suit 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.720
 the captain by action 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.189
 a truck and the bus 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.359
 the heavy engine 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.400
 keeping up on the attack its three years it will change it 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.720
 Now, who does not use it for us? 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.790
 explains to us to go to the staff as he is grandson of sarney in the production 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.420
 of engines 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.370
 as 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.270
 the truck itself has not thought in the south that main line that we 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.170
 we have here 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.860
 from that part begins with the entrance of the body we already have a group that makes the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.100
 shirt assembly 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.620
 this theft it will start today 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.540
 riding the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 her card and in the sequence he puts it 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.530
 then recorded that he does the editing here 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.560
 where the positioning of the mechanical apposition of the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.050
 the valve control 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.080
 and here in this post made the recording of the engine number too and that's what goes 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.820
 ensure that the truck driver that his truck has a motor- 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.120
 originally seven of them 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.040
 in this stage that we are now putting here is a carcass of davis and luisÃ£o 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.040
 and the clutch assembly the steering wheel assembly 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 and in this line we passed several different types of motors then each one 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.260
 assembler refers that the whole he knows 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.910
 In any country, every motorcycle is doing the assembly in the sequence that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.870
 is made the will of the front wheel 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.190
 and here we will put the pistons and the alley of the motor-rone made 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.890
 another day that has also been placed with people 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 pump crude oil already placed will close the poster 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.990
 only that it is done all a check in the 'engine' will check that everything that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.170
 It's in there, I've got a portal, an error that controls these 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.070
 the dimensional parties are all tight right 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.590
 good touch the child loses part of the world is closed already and we start 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 mounting of the top peripherals have 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.350
 exactly the one that is made to a rotation of the motor 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.619
 and then he will put in the cart that will lead hypothesis at the end 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.839
 from now on now to mount all the peripherals of the rain by placing here 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.049
 the oil filter count in the head collector turbine 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:17.919
 willing to death 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.389
 Here we are going to make the valve adjustment of the engine to 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.109
 adjustment by an automatic machine that guarantees the accuracy of the 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.069
 regulation of the new the trucker has to worry there in the future 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.459
 check out the low occurrence sequence of your team play to prevent it from falling 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.779
 dirt dust the things of what was above to put the star of the hands 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.239
 and will make the connections from the water and fuel of the vehicle 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:44.829
 in the engine and the next step is already the 100% supply of the engines 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.430
 produced by the suspects 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.229
 pass the test 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:52.849
 aquino flores and the bike is not released do not go forward scholars wings 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.139
 fishing stocks have approved 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.979
 all driver after tested mounted part of them are selected 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:59.989
 randomly 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.569
 event this room disassemble it completely is the goal is to check 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.159
 if the driver has everything from engineering specifications 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.069
 the most obvious differential here we manufacture our own parts and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.689
 engines in engines 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.199
 this quality guarantee would not be enough for the ships here 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.719
 now we have modern machines and 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.159
 counter-order so that we but we guarantee the requirements of 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.939
 draw and product warranty for men
