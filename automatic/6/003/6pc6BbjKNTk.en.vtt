00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 the staff do not know if you know but I 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 I have already been invited to present our 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.940
 channel in several places institutes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.800
 here in CearÃ¡ and the places to 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 represent our channel account 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 story if he and I think that was the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.100
 the second time I was invited to a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.590
 where is too much 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.119
 so who does not know how to see the channel is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 growing and I'm going to invest in this channel 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.710

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.360
 very interesting for you that is a 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.150
 place where you can find 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.740

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.479

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.729
 this personal practice may even be 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.350
 impressed that I'm going to show 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.630
 but this is an app I get the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.590
 games and shows a channel for everyone 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.590

 being half my gives sim is sponsoring guy 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.159

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.869
 application really does what you want 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.750

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.180
