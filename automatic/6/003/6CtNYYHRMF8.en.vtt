Wi-Fi hotspot and a lot of stuff so

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.860 
Wi-Fi hotspot and a lot of stuff so
let's<00:00:38.230> activate<00:00:38.770> our<00:00:39.070> bionic<00:00:39.820> eye<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.300> see<00:00:40.570> how

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
let's activate our bionic eye to see how

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.440 
let's activate our bionic eye to see how
its<00:00:41.050> look<00:00:41.290> like

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.220 

so<00:00:44.900> here<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:46.700> can<00:00:47.270> see<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.780> the

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
so here it is you can see that the

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.370 
so here it is you can see that the
nearest<00:00:49.130> subway<00:00:49.370> here<00:00:49.790> are<00:00:50.300> located<00:00:50.870> with<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
nearest subway here are located with the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.580 
nearest subway here are located with the
lines<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:51.890> I<00:00:52.820> can<00:00:53.090> turn<00:00:53.330> around<00:00:53.720> and<00:00:54.260> see

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
lines and I can turn around and see

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.520 
lines and I can turn around and see
other<00:00:55.130> coffee<00:00:56.090> shops<00:00:56.450> restaurants<00:00:56.810> quest

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
other coffee shops restaurants quest

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.350 
other coffee shops restaurants quest
foods<00:00:57.860> around

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.350 

everything<00:01:02.290> is<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.190> red<00:01:03.340> time<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.059> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
everything is in the red time so the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.140 
everything is in the red time so the
distance<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.140> position<00:01:06.070> are<00:01:06.280> calculated

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
distance and the position are calculated

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.200 
distance and the position are calculated
in<00:01:07.810> real<00:01:08.110> time<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.650> if<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.070> move<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:09.550> work<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.180> a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
in real time so if I move I work to a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.020 
in real time so if I move I work to a
station<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.950> distance<00:01:12.340> will<00:01:12.520> be<00:01:12.550> just

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
station the distance will be just

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.750 
station the distance will be just
updated

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.630 

so<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.780> other<00:01:20.930> thing<00:01:21.050> is<00:01:21.380> when<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.400> put<00:01:22.610> your

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
so the other thing is when you put your

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.620 
so the other thing is when you put your
icon<00:01:23.540> down<00:01:23.720> like<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.340> will<00:01:26.030> get<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.270> list

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
icon down like that you will get a list

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.770 
icon down like that you will get a list
of<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.230> different<00:01:27.790> neural<00:01:28.790> base<00:01:28.940> stations

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
of the different neural base stations

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.460 
of the different neural base stations
and<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.220> point<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.310> interest<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.570> subway

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
and the point of interest so the subway

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.160 
and the point of interest so the subway
stations<00:01:33.890> are<00:01:34.100> here<00:01:34.370> with<00:01:35.300> different<00:01:35.930> lines

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
stations are here with different lines

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.100 
stations are here with different lines
you<00:01:36.410> can<00:01:36.440> take

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
you can take

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.370 
you can take
so<00:01:38.710> let's<00:01:39.160> say<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.310> want<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.700> grab<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.910> coffee<00:01:40.380> the
