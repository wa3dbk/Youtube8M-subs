 what is for fashion 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 is more than criticizing those guys who are

 fuck for me that's not rap it's about 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 to make poetry and leave a good message 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.370
 of supporting each other to make this 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.010

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.880
 disputes with government and society is the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.640
 simple reality and it's called revolution 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.470

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.039
 motto is that step my brother want 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.619
 say something just say what happens is that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.630
 I have a daring friend it's about 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.530
 a microphone that is responsible for screaming what 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.319
 what do i say 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
 I 'm not kidding and I'm still in this culture 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.599
 where I always witnessed as minds 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.099
 cold have sought to vent with 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.470
 different alternatives to overcome 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.780
 the years have passed and I have wetted many 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 bathrooms my fucking writing has healed me of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.280
 as much damage as hate envy the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.530
 guilt and longing for that I have my 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.750
 pen at close range I do not deny it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.670
 life is sweet and at the same time rancid 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.519
 thankfully I met a lot of 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.739
 my dear childhood ink dear paper 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.560
 convince the inspiration that never 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.600
 leave me alive protects a desired charm 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.640
 which is derived from my letters collides and a 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.620
 rusty thought open mind in the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.080
 sense of opinion you know that each 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.140
 song has its interval of reflection 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.360
 I do not lie and less in my culture, not the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.750
