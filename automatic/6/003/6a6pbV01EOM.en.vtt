let's<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.869> asked

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.149 

watch<00:01:55.119> gosh<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:56.170> can<00:01:56.320> see<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.649> takes<00:01:56.829> a<00:01:57.009> little

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
watch gosh you can see it takes a little

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.740 
watch gosh you can see it takes a little
while<00:01:57.399> fair<00:01:57.759> all<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.090> rocks<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.539> stuff

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
while fair all the rocks and stuff

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.469 
while fair all the rocks and stuff
kalawa<00:01:59.109> that's<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.460> only<00:02:00.609> has<00:02:00.700> HD

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
kalawa that's because it only has HD

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.010 
kalawa that's because it only has HD
processors<00:02:02.319> if<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.280> were<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.520> go<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.020> 4650

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
processors if you were to go in the 4650

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.809 
processors if you were to go in the 4650
you'd<00:02:05.530> have<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.890> upgrade<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.399> power<00:02:06.609> supply

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
you'd have to upgrade the power supply

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.490 
you'd have to upgrade the power supply
and<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:08.259> has<00:02:08.410> 320<00:02:09.280> stream<00:02:09.580> processors<00:02:10.500> unless

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
and it has 320 stream processors unless

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
and it has 320 stream processors unless
you<00:02:11.680> want<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.950> feel<00:02:12.160> comfortable<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.970> might<00:02:13.180> as

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
you want to feel comfortable I might as

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.920 
you want to feel comfortable I might as
well<00:02:13.480> go<00:02:13.780> ahead<00:02:14.489> forty-eight<00:02:15.810> 48<00:02:16.810> seven<00:02:18.930> but

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
well go ahead forty-eight 48 seven but

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.690 
well go ahead forty-eight 48 seven but
at<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:24.390> medium<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.569> myself<00:02:26.160> with<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.459> white

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
at you medium and myself with a white

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.069 
at you medium and myself with a white
box<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.569> chop<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:31.480> how<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:31.690> doing

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
box is going to chop see how we doing

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.630 
box is going to chop see how we doing
this<00:02:32.200> little<00:02:32.500> cutscene<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.099> here<00:02:33.340> cuz<00:02:33.519> it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
this little cutscene up here cuz it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.729 
this little cutscene up here cuz it
might<00:02:33.849> choke<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.959> down<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.170> little<00:02:35.380> bit<00:02:35.590> it

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
might choke it down a little bit it

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.979 
might choke it down a little bit it
might<00:02:35.920> not<00:02:36.099> i<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:37.060> plugged<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.450> into<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.720> TV

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
might not i just plugged it into the TV

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.539 
might not i just plugged it into the TV
so<00:02:38.500> let's<00:02:39.489> say<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.700> see<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.390> get<00:02:41.280> 1280<00:02:42.280> by

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
so let's say we see we can get 1280 by

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.160 
so let's say we see we can get 1280 by
720<00:02:43.440> alright<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.360> frame<00:02:46.629> rates<00:02:46.900> light

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
720 alright see if the frame rates light

00:02:47.170 --> 00:03:03.150 
720 alright see if the frame rates light
not<00:02:48.040> too<00:02:48.310> bad<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:50.170> gonna<00:02:50.379> put<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.739> around<00:02:54.420> 2025

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.570 

hear<00:03:04.160> that

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.030 

we'll<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.390> when<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.660> vaporize<00:03:08.200> them<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.830> it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
we'll see when you vaporize them if it

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.210 
we'll see when you vaporize them if it
chokes<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.580> little<00:03:09.730> bit<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:11.220> wouldn't

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
chokes it a little bit I wouldn't

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.220 
chokes it a little bit I wouldn't
attempt<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.020> with<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.560> stock<00:03:15.190> on<00:03:15.490> board

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
attempt this with the stock on board

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:40.290 
attempt this with the stock on board
nvidia<00:03:19.020> graphics<00:03:20.020> card<00:03:24.030> like

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.229 

right

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.330 

when<00:03:48.239> he<00:03:48.360> vaporizes<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.200> we'll<00:03:49.379> see<00:03:49.650> what<00:03:50.159> the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
when he vaporizes and we'll see what the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.119 
when he vaporizes and we'll see what the
frame<00:03:50.580> rate<00:03:50.790> turns<00:03:51.060> into<00:03:51.269> here<00:03:52.049> at<00:03:52.140> Smith<00:03:52.500> no<00:03:52.830> I

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
frame rate turns into here at Smith no I

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.740 
frame rate turns into here at Smith no I
don't<00:03:53.819> think<00:03:53.909> we're<00:03:54.209> alone<00:03:54.420> out<00:03:54.659> here

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.479 

negative<00:03:57.750> sir<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.530> got<00:03:58.680> four<00:03:58.890> dead<00:03:59.099> Corinne

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
