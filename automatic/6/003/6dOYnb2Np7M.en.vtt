00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
short version and this is a broad brush

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
short version and this is a broad brush
stroke<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.299> there's<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:21.960> some

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
stroke so there's going to be some

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
stroke so there's going to be some
details<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.580> left<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> could

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
details on the left out that you could

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
details on the left out that you could
argue<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.290> basically<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> fiat

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
argue about but basically you have fiat

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
argue about but basically you have fiat
currency<00:01:26.790> chaos<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> gold<00:01:27.900> standard

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
currency chaos going to gold standard

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
currency chaos going to gold standard

stability off the gold standard chaos go

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
stability off the gold standard chaos go
back<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> gold<00:01:31.290> standard<00:01:31.350> ability<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.220> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
back on a gold standard ability and on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
back on a gold standard ability and on
and<00:01:32.490> off<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.610> goes<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:33.420> again<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> broad

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and off it goes and that's again a broad

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.039 
and off it goes and that's again a broad
brush<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.310> he's<00:01:35.490> suggesting<00:01:36.090> we're<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.540> chaos

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
brush so he's suggesting we're in chaos

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
brush so he's suggesting we're in chaos
are<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.530> toward<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.130> chaos<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.939> then

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
are going toward more chaos and then

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
are going toward more chaos and then
we'll<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.360> forced<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.110> gold<00:01:40.439> standard

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
we'll be forced on to gold standard

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.950 
we'll be forced on to gold standard
again<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.880> sure<00:01:41.909> certainly<00:01:42.840> that's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
again I'm not so sure certainly that's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
again I'm not so sure certainly that's
in<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.530> history<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.250> past<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:45.030> thing

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
in the history in the past one thing

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.340
