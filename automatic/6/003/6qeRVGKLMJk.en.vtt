frequency but at the same time we can
learn<00:02:02.759> from<00:02:03.049> everything<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.320> what

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
learn from everything and that's what

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.280 
all kinds of things different for me and
I<00:02:18.430> feel<00:02:18.819> that's<00:02:19.090> what<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.110> key

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
I feel that's what that's the key

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.050 
I feel that's what that's the key
because<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.739> lot<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.069> us<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.400> only<00:02:21.610> want<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
because a lot of us we only want to

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.039 
because a lot of us we only want to
communicate<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:23.230> people<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> same

totally different from us and a lot of
the<00:02:40.209> times<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:40.629> have<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.989> allow<00:02:41.349> ourselves<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
the times we have to allow ourselves to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.220 
the times we have to allow ourselves to
flow<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.579> be<00:02:43.299> connected<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:43.930> person

different<00:02:48.040> views<00:02:48.579> from<00:02:48.909> us<00:02:49.060> because<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:50.560> this

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
different views from us because in this

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.069 
different views from us because in this
world<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.120> separated<00:02:52.810> ourselves

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
religion all of these things and for me

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.170 
religion all of these things and for me
when<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.959> realized<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.829> so<00:03:00.459> many<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.849> us<00:03:00.970> in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
when I realized that so many of us in

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.979 
when I realized that so many of us in
this<00:03:01.299> society<00:03:01.900> are<00:03:02.730> alone<00:03:03.730> even<00:03:04.569> though<00:03:04.840> we

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
this society are alone even though we

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.140 
this society are alone even though we
have<00:03:05.319> all<00:03:05.349> of<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.769> fancy<00:03:06.069> technology<00:03:06.939> and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
have all of this fancy technology and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.849 
have all of this fancy technology and
all<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.299> these<00:03:07.540> things<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.079> still<00:03:08.349> many

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
all of these things but still many

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.289 
all of these things but still many
people<00:03:09.310> are<00:03:09.400> living<00:03:09.609> in<00:03:09.849> isolation<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:12.299> for

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
people are living in isolation and for

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.149 
people are living in isolation and for

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
me what I've come to realize is that the

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.539 
me what I've come to realize is that the
universe<00:03:15.609> always<00:03:15.909> send<00:03:16.389> someone<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:18.340> have

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
universe always send someone and we have

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.319 
universe always send someone and we have
to<00:03:18.760> always<00:03:18.940> be<00:03:20.639> free<00:03:21.639> we<00:03:21.819> have<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:22.120> leave<00:03:22.299> that

to always be free we have to leave that
open<00:03:22.810> space<00:03:23.739> because<00:03:23.949> a<00:03:24.160> lot<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.400> us<00:03:24.639> we<00:03:24.849> close

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
open space because a lot of us we close

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.509 
open space because a lot of us we close
our<00:03:25.540> hearts<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:26.290> say<00:03:26.470> okay<00:03:26.769> enough<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.340> these
