we've<00:03:59.310> pre-drilled<00:03:59.819> our<00:03:59.940> holes<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.510> the

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
we've pre-drilled our holes for the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.180 
we've pre-drilled our holes for the
mounting<00:04:00.629> screws<00:04:01.229> and<00:04:01.440> we've<00:04:01.530> talked<00:04:01.829> inside

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
mounting screws and we've talked inside

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.189 
mounting screws and we've talked inside
so<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.519> have<00:04:02.639> a<00:04:02.669> lot<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:02.909> silicone<00:04:03.359> going<00:04:03.870> into

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
so we have a lot of silicone going into

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.869 
so we have a lot of silicone going into
the<00:04:04.349> threads<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:04.829> we<00:04:04.919> seal<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.280> screws<00:04:05.699> as

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
the threads so we seal the screws as

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.530 
the threads so we seal the screws as
