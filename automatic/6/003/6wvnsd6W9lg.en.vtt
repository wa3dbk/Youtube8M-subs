well<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.470> escalating<00:00:07.950> solutions<00:00:08.429> here<00:00:08.639> we've

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
well at escalating solutions here we've

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.700 
well at escalating solutions here we've
got<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> very<00:00:09.269> exciting<00:00:09.389> product<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
got a very exciting product for the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.610 
got a very exciting product for the
concrete<00:00:11.099> guys<00:00:11.450> this<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.630> our<00:00:12.809> 10<00:00:13.170> foot<00:00:13.440> wide

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
concrete guys this is our 10 foot wide

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.910 
concrete guys this is our 10 foot wide
come<00:00:14.009> along<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.719> set<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> bobcat

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
come along and it's set up on a bobcat

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
come along and it's set up on a bobcat
here<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.970> makes<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> very<00:00:18.359> easy<00:00:18.779> for

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
here and it just makes it very easy for

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.810 
here and it just makes it very easy for
you<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> grade<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.770> sub<00:00:20.039> grades<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.699> your

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you to grade your sub grades for your

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.779 
you to grade your sub grades for your
concrete<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.050> pull<00:00:22.199> large<00:00:22.500> amounts<00:00:23.010> very

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
concrete and to pull large amounts very

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.200 
concrete and to pull large amounts very
flat<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> very<00:00:24.539> smoothly<00:00:25.849> they're<00:00:26.849> using<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
flat and very smoothly they're using the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
flat and very smoothly they're using the
idiqs<00:00:27.630> system<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
idiqs system on this one right here to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.569 
idiqs system on this one right here to
demonstrate<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> find<00:00:30.900> great<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
demonstrate how to find great but the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
demonstrate how to find great but the
difference<00:00:32.910> between<00:00:33.000> our<00:00:33.300> come-alongs<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
difference between our come-alongs and a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.440 
difference between our come-alongs and a
regular<00:00:34.410> come-along<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.730> we've<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
regular come-along so we've got the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.350 
regular come-along so we've got the
plate<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> back<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.829> hinged<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
plate on the back that's hinged this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.260 
plate on the back that's hinged this
plate<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.050> low<00:00:40.230> ground<00:00:40.620> pressure<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
plate is for low ground pressure and the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.580 
plate is for low ground pressure and the
hinge<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> operator<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
hinge is so that the operator has a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.319 
hinge is so that the operator has a
little<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.129> flexibility<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.149> he's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
little bit of flexibility as he's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.290 
little bit of flexibility as he's
following<00:00:45.899> grade<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.550> hinge<00:00:47.760> makes<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
following grade the hinge makes it so

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
following grade the hinge makes it so
you<00:00:48.390> can't<00:00:48.690> sink<00:00:49.050> down<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> cut<00:00:50.190> chunks<00:00:50.489> out

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you can't sink down and cut chunks out

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
you can't sink down and cut chunks out
of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> ground<00:00:57.829> one<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> nice<00:00:59.100> things

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
of the ground one of the nice things

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
of the ground one of the nice things
about<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.879> come<00:01:00.059> along<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> track<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
about to come along on the track out is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
about to come along on the track out is
that<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> move<00:01:02.489> huge<00:01:02.969> amounts<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that you can move huge amounts of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.750 
that you can move huge amounts of
material<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.559> way<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:04.739> pull<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> with

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
material out of your way or pull it with

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.510 
material out of your way or pull it with
you<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.299> grade<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> case<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.369> can

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you as you grade so in this case you can

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.330 
you as you grade so in this case you can
see<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> amount<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> material<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:11.010> he's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
see the amount of material that as he's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
see the amount of material that as he's
starting<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.700> put<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.150> grade<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:13.500> he<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
starting to put it on grade that he just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.520 
starting to put it on grade that he just
strikes<00:01:14.159> freely<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.909> easily<00:01:15.420> without<00:01:15.540> ten

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
smooth even grade here's a really good
example<00:01:43.530> where<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.520> he's<00:01:45.299> just

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
example where you can see it he's just

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
example where you can see it he's just
pulling<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> whole<00:01:46.049> mountain<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pulling the whole mountain they just

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
pulling the whole mountain they just
came<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.549> took<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> truck<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> dumped<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
came in and took a truck and dumped a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
came in and took a truck and dumped a
load<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.220> started<00:01:50.729> wanting

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
load in here and I just started wanting

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
load in here and I just started wanting
to<00:01:51.149> work<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> other

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.350 

one<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.920> the<00:01:59.980> great<00:02:00.160> advantages<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:01.240> can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
one of the great advantages is you can

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.750 
one of the great advantages is you can
just<00:02:01.570> take<00:02:01.750> one<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.140> your<00:02:02.290> laborers<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.580> go

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
just take one of your laborers and go

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.940
