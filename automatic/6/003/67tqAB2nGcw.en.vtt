00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
possibly the sixth time now and yeah why

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.910 
possibly the sixth time now and yeah why
I<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> find<00:00:25.260> them<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:25.800> fine<00:00:26.160> um

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.750 
but it's the fact that okay that sucks I
just<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.430> put<00:00:32.579> only<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.270> man<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
just I put only just man up and it's the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
just I put only just man up and it's the
fact<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.559> it's<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> random<00:00:38.430> event<00:00:38.579> um<00:00:39.020> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
fact that it's like a random event um in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.319 
fact that it's like a random event um in
a<00:00:40.770> certain<00:00:41.100> place<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.879> always<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
a certain place so it's always in the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
a certain place so it's always in the
same<00:00:42.450> place<00:00:42.629> place<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> random<00:00:43.620> event<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
same place place just a random event in

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
same place place just a random event in
the<00:00:44.040> random<00:00:44.370> event<00:00:44.640> does<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.149> happen<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.050> I've

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the random event does not happen so I've

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.720 
the random event does not happen so I've
been<00:00:46.770> trying<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> figure<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.340> ways<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
been trying to figure out ways to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.209 
been trying to figure out ways to
trigger<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.239> think<00:00:48.510> I've<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.840> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

right out back to a critique City and
just<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.430> good<00:03:35.550> measure

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970

somewhere else or just go to a different
sea<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.570> then<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.810> back<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.450> give<00:03:45.600> it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
sea and then go back just to give it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.890 
sea and then go back just to give it
chance<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.290> reset<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.010> then<00:03:47.910> go<00:03:48.209> back<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.600> and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
chance to reset and then go back in and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.110 
chance to reset and then go back in and
let's<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.590> if<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:50.100> worked<00:03:50.519> hopefully<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:50.970> does

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
let's see if it worked hopefully it does

in<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.160> event<00:06:00.460> when<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:01.090> do<00:06:01.470> leave<00:06:02.470> and<00:06:02.650> come

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
in the event when I do leave and come

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.530 
in the event when I do leave and come
back<00:06:02.890> again<00:06:03.070> so<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:06.490> is<00:06:06.810> ideal<00:06:07.810> you<00:06:08.490> guys

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
back again so I that is ideal you guys

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.280 
back again so I that is ideal you guys
which<00:06:10.540> means<00:06:10.570> you<00:06:10.840> don't<00:06:10.990> have<00:06:11.080> to<00:06:11.170> keep

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
which means you don't have to keep

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.600 
which means you don't have to keep
experiment<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:11.980> like<00:06:12.130> I<00:06:12.280> had<00:06:12.370> to<00:06:12.460> do<00:06:12.580> for

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
experiment and like I had to do for

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.140 
experiment and like I had to do for
about<00:06:13.030> an<00:06:13.210> hour<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:14.050> two<00:06:14.200> hours<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:15.640> think<00:06:16.030> it's

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
about an hour to two hours I think it's

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.300 
about an hour to two hours I think it's
taken<00:06:16.390> me<00:06:16.450> two<00:06:16.690> days<00:06:16.840> to<00:06:17.110> record<00:06:17.590> this<00:06:17.800> one

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
taken me two days to record this one

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.350 
taken me two days to record this one
episode<00:06:18.610> that's<00:06:18.730> why<00:06:18.820> I<00:06:18.850> haven't<00:06:18.970> uploaded

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
episode that's why I haven't uploaded

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.540 
episode that's why I haven't uploaded
because<00:06:20.260> I<00:06:20.530> really<00:06:20.740> want<00:06:20.860> to<00:06:20.890> get<00:06:21.010> it<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.430> I

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
because I really want to get it that I

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.150 
because I really want to get it that I
get<00:06:21.850> it<00:06:21.970> done<00:06:22.120> so<00:06:22.660> know<00:06:22.810> what<00:06:23.080> but<00:06:23.950> I<00:06:23.980> just

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
get it done so know what but I just

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.560 
get it done so know what but I just
don't<00:06:24.250> know<00:06:24.370> when<00:06:24.580> I<00:06:24.610> was<00:06:24.760> gonna<00:06:24.880> work<00:06:25.090> for<00:06:25.390> me

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
don't know when I was gonna work for me

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.980 
don't know when I was gonna work for me
so<00:06:26.470> hopefully<00:06:27.040> this<00:06:27.490> doesn't<00:06:27.760> pose<00:06:28.240> up<00:06:28.660> for<00:06:28.900> me

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990
