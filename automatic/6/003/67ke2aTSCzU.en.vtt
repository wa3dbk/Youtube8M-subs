00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.200
 we less what do you think about hockey 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.620
 turned out 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.160
 I think that in such sports palaces when 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 such conditions 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.780
 strange to show any probably 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.189
 peace of hockey but my opinion is that the match 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.580
 turned out deduce often kept 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:28.689
 chicago stresses to last 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.970
 on your team quotes say then 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.739
 that we all made together for what 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.590
 prepare walk on depends on 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.540
 what time of day what opponent is not 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.850
 comes out to play whatever they are 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.660
 in any case will not be able to play matches 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.180
 Now that I think what has been done there 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.790
 at least for now but they are responsible 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:55.690
 in the game we played I think that is right 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.320
 control of the game by execution is understandable 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.320
 that mistakes happen 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.229
 34 outcome is logical 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.240
 and generally give a moment to our rivals 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.580
 were in our rival's gate 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:17.110
 moments a lot of your overclocking 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:23.010
 this great 44 logical result is not 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.010
 add when the guy stayed on the five 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.920
 the first system is hypothetical if 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.730
 should we be among the butt 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.870
 1 year 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.760
 the game I have already asked such a question of the mountains 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.880
 created it came in that here's an eye 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.680
 two striker likes and expressiveness 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 which opens many create moments 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.170
 somewhere collect better brewers dressed 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.430
 there we are not their soul any match but I 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.100
 happens add 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.410
 so probably like have a team 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.920
 other players and not use and not 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.880
 play them and maybe even 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.459
 free from some kind of defensive 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.350
 due to the fact that a large number 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.870
 attacks and start these players 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.530
 it would be wrong the rest of the bazaar 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.850
 Sergey Obukhov 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.850
 building their minutes on you
