00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 yes, here he speaks again your burkhard 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.189
 I'm here on the map was 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.769
 on road 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.610
 I drive the tea 750 heavy tank like that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.920
 name already says it's a cockpit 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 correspondingly heavy battle tank that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.400
 Here is a standard battle 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.400
 and 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.640
 the tea 750 has a car charging system when 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.160
 When he finishes loading he has four 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.070
 grenades after 120 you very fast 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.380
 history can not be more expensive 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 would 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:46.300
 1951 to 57 c been developed 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.690
 with 120 and a 155 mm cannon 1957 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.879
 america set up the project with the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.449
 nuclear statement would not be 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.400
 promising nothing for her 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.589
 and so you can use it as a pure passport 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.589
 or ups panzer 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.550
 but that should not bother us, yes 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.530
 It's fun and fun 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:14.500
 not bad wargaming by wargaming 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.290
 would be maintained by him or says about him 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.220
 a supporter speak second row armor 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.930
 I can confirm 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.380
 at first you should be with him 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.380
 calm 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 stay second row 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.840
 artemis card knowledge teacher is or the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.670
 China is struck hard and then 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.549
 off to the front 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.860
 then beat the opponent's ball that 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:48.290
 manko so nice magazine stock or car 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.509
 Unfortunately, too, is just to start when 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.450
 many are on the map on the way 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.950
 are the loading times there you are 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.950
 because a little bit more going on 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:12.819
 yes that 's a lot on the way 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.700
 and comes down from the mountain 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.840
 maybe we can still like her 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.040
 helping defend and enemies 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 I just wanted to look forward to the page 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.310
 say 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.210
 turned off because in the first row 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.510
 I did not really want to be with him 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.140
 not right at the beginning 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.190
 mentioned already says second row 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.020
 I confirm knowing snipers 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.020
 distance make my shares empty 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 the appearance is as long as possible 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.319
 stay as many as possible in the game 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.060
 raushauen magazine 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.880
 then you do your hurt and 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.930
 Damage means points and also that one 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.420
 maybe there will win a mix 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.420
 50p I have blind ones out there 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.560
 and because I'm far enough from the here 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.910
 tree and possible other guys 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.489
 He does not even stand there for me 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.360
 recognized sayings are not even the 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.360
 been spotted 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.750
 control on the mx 50 b 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.540
 tja 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.330
 what I have done to the match now 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.330
 have that after an evaluation 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.650
 because I shot some leg here 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:02.080
 put down yes I take now the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.670
 I just wanted to say repair kit 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.670
 the stars on 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.590
 and as we have times try to 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.709
 help 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.750
 users slowly do not break 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.750
 So there is nothing helped 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.800
 it stops then it rages then 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.800
 over and then everything is ready 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:45.530
 I almost could not help it 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:49.190
 No one is a member of the crowd 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.700
 hey babe is yes then I will ts 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.700
 nudged 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.270
 that has just scared me 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.360
 at the wake up 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.640
 but like that, one is in clan man 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.580
 has a plan to live that too 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.260
 a small duty with us in ts 1 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.000
 I have indeed mute but if 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.520
 one is then teased then then comes 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.420
 but the message goes off speak 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:29.430
 but well that's over me 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.500
 must say the t 57 harry has his 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.950
 Advantages thanks to auto charging system so if 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.740
 you do not rush senselessly straight forward 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.150
 and place like a mayfly then 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.000
 you do harm to him and too 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.830
 Battles do not even go bad 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.140
 and superior as a badge third 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.720
 It would have been great now 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:55.590
 effective and bat yes shot 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:01.320
 12 direct hits 12 of them 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:04.860
 Eleven effects hits 3289 made on 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.560
 About 300 meters distance 1085 was 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.780
 so it goes on sometimes 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.730
 Removing some blind protection I have 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.450
 they have to hit me too 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.050
 have 12 shots so can go well with 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.480
 hit the blue shorts 2 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.390
 one did not break through one 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.070
 armor repelled or many of the 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.660
 damage by armor repelled 750 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.680
 So no small caliber that off on her 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:37.170
 bounced against discovered a five-opponent 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:43.260
 damaged three destroyed by damage 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:45.630
 player support 499 then primary 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.220
 account because I only standard here 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.710
 Ammunition shot did not have gold 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:54.070
 ammo has 30,600 here 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:58.810
 Then have 890 credit points net profit 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:01.060
 me if I have no primary or hardly 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:06.820
 would you have a nice profit of 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:10.260
 14 1978 credits net profit easy 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.600
 fighting and so I come to 1230 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.430
 experience points and I now 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.420
 played because he is again 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:22.240
 has been desired and was now and then 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.710
 complete wish if it fits but me 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.190
 can not constantly buy new tanks 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.880
 or constantly the same tank 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.250
 play 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:35.260
 I have to check it once in a while 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:36.970
 show a little bit of variation yes that should 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.890
 it had actually been already 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:42.310
 I really wish you with the t 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:49.120
 750 heavy tank a lot of fun the row there 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:50.380
 with the t 69 and the t 54 49 auto lade 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.050
 I can not get it right now 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:56.020
 I believe the 54 clock 1 or 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:59.170
 sowa does not nail me there if 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.800
 not because what confused me 

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:05.040
 check 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:08.050
 but only these 10 69 deep 54 the 750 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:12.130
 I think I have already succeeded 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:14.740
 and very good so absolutely playing 

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:19.080
 find value series or vehicle type 

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.080
 I have been the wood
