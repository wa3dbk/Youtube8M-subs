00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 music is that he is multi and takes 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.150
 some dairy ingredient that gives you that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 creamier texture the front not the monkfish 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
 it's ice mixed with its ingredients 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.000
 So, well, this time it's going 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 to be frappé and well then the English 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.400
 what do you think if you take note because we are going 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 to see them it seems frappé we are going to need 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.710
 two cups of orange juice 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.110
 two cups of carrot juice 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 a quarter cup of lemon juice 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.460
 ice the amount needed 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.130
 and sugar to taste the truth is that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.950
 it's also a dessert that they will feel what 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.330
 sweet of the dessert we want but a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.190
 much healthier dessert 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.720
 currently also lady is at home 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 that many times we do not know how to give 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.870
 vegetables and vitamins to children 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.420
 so you have to take advantage of many 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.660
 sometimes the desserts to include the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.700
 fruits or vegetables and well then be 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 of those of its ingredients is a dessert 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.330
 rich and attractive for children like this is 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.670
 that this post and truth is that to me 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.050
 It seems very good, well, of course 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.060
 very nutritious because carrot 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 very many beta carotene very many 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
 terrific vitamin c for sight by 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.540
 supposedly great to avoid the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 gripas and in addition to everything great as 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.060
 anticarcinogenic and especially lung 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.220
 that's how it is, well, this little game of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 carrot let's put it here in the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.290
 excellent blender combination with juice 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 of orange also a lot of vitamin c 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 and antioxidants so we 're going to put 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.520
 that carrot juice a little juice 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.980
 of lemon to reinforce our game and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.960
 give the flavor 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.360
 to the taste of each one will add the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 sugar that you want and that you like every 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.750
 who knows his family that of the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 tastes if that sugar can be 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 substitute for sugar in case that 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.220
 want to use sugar substitute 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.490
 to lower all the calories of this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.620
 I'm going to add normal sugar 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.800
 refined sugar and let's put here 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.890
 also ice to give that texture and 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.890
 that thickness to the frappe that to everything 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.420
 world we like not many ice because 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.650
 Well of course the more and the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.630
 add more more water will drop the 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.610
 ice and more flavor is going to lose nods 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.790
 eye with that nothing else I will put here 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.520
 little by little here says some blenders 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.770
 they say crochet ice that means 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.560
 well, let's go biting the ice 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.330
 or grinding the ice and that's what I 'm going 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.910
 to tighten 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.160
 It is done 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.650
 on the ice but I do not want to be 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.390
 remove all that texture from the ice that 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.190
 high thickness of the ice so that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.160
 let's leave it like this and practically 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.590
 is ready let's now pour this 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.390
 I frappé in our glasses and with this we 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.410
 we go straight to our 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.820
 presentation to see how it is 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.380

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.500
