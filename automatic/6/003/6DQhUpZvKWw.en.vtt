Hi, I will now show you how to iron 
a shirt

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.640
You must first see what kind of 
material it is made of.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.360
This shirt is made out of cotton.
As you can see from the label.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.870
Now we can set the right temperature 
for ironing this type of material

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.160
The iron is ready for use when the 
little light turns off.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.520
We start by ironing the collar.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.010
Next up, are the arms.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240
Now it's important that you don't rush things.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.070
Beginn with the cufflinks

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.930
I don't find it necessary to iron both the outside
and the inside.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.470
But that's up to you.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.190
Again, don't be hasty.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.120
Make sure the lines of stitches
are on top of each other.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.830
So that the fabric doesn't fold up.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:17.640
Make sure to move the iron around,
so that you can get into all the folds, 
like from the cufflinks.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.510
I tend to iron out the sholders 
along with the arms.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.660
So I line up the stitches here as well.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:37.130
But, if you prefer, you can also pull that 
part of the shirt on to the rounded end
of the board. 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.610
And iron it out.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.880
This gives an easy reach while I simply
move the shirt along.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.130
Take the midsection, and then the 
other side.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.560
So now I didn't have to line up the stitches.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.190
And now we've moved on to the other arm.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.470
Now we repeat what we just did
with the first one.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.880
Remember, work out the folds around
the cuffs.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:32.530
Take your time and give a 
precursor brush with your hands.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.720
Turn the iron so that it alway points
in the direction your working.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.620
And now we begin with the torso.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.350
I put the top one side on the board
and start ironing.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.910
Remember the areas between the buttons.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.160
It is important that along with the right
temperature, it also has the right 
humidity.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.650
The regulation of this is luckily easy
with modern steam-based irons.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:04:03.570
Seeing as we already did the sholders,
we'll start straight with the back.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.780
Then I simply work downwards.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:20.160
Go over any potential folds that show up. 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.010
Now we've finished with the back, 
and are almost finished.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.940
Now we've reached the front.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:19.760
Work out the bottom, 
and move along the button holes.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:30.250
 When you've reached the top, work 
down from the shoulder towards the pocket.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:39.180
Work towards the collar, and remember, this is
a very visible part of the shirt. 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:52.710
Now your'e finished and can either
put it on, or use a clothes hanger.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:03.630
Or if you don't have the space, 
you can simply fold it.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.730
Close every other button.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:23.630
Grab the sholders and turn the shirt,
while keeping everything lined up.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:34.630
Then you fold one side at a time, 
keeping everything smooth.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.470
Now you're finished with your first shirt.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.570
You're welcome.
