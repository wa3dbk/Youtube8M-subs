00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.350 

I<00:00:15.379> was<00:00:16.379> attracted<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:16.890> Emily<00:00:17.280> Carr<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
I was attracted to Emily Carr because of

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.690 
I was attracted to Emily Carr because of
the<00:00:18.960> good<00:00:19.320> reputation<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> school<00:00:20.520> has

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
the good reputation that the school has

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.450 
the good reputation that the school has
but<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.090> more<00:00:21.600> because<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.710> integration

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
but also more because of the integration

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.970 
but also more because of the integration
between<00:00:23.640> theory<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.689> research<00:00:24.869> well<00:00:25.740> first

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
between theory and research well first

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.290 
between theory and research well first
of<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> really<00:00:26.490> liked<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.880> Cooper's<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
of all I really liked on Cooper's the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.179 
of all I really liked on Cooper's the
city<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.259> awesome<00:00:28.860> place<00:00:29.009> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
city I think it's an awesome place to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
city I think it's an awesome place to
live

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
live

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
live
it<00:00:31.230> reminded<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.860> lot<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.940> smaller

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it reminded me a lot of the smaller

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.770 
it reminded me a lot of the smaller
private<00:00:33.780> schools<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.410> state<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.540> lot

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
private schools in the state but a lot

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.549 
private schools in the state but a lot
more<00:00:36.810> approachable<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.900> affordable<00:00:39.900> okay<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
more approachable and affordable okay I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
more approachable and affordable okay I
think<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> faculty<00:00:41.250> members<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.059> very

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
think the faculty members are very

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.990 
think the faculty members are very
supportive<00:00:42.770> they<00:00:43.770> challenged<00:00:44.309> students<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
supportive they challenged students and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.200 
supportive they challenged students and
encouraged<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:46.080> to<00:00:46.410> explore<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.790> out<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
encouraged us to explore and get out of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.020 
encouraged us to explore and get out of
our<00:00:48.449> comfort<00:00:48.840> zones<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:50.400> also<00:00:50.580> just<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
our comfort zones I think also just the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.799 
our comfort zones I think also just the
exposure<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> other<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.590> students<00:00:53.809> has

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
exposure to the other other students has

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.180 
exposure to the other other students has
been<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.170> amazing<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.739> far<00:00:55.949> like

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
been really amazing so far like

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.650 
been really amazing so far like
everybody<00:00:56.580> comes<00:00:56.820> from<00:00:56.910> such<00:00:57.239> widely

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
everybody comes from such widely

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740 
everybody comes from such widely
different<00:00:58.140> backgrounds<00:00:58.769> but<00:00:59.610> all<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
different backgrounds but all the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.509 
different backgrounds but all the
reference<00:01:01.080> sharing<00:01:01.470> is<00:01:01.589> really<00:01:01.890> starting<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
reference sharing is really starting to

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.790 
reference sharing is really starting to
kick<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.390> build<00:01:04.199> early<00:01:04.440> rich

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
kick in and like build early rich

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.090 
kick in and like build early rich
context<00:01:05.489> I've<00:01:05.640> started<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.560> question<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
context I've started to question the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.290 
context I've started to question the
origins<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.060> artistic<00:01:09.630> upbringing<00:01:10.289> and

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
origins of my artistic upbringing and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.660 
origins of my artistic upbringing and
critique<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.660> structures<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> systems<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
critique the structures and systems and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.109 
critique the structures and systems and
movements<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.610> was<00:01:17.610> working<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
movements that I was working in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.389 
movements that I was working in
previously<00:01:18.930> when<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.410> was<00:01:19.619> looking<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.070> grad

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
previously when I was looking at grad

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.910 
previously when I was looking at grad
schools<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.330> looked<00:01:21.690> at<00:01:21.899> a<00:01:21.930> number<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
schools I looked at a number of them and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
schools I looked at a number of them and
something<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> made<00:01:24.539> some<00:01:24.990> schools<00:01:25.440> much

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
something that made some schools much

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
something that made some schools much
more<00:01:25.920> appealing<00:01:26.130> than<00:01:26.280> others<00:01:26.640> was<00:01:27.060> having

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
more appealing than others was having

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.910 
more appealing than others was having
non<00:01:28.740> media<00:01:29.430> specific<00:01:30.259> programs<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.680> fact

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
non media specific programs the fact

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.779 
non media specific programs the fact
that<00:01:32.390> we<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.890> designated<00:01:34.890> painters<00:01:35.369> or

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
that we are not designated painters or

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.830 
that we are not designated painters or
sculptors<00:01:35.899> or<00:01:36.899> dryers<00:01:37.319> or<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.479> just

that would take a sort of a broad
