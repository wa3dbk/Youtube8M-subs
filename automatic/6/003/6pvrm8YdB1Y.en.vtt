allowed<00:02:02.170> us<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.590> like<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.890> velvet<00:02:03.280> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
allowed us and like the velvet the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.340 
allowed us and like the velvet the
strong<00:02:03.970> friendship<00:02:04.479> just<00:02:04.810> from<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.020> start

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
strong friendship just from the start

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.469 
strong friendship just from the start
with<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.710> fact<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.100> we've<00:02:06.460> been<00:02:06.970> through<00:02:07.330> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
with the fact that we've been through it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.660 
with the fact that we've been through it
like<00:02:07.720> we've<00:02:08.020> both<00:02:08.170> been<00:02:08.229> or<00:02:08.739> we<00:02:09.250> know<00:02:09.489> what

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
like we've both been or we know what

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.180 
like we've both been or we know what
it's<00:02:09.819> like<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.149> kind<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.950> pressure

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
it's like to kind of have the pressure

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.690 
it's like to kind of have the pressure
of<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.610> country<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.069> not<00:02:15.550> necessarily

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
of a country you know not necessarily

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.280 
of a country you know not necessarily
all<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.540> back<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:16.959> that's<00:02:17.080> what<00:02:17.260> it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
all on your back but that's what it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.160 
all on your back but that's what it
feels<00:02:17.470> like<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.739> time<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:19.209> then<00:02:19.239> also<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:20.140> only

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
feels like a time and then also not only

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.440 
feels like a time and then also not only
that<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:20.950> also<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.280> build<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.180> like

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
that but it's also to build it to like

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590 
that but it's also to build it to like
really<00:02:23.290> really<00:02:23.470> struggle<00:02:24.300> while<00:02:25.300> that's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
really really struggle while that's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.840 
really really struggle while that's
going<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.739> basically<00:02:26.920> yet<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.700> not

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
going on in to like basically yet to not

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.240 
going on in to like basically yet to not
be<00:02:27.970> playing<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.830> know<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.070> flip
