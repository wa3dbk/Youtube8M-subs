shelter<00:02:05.020> he<00:02:05.110> was<00:02:05.230> moving<00:02:05.470> fast<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.860> wasn't

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
shelter he was moving fast I wasn't

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.890 
shelter he was moving fast I wasn't
fully<00:02:06.280> aim<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.700> gun<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:06.970> amazingly<00:02:07.690> accurate

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
fully aim the gun is amazingly accurate

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.950 
fully aim the gun is amazingly accurate
at<00:02:08.580> six<00:02:09.580> times<00:02:09.910> seven<00:02:10.179> times<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.720> ten<00:02:10.929> that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
at six times seven times out of ten that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.980 
at six times seven times out of ten that
would<00:02:11.260> have<00:02:11.350> missed<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.460> now<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.870> I'm

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
would have missed so now here I'm

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.220 
would have missed so now here I'm
thinking<00:02:17.020> well<00:02:17.860> sir<00:02:18.820> an<00:02:19.360> awful<00:02:19.810> lot<00:02:19.990> going

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
thinking well sir an awful lot going

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.750 
thinking well sir an awful lot going
down<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.530> flank<00:02:20.830> they're<00:02:21.100> pretty<00:02:21.400> tired<00:02:21.640> up

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
down this flank they're pretty tired up

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.240 
down this flank they're pretty tired up
on<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> other<00:02:22.120> side<00:02:22.530> that's<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.650> big<00:02:23.920> artillery

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
on the other side that's a big artillery

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.010 
on the other side that's a big artillery
in<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.670> game<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.540> don't<00:02:25.720> want<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.930> go

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
in the game I really don't want to go

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.170 
in the game I really don't want to go
down<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.320> road<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.650> these<00:02:26.800> flank<00:02:27.340> that's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
down the road on these flank that's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.580 
down the road on these flank that's
basically<00:02:28.480> where<00:02:28.660> heavy<00:02:28.810> tanks<00:02:29.110> go<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> get

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
basically where heavy tanks go to get

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.320 
basically where heavy tanks go to get
killed<00:02:29.800> by<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.340> them<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> figured<00:02:32.620> well<00:02:33.210> if<00:02:34.210> I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
killed by to them so I figured well if I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.730 
killed by to them so I figured well if I
get<00:02:34.540> killed<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.990> not<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> massive<00:02:35.470> loss<00:02:35.620> to

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
get killed it's not a massive loss to

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.130 
get killed it's not a massive loss to
the<00:02:35.830> team<00:02:36.040> my<00:02:36.220> man<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:37.000> let's<00:02:37.660> head<00:02:37.810> down<00:02:37.959> here

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
the team my man is let's head down here

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.800 
the team my man is let's head down here
and<00:02:38.230> see<00:02:38.350> we<00:02:38.470> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:40.300> in<00:02:40.570> have<00:02:40.690> been<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
and see we can see and I in have been a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.210 
and see we can see and I in have been a
bit<00:02:40.989> indecisive<00:02:41.380> here<00:02:41.830> push<00:02:42.790> forward<00:02:43.270> on

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
bit indecisive here push forward on

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.530 
bit indecisive here push forward on
maybe<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.280> should<00:02:45.400> help<00:02:45.550> defend<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.970> middle<00:02:46.270> I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
maybe I should help defend the middle I

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.510 
maybe I should help defend the middle I
don't<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:46.930> what<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.650> am<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> nard

not want to come face to face with it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.770 
not want to come face to face with it
but<00:03:11.270> there's<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> t43<00:03:11.990> up<00:03:12.080> there<00:03:12.260> all<00:03:12.410> alone

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
but there's a t43 up there all alone

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.090 
but there's a t43 up there all alone
should<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.870> abandon<00:03:15.020> him<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.530> his<00:03:15.650> fate

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
should I abandon him to his fate

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.880 
should I abandon him to his fate
oh<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.780> there's<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.990> third<00:03:18.170> name<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.650> least

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
oh and there's a third name the least

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.890 
oh and there's a third name the least
one<00:03:19.160> Ferdinand<00:03:19.700> behind<00:03:20.030> them<00:03:20.180> are<00:03:20.360> what's

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
one Ferdinand behind them are what's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.590 
one Ferdinand behind them are what's
going<00:03:20.960> on<00:03:21.260> here

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
going on here

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.450 
going on here
so<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.900> figure<00:03:24.320> will<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> t43<00:03:24.860> is<00:03:25.100> back<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.370> up

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
so I figure will the t43 is back it up

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.000 
so I figure will the t43 is back it up
maybe<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.180> as<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.480> tiger<00:03:26.840> too<00:03:26.990> as<00:03:27.140> well<00:03:27.290> I'm

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
maybe on as a tiger too as well I'm

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.450 
maybe on as a tiger too as well I'm
doomed

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
doomed

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.790 
doomed
but<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.540> t43<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.080> backing<00:03:30.350> up<00:03:30.440> because<00:03:30.560> it's

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
but the t43 is backing up because it's

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.520 
but the t43 is backing up because it's
not<00:03:30.830> stupid<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:32.570> figure<00:03:32.840> well<00:03:32.990> if<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.140> rush

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
not stupid so I figure well if I rush

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.170 
not stupid so I figure well if I rush
down<00:03:33.560> here<00:03:33.950> maybe<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.730> know<00:03:34.850> do<00:03:35.030> some

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
down here maybe I can you know do some

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.380 
down here maybe I can you know do some
damage<00:03:35.450> them<00:03:35.600> from<00:03:35.780> behind

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
damage them from behind

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.280 
damage them from behind
doesn't<00:03:38.390> seem<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.660> be<00:03:38.750> anybody<00:03:38.960> come<00:03:39.260> around

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
doesn't seem to be anybody come around

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.510 
doesn't seem to be anybody come around
the<00:03:39.590> lower<00:03:39.710> road<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.040> looks<00:03:40.190> like<00:03:40.310> they're<00:03:40.400> all

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
least one of them is so and the most up

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.220 
least one of them is so and the most up
here<00:03:46.580> I've<00:03:46.700> gotten<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.060> four<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.840> third<00:03:48.050> and

here I've gotten is four and a third and
and<00:03:48.910> now<00:03:49.910> look<00:03:50.330> at<00:03:50.510> how<00:03:51.040> stupid<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.820> for

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
and now look at how stupid this is for

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.410 
and now look at how stupid this is for
drivers<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:54.730> practically<00:03:55.730> young<00:03:55.880> place<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.270> can

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
drivers a practically young place I can
