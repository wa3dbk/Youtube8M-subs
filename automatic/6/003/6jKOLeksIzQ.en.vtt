00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
it's kind of sprinkling out here so I'm

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.639 
it's kind of sprinkling out here so I'm
not<00:00:45.820> going<00:00:46.059> to<00:00:46.120> video<00:00:46.360> much<00:00:46.630> but<00:00:47.079> I'll<00:00:47.440> show

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
you here in a minute what all we get

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.020 
you here in a minute what all we get
picked<00:00:53.100> well<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.250> wasn't<00:00:54.430> too<00:00:54.610> bad<00:00:54.640> of<00:00:54.969> a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
picked well that wasn't too bad of a

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.290 
picked well that wasn't too bad of a
haul<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:56.469> pick<00:00:57.250> most<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.670> there<00:00:57.879> was<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.000> lot<00:00:58.180> of

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
haul we pick most of there was a lot of

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.150 
haul we pick most of there was a lot of
small<00:00:58.600> ones<00:00:58.840> still<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.350> there<00:00:59.559> that<00:00:59.770> we<00:00:59.860> didn't

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
small ones still on there that we didn't

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.330 
small ones still on there that we didn't
we<00:01:00.489> didn't<00:01:00.730> pick<00:01:00.969> that<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.770> think<00:01:03.129> was<00:01:03.309> just

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
we didn't pick that I think was just

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.820 
we didn't pick that I think was just
probably<00:01:03.610> too<00:01:03.910> small<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.420> try<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.140> pickle<00:01:05.649> but

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
probably too small to try to pickle but

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.180 
probably too small to try to pickle but
uh<00:01:05.860> I<00:01:06.280> did<00:01:07.119> go<00:01:07.270> out<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.420> get<00:01:07.660> some<00:01:07.840> garlic<00:01:08.190> kind
