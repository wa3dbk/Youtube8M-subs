just<00:01:10.860> picked<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.369> case<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.820> pro<00:01:12.060> shells

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
just picked up a case of pro shells

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.890 
just picked up a case of pro shells
today<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.659> bit

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
today I think they are just a little bit

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
today I think they are just a little bit
better<00:01:16.049> than<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> exterminators<00:01:17.220> just

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
better than the exterminators just

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.120 
better than the exterminators just
because<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> exterminators<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.979> as

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because the exterminators are just as

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.690 
because the exterminators are just as
more<00:01:20.460> consistently<00:01:21.119> silvers<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.720> golds<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
more consistently silvers and golds and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.859 
more consistently silvers and golds and
with<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> pro<00:01:24.030> shells<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> little

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
with the pro shells you get a little

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.590 
with the pro shells you get a little
more<00:01:25.110> color<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.799> more<00:01:26.189> variety<00:01:27.150> and
