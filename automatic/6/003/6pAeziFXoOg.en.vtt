to do is go to the second chapter of
this<00:00:26.160> game<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> R<00:00:27.840> -<00:00:28.170> zero<00:00:28.560> -<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.099> I

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
this game which is R - zero - I think I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
this game which is R - zero - I think I
don't<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.570> stands<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.019> really

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
don't know what that stands for really

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.389 
don't know what that stands for really
maybe<00:00:31.679> rising<00:00:32.309> -<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.210> don't<00:00:34.170> know<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.980> yes<00:00:35.190> it's

maybe rising - I don't know but yes it's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
maybe rising - I don't know but yes it's
in<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.700> level<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.600> ways<00:00:36.780> into

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in this level it's a little ways into

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.090 
in this level it's a little ways into
this<00:00:37.290> level<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.460> before<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.480> use<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> BP

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
this level but before you can use a BP

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
exploit glitch or whatever you need to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.950 
exploit glitch or whatever you need to
defeat<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> guy<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.760> defeat<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.809> it's

friends and a stealth section in the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900 
friends and a stealth section in the
next<00:00:48.809> area<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.219> easy<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> get

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
next area it's really easy to get

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
next area it's really easy to get
through<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.690> mean<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.230> guy's<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:52.800> threat

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

through and I mean this guy's no threat
to<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.760> point<00:00:54.030> especially<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to you at this point especially if you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
to you at this point especially if you
finished<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> game<00:00:55.620> already<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:57.390> have

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
finished a game already and you have

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
finished a game already and you have
this<00:00:57.780> new<00:00:58.140> blade<00:01:00.320> I'm<00:01:01.320> pretty<00:01:01.590> sure<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this new blade I'm pretty sure you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
this new blade I'm pretty sure you
probably<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.820> main<00:01:03.480> blade<00:01:03.899> leveled<00:01:04.350> up

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
probably have the main blade leveled up

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
probably have the main blade leveled up
already<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.100> point<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.869> use

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
already by this point so you can use

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
already by this point so you can use
that<00:01:07.260> against<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.430> using<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.970> red

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that against them I'm using this red

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.690 
that against them I'm using this red
blade<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.580> it's<00:01:11.580> not

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
blade just because I want to it's not

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
blade just because I want to it's not
leveled<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.860> don't

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
leveled up at all I don't think I don't

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
leveled up at all I don't think I don't
think<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.580> got<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> level<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.509> yet<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.619> can

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
think I got to level it up yet you can

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
think I got to level it up yet you can
conceal<00:01:17.340> yourself<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:17.970> necessary

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
conceal yourself if necessary

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.660 
conceal yourself if necessary
okay<00:01:20.229> so<00:01:20.290> here's<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.740> little<00:01:20.920> stealth<00:01:21.280> section

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
okay so here's a little stealth section

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.350 
okay so here's a little stealth section
you<00:01:21.790> need<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:22.060> get<00:01:22.240> through<00:01:22.570> again<00:01:23.409> very<00:01:24.159> very

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you need to get through again very very

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.170 
you need to get through again very very
straightforward<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.950> plus<00:01:27.430> you've<00:01:27.640> done

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
straightforward and plus you've done

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.670 
straightforward and plus you've done
this<00:01:28.390> already<00:01:28.600> most<00:01:29.500> likely<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.590> is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
this already most likely but if this is

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.960 
this already most likely but if this is
your<00:01:32.799> first<00:01:33.040> time<00:01:33.190> through<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.549> game<00:01:33.759> and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
your first time through the game and

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.180 
your first time through the game and
you're<00:01:34.119> just<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.229> chapter<00:01:35.770> at<00:01:36.040> this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
you're just on this chapter at this

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.760 
you're just on this chapter at this
moment<00:01:36.430> again<00:01:37.420> it's<00:01:37.720> just<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:38.200> perfect<00:01:38.229> place

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
moment again it's just a perfect place

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.670 
moment again it's just a perfect place
to<00:01:38.799> farm<00:01:39.430> for<00:01:39.520> BP<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.450> after<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.350> take<00:01:41.530> out

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
to farm for BP so after you take out

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.789 
to farm for BP so after you take out
this<00:01:41.799> last<00:01:42.070> guy<00:01:42.430> over<00:01:42.789> here<00:01:43.440> let's<00:01:44.440> take<00:01:44.619> him

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
this last guy over here let's take him

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.930 
this last guy over here let's take him
out<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.899> slice<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.320> take<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> spine<00:01:48.670> or

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
out and slice and take a spine or

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.290 
out and slice and take a spine or
whatever<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.299> hell<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.690> huh<00:01:51.240> okay<00:01:52.240> so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
whatever the hell this is huh okay so

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.330 
whatever the hell this is huh okay so
you're<00:01:53.170> going<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.350> want<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> break<00:01:53.920> down<00:01:53.950> this

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
you're going to want to break down this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.910 
you're going to want to break down this
gate<00:01:54.729> over<00:01:55.030> here<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.509> jump<00:01:55.990> into<00:01:56.440> this<00:01:56.590> hole

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
gate over here and jump into this hole

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.880 
gate over here and jump into this hole
and<00:01:57.420> once<00:01:58.420> we<00:01:58.569> jump<00:01:58.840> down<00:01:58.869> there<00:01:59.289> that's<00:01:59.619> where

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
and once we jump down there that's where

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.090 
and once we jump down there that's where
we<00:02:00.100> are<00:02:00.130> going<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.610> be<00:02:00.729> exploiting<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.630> game

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
we are going to be exploiting the game

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.710 
we are going to be exploiting the game
so<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.310> we're<00:02:03.490> going<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.700> be<00:02:03.850> exploiting<00:02:04.539> is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
so what we're going to be exploiting is

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.570 
so what we're going to be exploiting is
the<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:07.090> level<00:02:07.659> up<00:02:07.899> option<00:02:08.739> inside<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
the the level up option inside of the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.090 
the the level up option inside of the
menu<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.660> in<00:02:10.989> this<00:02:11.260> section<00:02:11.560> you're<00:02:11.920> going<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
menu so in this section you're going to

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.539 
menu so in this section you're going to
want<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.310> alert<00:02:12.730> all<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.330> enemies<00:02:13.660> and

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
want to alert all of these enemies and

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.039 
want to alert all of these enemies and
destroy<00:02:15.549> them<00:02:16.000> all<00:02:16.209> without<00:02:16.420> taking<00:02:16.750> any

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
destroy them all without taking any

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.809 
destroy them all without taking any
damage<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.650> really<00:02:17.950> easy<00:02:18.130> all<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.519> need<00:02:18.700> to

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
damage it's really easy all you need to

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.509 
damage it's really easy all you need to
do<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.150> -<00:02:19.750> ahead<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.530> keep<00:02:20.680> slashing<00:02:21.100> you

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
do is - ahead and just keep slashing you

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.100 
do is - ahead and just keep slashing you
don't<00:02:21.700> have<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.940> actually<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.660> know<00:02:22.690> fight

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
don't have to actually you know fight

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.470 
don't have to actually you know fight
them<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:24.040> keep<00:02:24.250> running<00:02:24.489> around<00:02:24.730> slashing

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
them just keep running around slashing

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.910 
them just keep running around slashing
and<00:02:25.540> you'll<00:02:25.720> kill<00:02:25.959> them

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and you'll kill them

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.820 
and you'll kill them
and<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.540> said<00:02:28.780> you're<00:02:29.020> late<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:29.650> most

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
and as I said you're late it's most

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.320 
and as I said you're late it's most
likely<00:02:29.920> level<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.580> all<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.910> way<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.180> this

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
likely level up all the way at this

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.820 
likely level up all the way at this
point<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:31.840> they<00:02:31.990> should<00:02:32.200> go<00:02:32.380> down<00:02:32.560> pretty

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
point so they should go down pretty

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.699 
point so they should go down pretty
quickly<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:34.120> can<00:02:34.240> see<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:35.230> pretty<00:02:35.410> easy

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
quickly as you can see it's pretty easy

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.010 
quickly as you can see it's pretty easy
to<00:02:35.920> do<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.280> no<00:02:36.490> damage<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.209> once<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.630> do<00:02:37.810> all

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
to do this no damage and once you do all

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.970 
to do this no damage and once you do all
that<00:02:38.200> you're<00:02:38.380> going<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> want<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.740> come<00:02:38.950> back

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that you're going to want to come back

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.960 
that you're going to want to come back
over<00:02:39.459> here<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:40.000> these<00:02:40.750> two<00:02:41.050> enemies<00:02:41.530> use<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
over here to these two enemies use the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.840 
over here to these two enemies use the
Ripper<00:02:43.270> mode<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.959> slice<00:02:44.320> them<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.740> half<00:02:44.850> make

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
Ripper mode and slice them in half make

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.900 
Ripper mode and slice them in half make
sure<00:02:46.090> they<00:02:46.270> they<00:02:46.840> separate<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:48.520> if<00:02:48.760> they

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
sure they they separate because if they

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.120 
sure they they separate because if they
don't<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.360> won't<00:02:49.480> get<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.930> much<00:02:50.200> BP<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.010> will

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
don't you won't get as much BP you will

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.280 
don't you won't get as much BP you will
only<00:02:51.340> get<00:02:51.550> one<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.850> those<00:02:51.940> boxes<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.080> as<00:02:53.200> you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
only get one of those boxes but as you

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.760 
only get one of those boxes but as you
can<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:59.140> do<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.320> you're<00:02:59.650> going

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
can see that if we do that you're going

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.330 
can see that if we do that you're going
to<00:02:59.800> want<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.980> go<00:03:00.130> down<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.459> customize<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:02.340> what

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
to want to go down to customize and what

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.540 
to want to go down to customize and what
that<00:03:03.520> does<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.660> saves<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.709> amount<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.100> BP

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
that does is it saves the amount of BP

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.759 
that does is it saves the amount of BP
you<00:03:06.700> have<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.360> doesn't<00:03:07.690> save<00:03:07.959> your<00:03:08.290> actual

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
you have but it doesn't save your actual

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.120 
you have but it doesn't save your actual
progress<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.760> game<00:03:10.620> it'll<00:03:11.620> revert<00:03:11.980> you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
progress in the game it'll revert you

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.780 
progress in the game it'll revert you
back<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.610> last<00:03:12.820> checkpoint<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> because

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
back to the last checkpoint so because

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.300 
back to the last checkpoint so because
of<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.330> can<00:03:16.510> use<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.070> same

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
of that you can use this to do the same

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.720 
of that you can use this to do the same
section<00:03:18.820> over<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.330> over<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:20.140> gaining<00:03:20.769> BP<00:03:21.430> as

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
section over and over just gaining BP as

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.390 
section over and over just gaining BP as
quickly<00:03:22.510> as<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.380> as<00:03:23.890> far<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.340> can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
quickly as you can and as far as I can

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.699 
quickly as you can and as far as I can
tell<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.269> best<00:03:25.510> spot<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:26.080> farm<00:03:26.620> for

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
tell this is the best spot to farm for

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.640 
tell this is the best spot to farm for
BP<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.120> game<00:03:28.360> because<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:29.140> mean<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.500> do

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
BP in the game because I mean you can do

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.620 
BP in the game because I mean you can do
it<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.980> quickly<00:03:30.430> just<00:03:30.459> run<00:03:30.760> around<00:03:30.880> slashing

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
it so quickly just run around slashing

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.960 
it so quickly just run around slashing
all<00:03:31.750> those<00:03:31.959> guys<00:03:32.110> get<00:03:32.470> an<00:03:32.560> s-rank<00:03:32.980> then<00:03:33.670> run<00:03:33.940> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
all those guys get an s-rank then run to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.120 
all those guys get an s-rank then run to
the<00:03:34.209> special<00:03:34.600> enemy<00:03:34.959> in<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.200> back<00:03:35.440> slash<00:03:35.890> them

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
the special enemy in the back slash them

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.759 
the special enemy in the back slash them
in<00:03:36.220> half<00:03:36.630> kill<00:03:37.630> them<00:03:37.810> too<00:03:38.049> while<00:03:38.590> they're

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
in half kill them too while they're

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.280 
in half kill them too while they're
separated<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.700> get<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.090> two<00:03:40.299> boxes<00:03:41.230> that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
separated and you get the two boxes that

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.750 
separated and you get the two boxes that
are<00:03:41.500> worth<00:03:41.769> quite<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.130> bit<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.489> BP<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:44.730> what<00:03:45.730> I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
are worth quite a bit of BP so what I

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.360 
are worth quite a bit of BP so what I
did<00:03:45.910> was<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.720> just<00:03:46.840> used<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.590> exploit<00:03:48.190> to

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
did was I just used this exploit to

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.670 
did was I just used this exploit to
level<00:03:48.670> up<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.970> red<00:03:49.360> blade<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> way<00:03:50.410> it's

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
level up this red blade all the way it's

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.400 
level up this red blade all the way it's
really<00:03:51.250> really<00:03:51.790> simple<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.269> do<00:03:52.480> as<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.260> can

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
really really simple to do as you can

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.860 
really really simple to do as you can
see<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.590> just<00:03:53.739> killed<00:03:54.190> those<00:03:54.370> two<00:03:54.579> again<00:03:54.880> got

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
see I just killed those two again got

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.289 
see I just killed those two again got
quite<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> lot<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.410> BP<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.220> then<00:03:57.700> I'm<00:03:57.970> going<00:03:58.239> to

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
quite a lot of BP and then I'm going to

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.680 
quite a lot of BP and then I'm going to
go<00:03:59.040> again<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.310> use<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.760> customized<00:04:01.299> glitch

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
go again and use the customized glitch

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.560 
go again and use the customized glitch
or<00:04:02.670> exploit<00:04:03.670> rather<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.030> don't<00:04:04.299> think<00:04:04.450> it's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
or exploit rather I don't think it's

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.690 
or exploit rather I don't think it's
really<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:05.230> more<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.560> an<00:04:05.650> exploit<00:04:06.280> game

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
really just more of an exploit game

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.229 
really just more of an exploit game
exploit<00:04:07.440> but<00:04:08.440> yeah<00:04:08.709> as<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.370> said<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.760> saves<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
exploit but yeah as I said it saves the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.840 
exploit but yeah as I said it saves the
amount<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.570> BP<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.170> have<00:04:11.410> but<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.430> doesn't

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
amount of BP you have but it doesn't

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.490 
amount of BP you have but it doesn't
save<00:04:13.060> your<00:04:13.239> progress<00:04:13.480> which<00:04:13.930> is<00:04:14.049> awesome

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
save your progress which is awesome

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.830 
save your progress which is awesome
unlike<00:04:14.950> using<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.970> restart<00:04:16.510> option<00:04:16.959> which

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
unlike using the restart option which

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.910 
unlike using the restart option which
only<00:04:19.239> actually<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.510> just<00:04:21.140> resets<00:04:21.560> everything

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
only actually it just resets everything

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.220 
only actually it just resets everything
it<00:04:22.160> doesn't<00:04:22.340> save<00:04:22.640> your<00:04:22.790> BP<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.810> do<00:04:24.080> not

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
it doesn't save your BP so you do not

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.900 
it doesn't save your BP so you do not
want<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.500> use<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.620> restart<00:04:25.160> option<00:04:25.310> be<00:04:25.670> sure<00:04:25.700> to

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
want to use a restart option be sure to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.420 
want to use a restart option be sure to
go<00:04:26.180> down<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.720> customize<00:04:27.350> we're<00:04:27.950> doing<00:04:28.250> that

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
go down to customize we're doing that

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.790 
go down to customize we're doing that
and<00:04:28.700> as<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.420> can<00:04:29.630> see<00:04:29.690> I'm<00:04:30.110> getting<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.590> lot<00:04:30.770> of

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
and as you can see I'm getting a lot of

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.640 
and as you can see I'm getting a lot of
BP<00:04:31.280> very<00:04:31.580> quickly<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:33.110> again<00:04:33.410> I'm<00:04:33.620> only

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
BP very quickly but again I'm only

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.710 
BP very quickly but again I'm only
showing<00:04:34.100> myself<00:04:34.610> fighting<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.150> last<00:04:35.450> two

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
showing myself fighting the last two

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.810 
showing myself fighting the last two
enemies<00:04:36.200> but<00:04:37.010> you're<00:04:37.160> gonna<00:04:37.280> want<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.610> run

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
enemies but you're gonna want to run

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.100 
enemies but you're gonna want to run
around<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.360> do<00:04:38.510> what<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.660> did<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:39.020> the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
around and do what I did in the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.680 
around and do what I did in the
beginning<00:04:39.280> run<00:04:40.280> around<00:04:40.370> kills<00:04:40.820> guys<00:04:41.300> get<00:04:41.600> an

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
beginning run around kills guys get an

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.350 
beginning run around kills guys get an
s-rank<00:04:42.170> then<00:04:42.530> run<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.130> two<00:04:43.760> on<00:04:43.970> top<00:04:44.180> of

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
s-rank then run to the two on top of

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.010 
s-rank then run to the two on top of
each<00:04:44.510> other

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
each other

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.160 
each other
and<00:04:45.730> slice<00:04:46.730> them<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.030> half<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.510> get<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.780> boxes

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
and slice them in half and get the boxes

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.530 
and slice them in half and get the boxes
because<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.340> boxes<00:04:49.820> are<00:04:50.030> worth<00:04:50.210> quite<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.450> bit

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
because the boxes are worth quite a bit

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.050 
because the boxes are worth quite a bit
as<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:51.050> previously<00:04:51.650> said<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.370> I'm<00:04:52.790> going<00:04:52.970> to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
as I previously said so I'm going to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.790 
as I previously said so I'm going to
show<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.450> whole<00:04:53.480> thing<00:04:53.690> again<00:04:54.260> just<00:04:54.290> so<00:04:54.740> you

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
show the whole thing again just so you

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.110 
show the whole thing again just so you
know<00:04:55.220> what<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.730> do

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
know what to do

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.910 
know what to do
and<00:04:56.240> as<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.450> can<00:04:56.570> see<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:57.080> have<00:04:57.230> quite<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.620> lot<00:04:57.890> of

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
and as you can see I have quite a lot of

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.490 
and as you can see I have quite a lot of
BP<00:04:58.400> at<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.760> point<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.360> think<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.020> did<00:05:00.350> this

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
BP at this point I think I did this

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.570 
BP at this point I think I did this
about<00:05:01.690> at<00:05:02.690> this<00:05:03.410> point<00:05:03.740> that's<00:05:04.070> probably<00:05:04.430> like

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
about at this point that's probably like

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.140 
about at this point that's probably like
12<00:05:05.180> times<00:05:05.540> maybe<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:07.010> had<00:05:07.250> already<00:05:07.400> used<00:05:07.880> a

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
12 times maybe and I had already used a

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.990 
12 times maybe and I had already used a
bunch<00:05:08.330> of<00:05:08.450> BP<00:05:08.900> at<00:05:09.050> this<00:05:09.230> point<00:05:09.500> as<00:05:09.620> well<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.790> as

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
bunch of BP at this point as well so as

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.760 
bunch of BP at this point as well so as
you<00:05:11.090> can<00:05:11.240> see<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.540> red<00:05:11.690> blade<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.140> level<00:05:12.620> up

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
you can see the red blade is level up

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.380 
you can see the red blade is level up
quite<00:05:13.040> a<00:05:13.070> bit<00:05:13.370> it's<00:05:13.640> destroying<00:05:14.150> these

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
quite a bit it's destroying these

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.430 
quite a bit it's destroying these
enemies<00:05:14.840> pretty<00:05:15.410> quickly<00:05:15.800> I<00:05:17.110> don't<00:05:18.110> remember

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
enemies pretty quickly I don't remember

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.930 
enemies pretty quickly I don't remember
what<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.740> red<00:05:18.980> blade<00:05:19.250> is<00:05:19.400> called<00:05:19.670> I<00:05:19.760> was<00:05:19.820> gonna

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
what the red blade is called I was gonna

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.870 
what the red blade is called I was gonna
say<00:05:20.180> Muramasa<00:05:20.780> but<00:05:21.230> I<00:05:21.920> know<00:05:22.250> it's<00:05:22.430> not<00:05:22.640> that

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
say Muramasa but I know it's not that

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.520 
say Muramasa but I know it's not that
just<00:05:23.180> looks<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.420> it<00:05:23.630> says<00:05:23.810> Muramasa

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
just looks like it says Muramasa

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.040 
just looks like it says Muramasa
but<00:05:24.920> again<00:05:25.130> activate<00:05:25.670> Ripper<00:05:26.210> mode<00:05:26.450> slice

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
but again activate Ripper mode slice

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.740 
but again activate Ripper mode slice
them<00:05:27.260> in<00:05:27.350> half<00:05:27.380> kill<00:05:28.310> them<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.760> take<00:05:28.820> their<00:05:29.270> BP

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
them in half kill them and take their BP

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.520 
them in half kill them and take their BP
and<00:05:30.700> at<00:05:31.700> this<00:05:31.880> point<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.390> can<00:05:32.570> already<00:05:32.900> level<00:05:33.380> up

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
and at this point I can already level up

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.840 
and at this point I can already level up
the<00:05:33.650> blade<00:05:33.890> completely<00:05:34.760> which<00:05:35.060> is<00:05:35.210> awesome

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
the blade completely which is awesome

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.310 
the blade completely which is awesome
I'm<00:05:37.850> not<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.270> don't<00:05:38.330> think<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:38.810> was<00:05:38.900> levelled<00:05:39.260> up

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
I'm not I don't think it was levelled up

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.640 
I'm not I don't think it was levelled up
all<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.710> way<00:05:39.830> at<00:05:39.950> this<00:05:40.100> point<00:05:40.840> let's<00:05:41.840> see<00:05:42.050> huh

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
all the way at this point let's see huh

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.219 
all the way at this point let's see huh
come<00:05:45.280> on<00:05:49.560> okay

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
come on okay

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.600 
come on okay
yeah<00:05:53.229> I<00:05:53.259> don't<00:05:53.710> think<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:54.039> was<00:05:54.160> level<00:05:54.490> up

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
yeah I don't think it was level up

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.210 
yeah I don't think it was level up
completely<00:05:55.289> yeah<00:05:56.289> I<00:05:56.320> still<00:05:56.530> needed<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.860> level

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
completely yeah I still needed to level

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.310
