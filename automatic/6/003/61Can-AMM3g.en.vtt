but<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:17.210> started<00:01:22.640> before<00:01:23.640> what

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but it was this much started before what

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.770 
but it was this much started before what
difference<00:01:24.210> does<00:01:24.300> it<00:01:24.360> make

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
difference does it make

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.070 
difference does it make
because<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.289> put<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.679> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.220> press<00:01:27.149> will

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
because when I put it in the press will

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.850 
because when I put it in the press will
be<00:01:28.200> easier

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
be easier

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.100 
be easier
oops<00:01:29.100> me<00:01:29.420> put<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.539> in<00:01:30.720> here

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.340 

this<00:01:33.650> thing<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:33.980> in<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.250> way<00:01:34.400> but<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:35.990> cut<00:01:36.230> it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
this thing is in a way but if I cut it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.210 
this thing is in a way but if I cut it
off<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.440> see<00:01:39.920> they'll<00:01:40.280> be<00:01:40.520> easier<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.660> that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
off so I see they'll be easier to that

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.440 
off so I see they'll be easier to that
this<00:01:43.220> little<00:01:43.580> trick<00:01:48.490> I'll<00:01:49.490> make<00:01:49.730> enough<00:01:50.060> lemon

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
at the mango this is the narrower side

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.710 
at the mango this is the narrower side
pit<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.740> parallel<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.670> do<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.450> know<00:02:11.570> that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
pit is parallel to this do you know that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.410 
pit is parallel to this do you know that
okay<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:13.280> know<00:02:13.400> then<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> cut<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.120> then<00:02:14.330> you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
okay you know then you cut it then you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.140 
okay you know then you cut it then you
get<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.690> most<00:02:14.840> meat<00:02:15.170> out<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.220> when<00:02:17.000> you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
get the most meat out of it when you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.520 
get the most meat out of it when you
pick<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.570> mango<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.500> be<00:02:18.650> hard<00:02:18.950> not<00:02:19.430> right

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
pick the mango is to be hard not right

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.600 
pick the mango is to be hard not right
because<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.770> have<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.430> careful

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
because you have to be really careful

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.050 
because you have to be really careful
cutting<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.330> because<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.490> not<00:02:25.490> soft

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
cutting this because it's not soft

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.020 
cutting this because it's not soft
okay<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> easiest<00:02:31.760> way

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
okay and then that's the easiest way

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.420 
okay and then that's the easiest way
then<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.660> want<00:02:32.840> less<00:02:33.800> chance<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.250> cutting

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
then you want less chance of cutting

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.420 
then you want less chance of cutting
yourself<00:02:38.080> did<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.230> peel<00:02:39.470> off<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.950> skin<00:02:40.130> as

yourself did you peel off the skin as
well<00:02:40.610> yeah<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.239> do<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.510> both<00:02:41.660> way<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.290> can

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
well yeah you can do it both way you can

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.949 
well yeah you can do it both way you can
use<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> peeler<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.400> peel<00:02:43.430> off<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> skin<00:02:44.000> but

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
use a peeler to peel off the skin but

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.070 
use a peeler to peel off the skin but
it's<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.380> glue<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.890> have<00:02:46.130> small<00:02:46.400> hand<00:02:46.700> then<00:02:47.080> a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
it's like glue I have small hand then a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.050 
it's like glue I have small hand then a
bit<00:02:48.320> difficult<00:02:48.830> for<00:02:48.890> me<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.400> do<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:49.790> way

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.240 

it's<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.330> little<00:02:53.600> bit<00:02:53.780> easier<00:02:53.810> on<00:02:54.470> my<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:55.190> my

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
it's a little bit easier on my on my
