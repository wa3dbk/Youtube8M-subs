00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
really helps live sometimes you just

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.210 
really helps live sometimes you just
have<00:00:31.720> once<00:00:32.110> in<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.439> air<00:00:32.560> and<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:32.860> want<00:00:33.070> to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
have different sounds for different

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.400 
have different sounds for different
songs<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.970> you<00:00:37.149> know<00:00:37.180> without<00:00:37.480> sometimes<00:00:38.290> you

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
songs and you know without sometimes you

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.170 
songs and you know without sometimes you
don't<00:00:38.500> have<00:00:38.680> time<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.130> change<00:00:39.399> from<00:00:39.610> one<00:00:39.700> snare

sound<00:02:10.310> even<00:02:10.670> fatter<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:12.080> bit<00:02:12.260> dirtier<00:02:12.740> you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
sound even fatter and a bit dirtier you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.370 
sound even fatter and a bit dirtier you
could<00:02:13.070> just<00:02:13.250> really<00:02:13.430> lifts<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.810> snares<00:02:15.140> on

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.060 
could just really lifts it the snares on
the<00:02:15.500> bottom<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.860> that's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
the bottom see you like that so that's

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:39.880 
the bottom see you like that so that's
even<00:02:22.220> lower<00:02:23.920> sounding<00:02:38.110> pretty<00:02:39.110> cool<00:02:39.440> isn't<00:02:39.650> it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
even lower sounding pretty cool isn't it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.910

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.490 
totally different snare so another thing
you<00:02:54.680> could<00:02:54.830> do<00:02:55.040> is

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
you could do is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.140 
you could do is
is<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.220> turn<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.640> snare<00:02:58.970> over<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.690> use

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.690 

and<00:03:04.269> hit<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.110> stairs<00:03:05.470> very<00:03:05.650> softly<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
and hit the stairs very softly the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.199 
and hit the stairs very softly the
reason<00:03:06.940> why<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.060> say<00:03:07.330> softly<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:09.610> they're

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
reason why I say softly because they're

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.290 
reason why I say softly because they're
very<00:03:10.390> delicate<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.470> could<00:03:11.890> easily<00:03:12.550> you

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
very delicate and you could easily you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.630 
very delicate and you could easily you
know<00:03:13.450> get<00:03:14.140> them<00:03:14.319> all<00:03:14.500> bent<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.160> crooked<00:03:15.550> and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
know get them all bent and crooked and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.460 
know get them all bent and crooked and
in<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> snare<00:03:16.120> won't<00:03:16.330> sound<00:03:16.540> good<00:03:16.720> anymore

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
in the snare won't sound good anymore

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.369 
in the snare won't sound good anymore
so<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> good<00:03:18.459> idea<00:03:18.580> just<00:03:18.819> need<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.720> if<00:03:20.170> you

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
so a good idea just need to have if you

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.309 
so a good idea just need to have if you
have<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.620> really<00:03:21.269> crappy<00:03:22.269> sounding<00:03:22.720> snare<00:03:22.900> or
