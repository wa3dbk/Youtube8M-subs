00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.799 

right<00:01:02.350> over<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:03.280> I<00:01:03.400> got<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:04.120> jet<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.600> comes

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
right over and I got to jet that comes

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.220 
right over and I got to jet that comes
out<00:01:05.019> one<00:01:05.890> that's<00:01:06.130> pushing<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:07.570> here<00:01:07.840> towards

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
out one that's pushing up here towards

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.050 
out one that's pushing up here towards
the<00:01:08.380> front<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.830> sends<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.190> water<00:01:12.430> pushing

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
the front so it sends the water pushing

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.630 
the front so it sends the water pushing
back<00:01:13.240> towards<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.840> intake<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.860> got<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.520> other

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
back towards the intake I got the other

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.790 
back towards the intake I got the other
one<00:01:15.729> tilted<00:01:16.240> up<00:01:16.360> more<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.320> kind<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.530> creates

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
one tilted up more so it kind of creates

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.219 
one tilted up more so it kind of creates
like<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> little<00:01:18.190> bit<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.430> current<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:20.050> when<00:01:20.200> I

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
like a little bit of a current so when I

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.200 
like a little bit of a current so when I
feed<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.770> turtles<00:01:21.430> all<00:01:21.640> their<00:01:21.850> letters<00:01:22.060> and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
feed the turtles all their letters and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.150 
feed the turtles all their letters and
everything<00:01:22.630> stays<00:01:22.960> over<00:01:23.260> here<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.070> it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
everything stays over here and it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.140 
everything stays over here and it
doesn't<00:01:24.340> go<00:01:24.520> around<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.850> tank<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:27.250> still

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
doesn't go around the tank and I still

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.180 
doesn't go around the tank and I still
got<00:01:28.300> one<00:01:28.479> aqua<00:01:28.840> clear<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.229> for<00:01:29.560> now<00:01:29.680> just<00:01:29.979> as

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
got one aqua clear on for now just as

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.270 
got one aqua clear on for now just as
you<00:01:30.520> know<00:01:30.610> more<00:01:31.090> filtration<00:01:31.660> of<00:01:31.750> better<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
you know more filtration of better and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.590 
you know more filtration of better and
then<00:01:33.369> when<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.490> split<00:01:33.729> up<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.030> tank<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.450> have

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
then when I split up the tank and I have

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.660 
then when I split up the tank and I have
the<00:01:34.750> turtles<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.290> their<00:01:35.560> own<00:01:35.710> tank<00:01:36.009> I'll<00:01:36.490> have

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the turtles in their own tank I'll have

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.210 
the turtles in their own tank I'll have
to<00:01:36.850> offer<00:01:37.149> clears<00:01:37.390> on<00:01:37.570> that<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.930> I'll<00:01:38.020> have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to offer clears on that and I'll have

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:51.389 
to offer clears on that and I'll have
the<00:01:39.220> fx5<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.630> fish<00:01:40.810> tank<00:01:41.080> by<00:01:41.259> itself

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
that's crazy

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:05.960
