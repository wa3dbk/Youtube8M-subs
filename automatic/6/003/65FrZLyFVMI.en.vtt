00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:37.739 
much rain it leads to silk rot and silk

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.419 
much rain it leads to silk rot and silk
rot<00:01:37.979> happens<00:01:38.459> when<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:40.110> silk<00:01:40.470> basically

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
rot happens when your silk basically

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.400 
rot happens when your silk basically
rots<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.479> gets<00:01:42.630> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:42.989> a<00:01:43.050> mildew

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
rots and it gets kind of like a mildew

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.029 
rots and it gets kind of like a mildew
and<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.069> prohibits<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:46.110> pollen<00:01:46.619> from

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
and it prohibits the the pollen from

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.219 
and it prohibits the the pollen from
landing<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.270> corn<00:01:48.539> this<00:01:48.720> also<00:01:48.899> happens

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
landing on the corn this also happens

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.089 
landing on the corn this also happens
when<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.530> cold<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:50.910> this<00:01:51.209> is<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.569> that

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
when it's cold and so this is one that

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.740 
when it's cold and so this is one that
basically<00:01:53.099> won't<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.459> any<00:01:53.610> bigger<00:01:53.789> and<00:01:54.119> I'm

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
still edible you know I mean this could

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.470 
still edible you know I mean this could
still<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.280> cooked<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.239> not<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
still be cooked but it's not going to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.119 
still be cooked but it's not going to
have<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> flavor<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.770> also<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.069> going

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
have the flavor and it's also not going

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.890 
have the flavor and it's also not going
to<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> size<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> normal<00:02:15.660> one<00:02:15.750> would

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to have the size that a normal one would

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.380 
to have the size that a normal one would
have<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.470> each<00:02:16.920> silk<00:02:17.459> these<00:02:17.910> silks<00:02:18.270> right

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
have because each silk these silks right

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.899 
have because each silk these silks right
here<00:02:18.569> each<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:19.470> silks<00:02:19.890> goes<00:02:20.609> to<00:02:20.849> a

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
here each one of these silks goes to a

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.449 
here each one of these silks goes to a
kernel<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.450> if<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> spot<00:02:23.250> where

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
kernel and so if you have a spot where

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.580 
kernel and so if you have a spot where
sometimes<00:02:23.969> you<00:02:24.209> might<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> gap

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
sometimes you might have like a gap

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.330 
sometimes you might have like a gap
where<00:02:25.859> there's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
where there's

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.059 
where there's
only<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:27.750> two<00:02:27.989> or<00:02:28.080> three<00:02:28.110> corn<00:02:28.470> kernels

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
only like two or three corn kernels

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.589 
only like two or three corn kernels
missing<00:02:29.400> that's<00:02:29.790> because<00:02:30.030> that's<00:02:30.150> silk

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
missing that's because that's silk

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.809 
missing that's because that's silk
coming<00:02:30.989> out<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.650> pollinated<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.670> it

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
coming out was not pollinated so it

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.880 
coming out was not pollinated so it
didn't<00:02:33.239> pollinate<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.660> one<00:02:33.989> kernel<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
didn't pollinate that one kernel in the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.430 
didn't pollinate that one kernel in the
middle<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.310> cob<00:02:35.520> there<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
middle of the cob there so this one is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.710 
middle of the cob there so this one is
an<00:02:37.620> example<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.940> was<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.360> properly

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
an example of one that was not properly

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
an example of one that was not properly
pollinated<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.610> want<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> look<00:02:41.880> for

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
pollinated so what you want to look for

is you want to you want to look for a
nice<00:02:44.430> full<00:02:45.150> cob<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.349> want<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> look<00:02:46.680> for

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
nice full cob and you want to look for

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.650 
nice full cob and you want to look for
ones<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> silks<00:02:47.819> have<00:02:48.030> turned<00:02:48.300> brown

so thank you all for tuning in for this
harvest<00:06:43.389> video<00:06:43.630> we<00:06:44.139> didn't<00:06:44.410> quite<00:06:44.650> get<00:06:44.830> a

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
harvest video we didn't quite get a

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.409 
harvest video we didn't quite get a
wheelbarrow<00:06:45.039> full<00:06:45.400> but<00:06:45.550> that's<00:06:45.699> fine<00:06:46.090> because

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
wheelbarrow full but that's fine because

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.749 
wheelbarrow full but that's fine because
that<00:06:46.750> we<00:06:47.080> would<00:06:47.350> rather<00:06:48.039> have<00:06:48.370> them<00:06:48.580> get

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
that we would rather have them get

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.400 
that we would rather have them get
full-size<00:06:49.240> so<00:06:49.570> we<00:06:49.660> actually<00:06:49.810> probably<00:06:50.139> left

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
full-size so we actually probably left

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.070 
full-size so we actually probably left
about<00:06:51.160> half<00:06:51.460> the<00:06:51.789> corn<00:06:52.180> actually<00:06:52.600> still<00:06:52.870> on

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
about half the corn actually still on

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.379 
about half the corn actually still on
the<00:06:53.440> stalks<00:06:54.190> so<00:06:54.460> they're<00:06:54.669> still<00:06:54.940> getting

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
the stalks so they're still getting

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.060 
the stalks so they're still getting
larger<00:06:55.930> we<00:06:56.050> harvested<00:06:56.440> the<00:06:56.560> biggest<00:06:56.860> ones

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070
