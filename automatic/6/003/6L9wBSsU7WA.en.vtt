your signal is buried in noise few

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.560 
your signal is buried in noise few
people<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.439> respond<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.759> people<00:01:18.240> come<00:01:18.450> back

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

people will respond if people come back
to<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.929> CQ<00:01:19.350> calls<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.579> a<00:01:20.729> sure<00:01:20.909> sign

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to your CQ calls then that's a sure sign

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.120 
to your CQ calls then that's a sure sign
that<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.840> signal<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.439> better<00:01:22.740> than<00:01:22.979> average

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

stations that you contact if they're
fairly<00:02:39.000> strong<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.810> must<00:02:40.110> mean<00:02:40.350> there's<00:02:40.739> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
fairly strong it must mean there's a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.890 
fairly strong it must mean there's a
good<00:02:41.040> path<00:02:41.280> although<00:02:41.670> using<00:02:42.090> good<00:02:42.360> antennas

if<00:02:43.680> they're<00:02:43.980> fairly<00:02:44.190> weak<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.209> try

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
if they're fairly weak you can try

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.870 
if they're fairly weak you can try
calling<00:02:45.660> them<00:02:45.959> no<00:02:46.680> harm<00:02:46.920> trying<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.760> you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
calling them no harm trying but you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.180 
calling them no harm trying but you
probably<00:02:48.269> won't<00:02:48.540> work<00:02:48.780> them<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.010> your

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
probably won't work them but if your

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.309 
probably won't work them but if your
station<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:50.940> effective<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:51.989> you

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
station is really effective then you

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080 
station is really effective then you
will<00:02:52.530> start<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.980> work<00:02:53.190> some<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> weaker

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
will start to work some of the weaker

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930 
will start to work some of the weaker
signals<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:55.290> there's<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.709> by<00:02:55.860> qrp<00:02:56.430> contacts

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
signals then there's two by qrp contacts

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.309 
signals then there's two by qrp contacts
that's<00:02:57.630> pretty<00:02:57.959> easy

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
that's pretty easy

then to make you RP contacts are fairly

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.400 
then to make you RP contacts are fairly
rare<00:03:11.150> especially<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.269> both<00:03:12.510> ends<00:03:12.750> are<00:03:12.930> using
