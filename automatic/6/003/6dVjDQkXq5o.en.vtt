00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.039 
focus on basically is playing hard
defensively<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> offensively<00:00:14.880> I've<00:00:15.780> worked

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
defensively and offensively I've worked

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.050 
defensively and offensively I've worked
my<00:00:16.139> offensive<00:00:16.590> game<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.460> coming<00:00:17.699> slowly

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
my offensive game but it's coming slowly

my offensive game but it's coming slowly
