instance meinl t come with two different

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.760 
instance meinl t come with two different
varieties<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.190> fitting<00:00:05.670> material<00:00:06.770> well

varieties of fitting material well

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.200 
varieties of fitting material well
they're<00:00:08.010> both<00:00:08.130> basically<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.790> same<00:00:09.000> they

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
they're both basically the same they

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.850 
they're both basically the same they
look<00:00:09.360> different<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:11.490> center<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.860> our

water is not hot enough it will take

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.440 
water is not hot enough it will take

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
longer if this is the case simply place

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
longer if this is the case simply place
the<00:00:45.660> glass<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.500> microwave<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.100> 30<00:00:47.370> seconds

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the glass into microwave for 30 seconds

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.529 
the glass into microwave for 30 seconds
or<00:00:48.420> until<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.110> beads<00:00:49.289> become<00:00:49.739> clear<00:00:50.539> don't

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
or until the beads become clear don't

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
or until the beads become clear don't
worry<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:51.960> rushing<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.520> step

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
worry about rushing because this step

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
worry about rushing because this step
can<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.969> repeated<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.600> many<00:00:54.629> times<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
can be repeated as many times as you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.229 
can be repeated as many times as you
need

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.939 

the<00:01:00.239> next<00:01:00.540> step<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> begin<00:01:01.110> shaping<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the next step is to begin shaping the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
the next step is to begin shaping the
instant<00:01:02.370> smile<00:01:02.610> teeth<00:01:02.910> themselves<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> do

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
instant smile teeth themselves you do

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.140 
instant smile teeth themselves you do
this<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.739> putting<00:01:04.979> them<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> same<00:01:05.550> hot

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this by putting them in the same hot

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.780 
this by putting them in the same hot
water<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.960> fitting<00:01:07.260> plastic<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:08.310> careful

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
water as the fitting plastic be careful

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.999 
water as the fitting plastic be careful
not<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> place<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.840> teeth<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.350> top<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
not to place the teeth on top of the

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.100 
not to place the teeth on top of the
melting<00:01:11.700> fitting<00:01:12.240> plastic<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:12.930> might

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
melting fitting plastic as they might

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.399 
melting fitting plastic as they might
stick<00:01:13.409> together<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:14.000> need<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.270> soften<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
stick together you need to soften the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
stick together you need to soften the
instant<00:01:16.800> smile<00:01:17.009> teeth<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.940> can<00:01:18.180> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
instant smile teeth so they can be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.899 
instant smile teeth so they can be
molded<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> exact<00:01:19.710> curvature<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> shape
