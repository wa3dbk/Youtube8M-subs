00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
so maybe gluten-free and lactose free

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.479 
so maybe gluten-free and lactose free
diet<00:02:34.080> yeah<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:38.290> might<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.830> little<00:02:39.040> tough<00:02:39.220> but

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
diet yeah it might be a little tough but

diet yeah it might be a little tough but
it's<00:02:39.970> getting<00:02:40.239> better<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.660> there<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.260> that

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
it's getting better out there so that

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.560 
it's getting better out there so that
seems<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.100> be<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> thing<00:02:42.580> yeah<00:02:43.030> there's<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.420> lot

and so
the<00:02:53.480> flower<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.230> they're<00:02:54.380> good<00:02:54.650> mm-hmm

I'm<00:03:29.959> silly<00:03:30.290> acts<00:03:30.440> bro<00:03:30.770> that's<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.790> then

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
I'm silly acts bro that's it and then

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.180 
I'm silly acts bro that's it and then
it's<00:03:32.870> just<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:33.110> simple<00:03:33.140> blood<00:03:33.530> test<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.040> then

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
it's just a simple blood test and then

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.490 
it's just a simple blood test and then
you<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:34.550> go<00:03:34.670> from<00:03:34.850> there<00:03:35.150> about<00:03:35.470> doing<00:03:36.470> a

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
you can go from there about doing a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.180 
you can go from there about doing a
glucose<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.880> means<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.360> gluten<00:03:38.900> free

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
glucose that means like a gluten free

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.130 
glucose that means like a gluten free
products<00:03:40.190> though<00:03:40.340> yeah<00:03:40.640> definitely<00:03:41.300> yeah<00:03:41.810> I

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
products though yeah definitely yeah I
