do at home so just talk us through what
you<00:00:27.420> were<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.020> that<00:00:28.200> in<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.410> session

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
you were doing in that in that session

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.580 
you were doing in that in that session
there<00:00:29.160> well<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> start<00:00:30.450> off<00:00:30.690> jump<00:00:31.350> with<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
there well you start off jump with you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.040 
there well you start off jump with you
cross<00:00:31.830> poles<00:00:32.449> hopefully<00:00:33.449> he<00:00:33.540> lands<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
cross poles hopefully he lands on the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.680 
cross poles hopefully he lands on the
right<00:00:34.170> leg<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.830> he<00:00:35.220> doesn't<00:00:35.460> pull<00:00:36.210> him<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
right leg and he doesn't pull him up and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.920 
right leg and he doesn't pull him up and
correct<00:00:36.989> him<00:00:38.270> canter<00:00:39.270> away<00:00:39.480> different

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
correct him canter away different

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.960 
correct him canter away different
different<00:00:40.710> ways<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.280> two<00:00:41.400> or<00:00:41.460> three<00:00:41.550> times

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
different ways do it two or three times

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.170 
different ways do it two or three times
just<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.660> loosen<00:00:42.810> up<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.290> their<00:00:43.470> body<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.800> bit

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
just to loosen up in their body a bit

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.100 
just to loosen up in their body a bit
and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> move<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.440> jump<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> vertical

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
and then you move on you jump a vertical

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.270 
and then you move on you jump a vertical
whatever<00:00:49.110> height<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.530> happy<00:00:49.829> starting

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
whatever height you're happy starting

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.170 
whatever height you're happy starting
with<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.450> go<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> couple<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.590> times<00:00:53.180> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
with and then go up a couple of times so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
with and then go up a couple of times so
you're<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.020> feel<00:00:55.200> happy<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.559> he<00:00:55.620> also<00:00:55.739> has

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you're you feel happy that he also has

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.620 
you're you feel happy that he also has
loosened<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.309> enough<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.760> ring<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.450> is

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
loosened up enough for the ring so is

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.150 
loosened up enough for the ring so is
that<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> normal<00:00:57.960> procedure<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.950> at

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that a normal procedure what you do at

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.709 
that a normal procedure what you do at
home<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.910> were<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.360> start<00:01:00.570> going

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
home if you were about to start going

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.150 
home if you were about to start going
into<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> training<00:01:01.170> session<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.920> quite

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
into a training session or is that quite

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.470 
into a training session or is that quite
a<00:01:02.190> specific<00:01:02.430> warmup<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> would

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a specific warmup that you would

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
a specific warmup that you would
actually<00:01:03.540> do<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.020> competition<00:01:04.410> no<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.160> do

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
actually do at a competition no you do

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.460 
actually do at a competition no you do
at<00:01:05.640> home<00:01:05.880> end<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> competition<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.110> start<00:01:07.380> off

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
at home end a competition you start off

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.190 
at home end a competition you start off
on<00:01:07.500> across<00:01:07.890> bold<00:01:08.190> few<00:01:08.430> times<00:01:08.670> verticals<00:01:09.630> move

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
on across bold few times verticals move

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.190 
on across bold few times verticals move
to<00:01:10.380> oxes<00:01:11.450> balance<00:01:12.450> coming<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> fence

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to oxes balance coming to the fence

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.950 
to oxes balance coming to the fence
balance<00:01:14.010> away<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.420> try<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.600> warn<00:01:15.810> them

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
balance away and just try and warn them

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.940 
balance away and just try and warn them
up<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.380> mm-hmm

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
up really mm-hmm

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.230 
up really mm-hmm
so<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.760> looking<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so that's what you're looking for you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.219 
so that's what you're looking for you
looking<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> balance<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
looking for the balance and the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
looking for the balance and the
straightness<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> correctness<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
straightness and the correctness of the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
straightness and the correctness of the
leg<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.880> I've<00:01:20.970> noticed<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.420> few<00:01:21.450> times

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
leg because I've noticed a few times

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.090 
leg because I've noticed a few times
when<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.110> landed<00:01:22.440> you've<00:01:22.619> pull<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
when you landed you've pull up and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.469 
when you landed you've pull up and
actually<00:01:23.190> stop<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.030> were<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> doing

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
actually stop so what were you doing

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
actually stop so what were you doing
there<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.070> why<00:01:26.070> he's<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.850> landing

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
there and why he's just not landing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
there and why he's just not landing
correct<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> run<00:01:28.110> away<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.650> fence

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
correct one in a run away from the fence

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.859 
correct one in a run away from the fence
so<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.460> trying<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> put<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.630> bit<00:01:30.750> of
