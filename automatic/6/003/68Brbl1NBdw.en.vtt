and these do kind of smell a little bit

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.230 
and these do kind of smell a little bit
but<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:42.139> don't<00:04:42.889> know<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:43.310> not<00:04:43.430> horrid<00:04:43.880> but<00:04:44.090> it

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
but I don't know it's not horrid but it

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.770 
but I don't know it's not horrid but it
does<00:04:44.389> smell<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.630> little<00:04:44.780> bit<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:47.479> Sun<00:04:47.750> is

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
does smell a little bit and this Sun is

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.890 
does smell a little bit and this Sun is
blue<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:49.370> as<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.300> can<00:04:50.449> see<00:04:50.599> they<00:04:50.720> are<00:04:50.750> really

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
blue and as you can see they are really

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.730 
blue and as you can see they are really
thin<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.310> they<00:04:52.370> are<00:04:52.580> stacked<00:04:52.940> up<00:04:53.120> pretty<00:04:53.180> high

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
thin but they are stacked up pretty high

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.140 
thin but they are stacked up pretty high
so<00:04:54.740> they<00:04:54.860> should<00:04:55.039> last<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.610> little<00:04:55.729> while<00:04:55.970> I

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
so they should last a little while I

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.690 
so they should last a little while I
mean<00:04:56.510> I<00:04:56.750> hope<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:58.580> they<00:04:58.910> should

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.740 

and<00:05:02.240> then<00:05:02.360> we've<00:05:02.480> got<00:05:03.639> this<00:05:04.639> silver<00:05:05.240> again<00:05:05.540> it

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.870 
and then we've got this silver again it
is<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:07.280> I'm<00:05:07.370> counting<00:05:07.550> three<00:05:07.970> silvers<00:05:09.880> here's

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
gotta pull them off another silver but

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.490 
gotta pull them off another silver but
this<00:05:41.120> silver<00:05:41.450> seems<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.930> have<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.110> little<00:05:42.410> bit

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.120 
this silver seems to have a little bit
more<00:05:44.800> colored<00:05:45.800> sparkle<00:05:46.490> in<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:47.919> this<00:05:48.919> one's

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
more colored sparkle in it this one's

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.250 
more colored sparkle in it this one's
purple<00:05:50.320> but<00:05:51.320> with<00:05:51.470> sparkles<00:05:51.950> in<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:53.080> most<00:05:54.080> of

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
purple but with sparkles in it most of

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.870 
purple but with sparkles in it most of
these<00:05:54.350> do<00:05:54.650> have<00:05:54.680> sparkles<00:05:55.310> in<00:05:55.430> it<00:05:55.520> because<00:05:55.760> I

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
these do have sparkles in it because I

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.560 
these do have sparkles in it because I

this one's like holographic almost it's

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:11.739 
this one's like holographic almost it's
got<00:07:07.249> like<00:07:07.369> a<00:07:07.459> rainbow<00:07:07.699> effect<00:07:10.239> it's<00:07:11.239> just<00:07:11.509> a

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:11.749

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:22.279 
this is a basic holographic black and

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.239 
this is a basic holographic black and
the<00:07:22.969> last<00:07:23.179> one<00:07:23.419> is<00:07:23.689> like<00:07:23.749> this<00:07:24.259> Rose<00:07:24.589> Goldy

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:25.249 
the last one is like this Rose Goldy

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:28.600 
the last one is like this Rose Goldy
color<00:07:25.459> this<00:07:26.449> one's<00:07:26.629> really<00:07:26.809> pretty<00:07:26.979> but<00:07:27.979> yes

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
color this one's really pretty but yes

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.850 
color this one's really pretty but yes
so<00:07:29.209> that's<00:07:29.959> all<00:07:30.529> of<00:07:30.860> my<00:07:31.039> tapes<00:07:32.409> like<00:07:33.409> I<00:07:33.589> said

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:35.389 
they were only about eight or nine

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.159 
they were only about eight or nine
dollars<00:07:36.019> and<00:07:37.119> if<00:07:38.119> I<00:07:38.479> could<00:07:38.779> put<00:07:38.869> the<00:07:38.989> link

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.169 
dollars and if I could put the link
