00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
just wanted to make a quick video

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.860 
just wanted to make a quick video
demonstrating<00:00:04.680> how<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.400> trackpad<00:00:06.390> works<00:00:06.660> in

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
demonstrating how the trackpad works in

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.200 
demonstrating how the trackpad works in
general<00:00:07.410> so<00:00:08.130> I've<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.550> set<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> mouse

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
general so I've got it set up as a mouse

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.209 
general so I've got it set up as a mouse
right<00:00:09.480> now<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.530> as<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.920> see<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.190> just

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
right now and so as you can see I'm just

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.740 
right now and so as you can see I'm just
moving<00:00:11.460> around<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.360> move<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> mouse

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
moving around and I can move the mouse

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.230 
moving around and I can move the mouse
around<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.349> use<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.910> button<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> right

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
around I can use the button on the right

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.890 
around I can use the button on the right
trigger<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.929> select<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:17.760> left<00:00:18.300> trigger<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
trigger to select the left trigger as a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.540 
trigger to select the left trigger as a
right<00:00:19.289> click<00:00:19.520> which<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.699> might<00:00:21.180> seem<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.960> verse

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
right click which is might seem in verse

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
right click which is might seem in verse
to<00:00:23.550> begin<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.210> does<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.170> get

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
to begin with but it does you do get

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.370 
to begin with but it does you do get
used<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> quite<00:00:25.769> quickly<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:27.019> overall<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
used to it quite quickly the overall it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.839 
used to it quite quickly the overall it
moves<00:00:28.560> quite<00:00:28.769> nicely<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.369> i<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.730> one

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
moves quite nicely so if i go from one

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
moves quite nicely so if i go from one
side<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> other<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> i

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
side to the other you can see that i

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.030 
side to the other you can see that i
have<00:00:32.360> no<00:00:33.360> matter<00:00:33.540> how<00:00:33.719> fast<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.010> should

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
have no matter how fast I go it should

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
have no matter how fast I go it should
be<00:00:35.460> approximately<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.360> same<00:00:36.480> distance<00:00:36.809> I'm

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
be approximately the same distance I'm

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
be approximately the same distance I'm
screwed<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.800> there<00:00:39.320> but<00:00:40.320> yeah<00:00:40.440> now<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
screwed that up there but yeah now the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
screwed that up there but yeah now the
one<00:00:41.940> thing<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.300> did<00:00:42.360> want<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> point<00:00:43.290> out

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
one thing that I did want to point out

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.799 
one thing that I did want to point out
that<00:00:43.800> i<00:00:44.070> hadn't<00:00:44.460> noticed<00:00:44.730> before<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that i hadn't noticed before is if you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.660 
that i hadn't noticed before is if you
notice<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.289> actually<00:00:46.920> moving<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.489> thumb

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
notice I'm not actually moving my thumb

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.930 
notice I'm not actually moving my thumb
yet<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.210> still<00:00:48.300> moving<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.870> down<00:00:48.960> so

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
yet it's still moving up and down so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.510 
yet it's still moving up and down so
when<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.590> when<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.680> started<00:00:53.190> using<00:00:53.340> this

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
when I when I first started using this

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.529 
when I when I first started using this
controller<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> didn't<00:00:54.059> even<00:00:54.149> notice<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
controller I didn't even notice that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.170 
controller I didn't even notice that
this<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.430> as<00:00:56.430> I've<00:00:56.699> started<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> play

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this was a thing as I've started to play

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
this was a thing as I've started to play
around<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> desktop<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
around with it more on the desktop I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.910 
around with it more on the desktop I
have<00:00:59.010> been<00:00:59.160> able<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.460> get<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.359> result<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.230> find

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
have been able to get this result I find

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
have been able to get this result I find
it<00:01:02.010> difficult<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.520> change<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.570> speed<00:01:03.809> because

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it difficult to change the speed because

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
it difficult to change the speed because
right<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.350> essentially<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
right now essentially if you're in the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.640 
right now essentially if you're in the
center<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.210> won't<00:01:06.420> happen<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.110> hold<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
center this won't happen so if I hold it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.320 
center this won't happen so if I hold it
right<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.210> going

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
right here or right here it's not going

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.149 
right here or right here it's not going
to<00:01:09.420> act<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.840> analog<00:01:10.140> stick<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.860> keep<00:01:11.070> on

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to act as an analog stick if I keep on

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.950 
to act as an analog stick if I keep on
moving<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.580> eventually<00:01:12.000> once<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
moving it out eventually once i get to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
moving it out eventually once i get to
this<00:01:13.520> border<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.750> um<00:01:16.820> there's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this border so if you can see um there's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.649 
this border so if you can see um there's
that<00:01:18.570> second<00:01:19.320> ring<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.430> i'm<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.299> i'm<00:01:21.479> at

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that second ring and if i'm on if i'm at

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.230 
that second ring and if i'm on if i'm at
the<00:01:21.780> edge<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.229> ring<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> i<00:01:23.670> can't<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the edge of that ring and i can't do it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.649 
the edge of that ring and i can't do it
with<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.810> fingers<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.680> thumb

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
with all of my fingers I need my thumb

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.910 
with all of my fingers I need my thumb
but<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> edge<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.590> ring

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
but if I get to the edge of that ring

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.300 
but if I get to the edge of that ring
then<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:29.880> start<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> move<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
then it will start to move out now it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
then it will start to move out now it
seems<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.850> seems<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.170> different

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
seems to go seems to go with different

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
seems to go seems to go with different
speeds<00:01:34.799> based<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:36.150> too<00:01:36.299> close<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
speeds based on how far too close to the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
speeds based on how far too close to the
edge<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.200> am<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.829> isn't<00:01:38.159> particularly

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
edge I am this isn't particularly

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.830 
edge I am this isn't particularly
comfortable<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> way<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:39.810> now

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
comfortable the way about it right now

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.679 
comfortable the way about it right now
but<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.439> does<00:01:40.590> seem<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> across<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
but it does seem to get it across the

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.580 
but it does seem to get it across the
two<00:01:42.689> want<00:01:42.990> from<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.229> end<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> other

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
two want from one end to the other

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.370 
two want from one end to the other
faster<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.970> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> using<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> mix<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
faster so it's kind of using a mix of an

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.179 
faster so it's kind of using a mix of an
analog<00:01:46.799> system<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.790> one-to-one<00:01:48.689> system

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
analog system and a one-to-one system

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.510 
analog system and a one-to-one system
now<00:01:50.240> I'm<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.509> sure<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.780> many<00:01:51.840> games<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
now I'm not sure how many games this is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.209 
now I'm not sure how many games this is
useful<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.350> what<00:01:55.350> i'm<00:01:55.439> using<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.799> playing<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
useful in what i'm using a playing a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.859 
useful in what i'm using a playing a
first<00:01:56.399> person<00:01:56.520> shooter<00:01:56.670> generally<00:01:57.299> it's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
first person shooter generally it's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.740 
first person shooter generally it's
faster<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.439> me<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.610> swing<00:02:00.390> from<00:02:00.600> one

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
faster for me to just swing from one

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
faster for me to just swing from one
side<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> other<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.189> i<00:02:02.219> can

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
side to the other as you can see i can

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
side to the other as you can see i can
do<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.880> quickly<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.840> i<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
do that really quickly but if i go to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.210 
do that really quickly but if i go to
the<00:02:05.100> far<00:02:05.460> edge<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:07.079> consistent<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:08.099> me

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the far edge it's not consistent for me

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
the far edge it's not consistent for me
which<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.789> why<00:02:09.000> I've<00:02:09.209> never<00:02:09.420> been<00:02:09.599> using<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
which is why I've never been using this

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.140 
which is why I've never been using this
and<00:02:10.259> honestly<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.550> first<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.879> thought<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.060> was

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and honestly at first I thought it was

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.930 
and honestly at first I thought it was
kind<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.510> bug

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
kind of a bug

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.130 
kind of a bug
could<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.330> at<00:02:13.420> all<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:13.840> I've<00:02:14.020> been

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
could get it at all but as I've been

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.260 
could get it at all but as I've been
using<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.500> controller<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.250> am<00:02:15.700> able<00:02:15.970> to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
using the controller more I am able to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.260 
using the controller more I am able to
mimic<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.140> behavior<00:02:17.620> more<00:02:17.830> frequently<00:02:18.460> but

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
mimic this behavior more frequently but

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.540 
mimic this behavior more frequently but
I<00:02:19.540> still<00:02:19.990> don't<00:02:20.440> feel<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.010> use<00:02:21.340> this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
I still don't feel like I can use this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.460 
I still don't feel like I can use this
reliably<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.600> first-person<00:02:22.960> shooter<00:02:23.260> or

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
reliably in a first-person shooter or

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.560 
reliably in a first-person shooter or
pretty<00:02:23.710> much<00:02:23.770> any<00:02:24.070> other<00:02:24.130> game<00:02:24.460> maybe<00:02:25.450> if

pretty much any other game maybe if

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.260 
pretty much any other game maybe if
you're<00:02:25.720> really<00:02:25.960> close<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.440> something<00:02:26.650> it's

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
you're really close to something it's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.630 
you're really close to something it's
maybe<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.360> slower<00:02:28.750> alternative<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:30.100> moving<00:02:30.460> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
maybe a slower alternative to moving the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.060 
maybe a slower alternative to moving the
cursor<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.060> small<00:02:31.450> distance<00:02:31.960> but<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.620> still<00:02:32.920> find

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
cursor a small distance but I still find

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.520 
cursor a small distance but I still find
that<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> cursor<00:02:33.610> over<00:02:33.850> all<00:02:34.090> I'm<00:02:34.480> able<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.960> box

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
that the cursor over all I'm able to box

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.620 
that the cursor over all I'm able to box
things<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.220> starcraft<00:02:36.670> fairly<00:02:37.150> effectively

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
things in starcraft fairly effectively

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.080 
things in starcraft fairly effectively
if<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.650> watch<00:02:38.800> my<00:02:38.830> first<00:02:39.550> starcraft<00:02:39.790> video

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
if you watch my first starcraft video

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.360 
if you watch my first starcraft video
the<00:02:40.780> gameplay<00:02:41.050> isn't<00:02:41.350> all<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.500> great<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:41.980> i

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the gameplay isn't all that great and i

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.440 
the gameplay isn't all that great and i
don't<00:02:42.550> use<00:02:42.640> any<00:02:42.670> hot<00:02:43.000> keys<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.300> i<00:02:43.360> do

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
don't use any hot keys but i do

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.440 
don't use any hot keys but i do
demonstrate<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.860> cursor<00:02:45.730> movement<00:02:46.300> is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
demonstrate that the cursor movement is

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.510 
demonstrate that the cursor movement is
quite<00:02:46.900> nice<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.440> i'm<00:02:47.920> able<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.400> get

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
quite nice and i'm able to get

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.400 
quite nice and i'm able to get

this analog movement i'm not sure how

this analog movement i'm not sure how
useful<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.770> will<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.340> day-to-day

it<00:02:57.610> out<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.910> let<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.210> guys<00:02:58.360> know<00:02:58.710> kind<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.830> how

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it out and let you guys know kind of how

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.820 
it out and let you guys know kind of how
the<00:03:00.040> analog<00:03:00.690> experience<00:03:01.690> works<00:03:01.990> out<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.560> the

the analog experience works out of the

the analog experience works out of the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
that haven't been designed with it in

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.920 
that haven't been designed with it in
mind<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.980> all<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.480> games<00:03:28.660> I've<00:03:28.900> played

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
mind and in all of the games I've played

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.560 
mind and in all of the games I've played
thus<00:03:29.320> far<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.739> have<00:03:30.070> not<00:03:30.100> found<00:03:30.459> any<00:03:30.730> benefit<00:03:31.360> of

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
thus far I have not found any benefit of

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.380 
thus far I have not found any benefit of
using<00:03:31.989> this<00:03:32.290> I'll<00:03:33.190> report<00:03:33.790> back<00:03:33.880> once<00:03:34.209> i<00:03:34.330> do

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
using this I'll report back once i do

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.150 
using this I'll report back once i do
and<00:03:34.840> i'll<00:03:35.140> certainly<00:03:35.410> mention<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:35.860> in<00:03:35.980> any

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and i'll certainly mention it in any

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.370 
and i'll certainly mention it in any
videos<00:03:36.370> where<00:03:36.700> i<00:03:36.730> an't<00:03:37.030> find<00:03:37.510> myself<00:03:37.690> actively

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
videos where i an't find myself actively

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.550 
videos where i an't find myself actively
using<00:03:38.980> this<00:03:39.310> technique<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:41.170> now<00:03:41.260> i<00:03:41.290> just

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
using this technique but for now i just

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.500 
using this technique but for now i just
wanted<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.769> point<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> out<00:03:42.550> make<00:03:43.209> sure<00:03:43.239> that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
wanted to point it out make sure that

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.270 
wanted to point it out make sure that
everybody<00:03:43.690> knows<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.739> exists<00:03:45.130> that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
everybody knows that it exists that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.580 
everybody knows that it exists that
you're<00:03:45.430> aware<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.200> works<00:03:47.350> in<00:03:47.500> any

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
you're aware of it that it works in any

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.930 
you're aware of it that it works in any
direction<00:03:47.800> not<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.310> left<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.550> right<00:03:48.670> just

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
direction not just left and right just

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.830 
direction not just left and right just
in<00:03:49.180> case<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.959> was<00:03:50.080> unclear<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.910> hope<00:03:52.720> you

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
live streaming in the future um I've

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.350 
live streaming in the future um I've
been<00:04:02.830> having<00:04:03.430> some<00:04:03.610> stuttering<00:04:03.970> issues<00:04:04.209> with

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
been having some stuttering issues with

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.780 
been having some stuttering issues with
my<00:04:04.480> video<00:04:05.350> setup<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.860> I'm<00:04:06.310> sure<00:04:06.340> you're<00:04:06.730> all

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
my video setup as I'm sure you're all

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.479 
my video setup as I'm sure you're all
very<00:04:06.970> aware<00:04:07.630> but<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.650> think<00:04:09.040> I've<00:04:09.160> sorted<00:04:09.430> it

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
very aware but I think I've sorted it

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.360 
very aware but I think I've sorted it
all<00:04:09.580> out<00:04:09.640> i<00:04:09.790> think<00:04:09.970> my<00:04:10.709> card<00:04:11.709> was<00:04:11.830> overheating

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
all out i think my card was overheating

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.870 
all out i think my card was overheating
so<00:04:12.940> I've<00:04:13.560> reworked<00:04:14.560> my<00:04:14.769> whole<00:04:15.070> cooling<00:04:15.550> system

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
so I've reworked my whole cooling system

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.940 
so I've reworked my whole cooling system
for<00:04:16.060> my<00:04:16.120> computer<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.660> hopefully<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.799> will

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
for my computer and hopefully that will

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.220 
for my computer and hopefully that will
have<00:04:18.130> sorted<00:04:18.430> everything<00:04:18.519> out<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.510> hope<00:04:20.019> you

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
have sorted everything out so I hope you

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.080 
have sorted everything out so I hope you
