00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:21.800
Domini regit me.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.800
The Lord is my shepherd

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.600
therefore can I lack nothing.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.010
He shall feed me in a green pasture

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.100
and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.210
He shall convert my soul

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.310
and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.700
for his Name's sake.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.100
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.000
I will fear no evil

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.600
for thou art with me;

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.100
thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.610
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.600
thou hast anointed my head with oil,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.610
and my cup shall be full.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:52.910
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:03.700
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.310
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.510
and to the Holy Ghost

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.710
As it was in the beginning, is now,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.700
and ever shall be

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.410
world without end,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.410
Amen
