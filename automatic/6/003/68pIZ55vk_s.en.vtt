00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.820
 Hi there, I'm a developer of bunevs 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.050
 max facial animation system 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.280
 and now I want to show you the main 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.469
 basic features 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.229
 in version 2 7 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.309
 rendered communication and 2 7 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 which by the way is free free 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.279
 for all 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980
 Here I have a model 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 the girl by the way is the one who sings 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.720
 this is all we do not eat 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 I will work with him now 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 only first you need 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 check this model on 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.080
 the presence of jambs 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.780
 i.e 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.240
 all the excess will be fine and we will not 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240
 not primary class belts in particular 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.390
 so modifiers 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 not everything is fine 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.240
 no 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.400
 there are no extra skins 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.360
 scaling 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 100 percent on all axes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.420
 and there should be no modifiers 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.650
 plates that is a modifier which 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 in italics it means that it is imposed more 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.500
 than on one object 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 In particular, it happens that on the finger 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.790
 modifier on the eyes and on the street 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.240
 that is, we do not have such a thing by the way local 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.760
 eye area 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.230
 and looks 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.130
 but users 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 it's okay too 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.470
 we have an Inteco bill model 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.750
 hid shibaye ped 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.410
 I guess we hide him until we 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.260
 will need 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.310
 you can not run it 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.940
 releasing 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.770
 there is a toolbar 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 hospital st main window is called 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 but how would 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 recruit a goal 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.060
 show eyes 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.000
 left right 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.370
 and still need to show language 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.770
 Generally speaking for Monya Faiz and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.550
 just enough 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.920
 the four objects of the head vowel language 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.009
 I still have here 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.859
 there are 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.859
 so Iâ€™m going to highlight 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.219
 and now language 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 tongue but there was hiding his teeth 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.929
 when u choose language 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.249
 I'll tell you a few words now 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.499
 future holiday 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.399
 from for language are created two with 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:33.249
 by half 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.809
 on one central 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.809
 this 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.439
 in terms of which the future will go 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.469
 control 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.959
 and not a side slider that will 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.049
 subsequently determine 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.049
 shell sizes skins forehead that is 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.199
 That's why to adjust these dimensions 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.049
 easy enough 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.779
 move these points here 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.809
 he roughly indicate external 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.829
 contours externally lateral contours of the tongue 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.319
 the greatest interest is not needed 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.359
 still there is a plan laid hiding points of the furnace 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.809
 pricing at subject level 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.809
 here is the one to demand 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.389
 so show the language back 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.229
 in England 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.479
 Well, everything is now possible 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.789
 create 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.359
 in terms of a new model 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.269
 still touching slides 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.039
 we have 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.589
 This is a row of buttons all in terms of McMaster 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:47.279
 your message first on the buttons 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.549
 first third plains second 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.600
 peak splice 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.019
 profile 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.440
 what is the difference 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.850
 button korean plan th is created by plan y 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.640
 models are trying to fit and 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.569
 lead the character that is she 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.169
 creak trying 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.429
 find her characters head her to this place 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.919
 just in terms of model limits 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.109
 but more or less from scale as 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.299
 once thought 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.449
 and the second button is just with a flame 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.519
 loaded 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.250
 and with those coordinates that are already recorded 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.970
 snap off and fit second 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.550
 button is used when you have it already 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.469
 ready spline new model for chapter 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.930
 and you want to download it immediately 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.490
 visitors would be valid if you 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.999
 want you to eat 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:33.640
 file worries that 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.650
 manually customized abbot 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.479
 here you go 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.740
 perhaps 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.740
 run down flame race 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.659
 now 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.529
 when maksat forester we will see 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.969
 with a planned English 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.599
 you are welcome 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.610
 because as you can see the script instilled his head 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.389
 and approximately 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.589
 from Kiev 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.339
 in terms of the model 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.539
 pan place where it should be 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.680
 these are big 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 in the yellow spline is scaled 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.430
 but stable sixers half 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.999
 and move 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.930
 respectively 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.930
 and a little bit more padrino 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.330
 I will not tell further 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.349
 I can only move over so that 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:37.639
 in terms of 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.499
 not badly failed 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.149
 in the model on whose then it will be very hard 

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:44.689
 allocate 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.689
 I probably because it again 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.879
 like this 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:54.969
 so in what 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.939
 what tricks we have in terms of 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.909
 models 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.529
 First of all 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:01.990
 she is symmetrical 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.509
 At the moment 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.439
 that country on which the control is yellow 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.439
 she rules another country with red control 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.599
 if i flipped our plan 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.550
 second trick 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.060
 it does not stand out itself in half given and 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.380
 4control is made for the convenience of all 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.039
 layers 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.719
 way done 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.219
 that then these controls could immediately 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.300
 move 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.349
 but his case was highlighted 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.429
 moving my opposite 

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:35.419
 the side is moving too 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.840
 that is, it is currently believed that 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.840
 model pricing is completely symmetrical 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:44.110
 but now we will align in terms of 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.779
 over the head 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.499
 using the new jazz flange window 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.439
 which will be described next role
