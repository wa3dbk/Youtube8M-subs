00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 And now I will talk about 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 various items that are applied 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 when playing 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.219
 blues and jazz particular first 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.920
 talk about chords if we are classics 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.830
 know chord has komi 3 steady 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.039
 sound house salt how do you get greedy 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.340
 and court by over the settings of the same little body 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:33.230
 and further and further and all you can get 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.230
 chord all sounds maximum code 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.530
 because in the classics we spoke first 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.340
 3 5 are what's what sounds when we 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.860
 add here still get mesh 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.489
 we then it turns out but on stream and so 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.829
 further here is why you first need it 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.000
 see potency in any chord at all 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.699
 in order to learn 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.129
 if you apply apply so after all 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.050
 formed the end of a second and me for 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.119
 order to know its main view or 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.429
 you need him back potency 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.170
 classic for russian and under 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:15.520
 chords are very difficult therefore they are played 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.590
 pass separately as Prague are sound 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.980
 or let's say there if itâ€™s a fact 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.390
 plays 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.390
 this 11 turns out let's talk about but not 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 that means how will I be located 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.170
 gonna play chords i take you here 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170
 major 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 it turns out extremely distance 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.420
 up to a second it is but not called 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.000
 Now I want to say about the location 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.470
 same map 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.850
 let's say it can take a position 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.830
 pepper 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.900
 assumption septim and 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.990
 all night his one 2 sounds 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:11.030
 I 4 these two positions are very convenient for 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.030
 implementations can be here you apply 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.349
 Now we will show pharma quarrel 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.150
 here's a chord I want to say for recordings 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.400
 chord and apply encryption what is it 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.700
 it means we do not write classics 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.420
 chord name here we write 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.659
 with Latin letters 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.500
 fools built sets center e ra 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:36.489
 so f is a fact this case is a chord 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 from note fa 9 is the main court and 6 there 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.950
 still instead of twin you are septima 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.950
 text here it means 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.040
 but if you try here is the kind of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.090
 96 are written for an example but I 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.410
 now the location of the third and now 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.900
 here and so these two locations need 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.640
 memorize and any jazz complex stake 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.830
 it becomes easier too you know everything 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.620
 two layout need to play for their 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.960
 implementation and for the accompaniment of blues 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.390
 now how these chords are played 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.740
 they play by repeating the right hand can 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.280
 be pass 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.930
 chord not melody upper fingers or 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.930
 a separate chord is played without bass 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.170
 such a reception is then if you will 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.900
 play on the digitization which I will say later 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.900
 you will play just bass melody 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.880
 that is, everyone needs to study or not 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.520
 separate bass able to build 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.640
 able to against the hordes 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.620
 the asset and the bass follows the same and who 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.380
 can no longer because the elements are not 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.340
 need to know and without it is impossible 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.070
 will play a single improvisation 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.660
 recalling what are the intervals 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.870
 intervals is called the distance between 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.620
 sounds two sounds he begins with 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.330
 intervals of seconds to the nearest 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.330
 then she knew how to end 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.800
 need to study well in music theory 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.770
 classical intervals are the same 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.240
 spacing apply jazz absolutely 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.690
 classic intervals no name is there 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.180
 no 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.000
 music theory learn no longer happen and 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.919
 large small size mishon and first 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.710
 just the concept of information about remind 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.590
 distance I can say again that 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.540
 in the arrangement of jazz cord 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.540
 present we have arranged 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.479
 This is the sofa arrangement for me dancing and 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.020
 and so 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.480
 I'll paint the left 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.880
 its location is not worth it and rationally 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.240
 play with location exercises 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.240
 fifths 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.920
 because two locations are very good 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.110
 ok them me 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.820
 we change one chord inflammation per 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.830
 the other is in the price position 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.830
 conveniently technical prior to enthronement 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.370
 will continue to apply all 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.370
 spacing
