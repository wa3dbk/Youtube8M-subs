00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.390
 it was the same with me earlier 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.029
 either on airlines wall or he goalkeeper for him quite simply 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 If you have Pauline Schneider you have a greater chance that the ball goes in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 one would have only pressed the final phase 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.880
 you can bet on in Top Spin the ball will go over the wall into the goal 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.879
 hammers 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.130
 but it is best for users to have both the clubs and the schools 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 and that's how it looks like 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 In such a position you should only pass on the short corner 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.140
 it could look like that if you move to the country 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.620
 if you shoot with your left foot 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
 since you try to bring the ball in the short corner 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.640
 Another option is the semi-trailer 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.460
 the goalkeeper in principle has to protect only the first one who the second man 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.670
 Ball from the Interreg IV 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 Goalkeeper is surprised and usually reacts too late 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 Of course you can also strap on the ball here 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.700
 if the first shooter deceives, the wall jumps up 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.990
 then the second man shoots when the wall comes back and takes 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.509
 but the goalkeeper is usually already correct 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.509
 but not always 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.159
 how about just surround the wall 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.169
 You pass a wall and you can go straight to 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.169
 most of the time it is in there 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.139
 Shooting such a goal is very difficult 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.139
 I have a lot of attempts there he is finally wanted to land on the net 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.829
 it is not really recommended 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.879
 because you can just accept the ball and then deduct it 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.449
 this variant is my favorite 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.189
 you simply lay the ball on it and take on a man and the fighters on 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.129
 the rise of the two rows 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.919
 what are you risking at just under 40 meters? 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.349
 "Our envoy once sought to deduct rules directly from the model 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.729
 with luck into the goal 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.669
 so the wars already 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.919
 I helped this video by using free kicks 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.049
 now comes a little hint in the report 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.819
 you can always go on a training tour anyway 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.299
 Train free kicks 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.259
 so you come across resistance 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.939
 throw him 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.289
 Game setting 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.289
 the running scene Aurelio changes 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.419
 sometimes players also apply yes 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.369
 and because position free kick offensive 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:12.010
 DUH you have a wrong game on the 7 at the beginning of the game 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.730
 if you do not clean it 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.170
 or once again made easy the players start and you're back 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:18.840
 let's start
