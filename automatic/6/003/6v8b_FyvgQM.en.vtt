00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.179
 where I will make you discover the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.759
 tennis so tennis is a sport of 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.850
 racket that can be individual handsome 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.800
 collective so in the meetings 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.720
 sports with others are falling or for 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.029
 playing as a team where all alone in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 tournaments other than with your club 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.660
 it depends if you want to do it 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.439
 competition and this is in any case for 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.390
 beginners I will make you 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:38.219
 discover the basics in three stages the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.590
 first step is your material to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:47.039
 choose so everything depends on your your 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 corpulence of your of your of your 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.530
 size of your weight not so much 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.570
 your weight but rather size 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 this is a racket must be chosen 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.649
 according to all that so if you are 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.629
 little was not going to take a racket 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.519
 Too big 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.119
 of course there are several types of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.250
 racket 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.549
 the junior snowshoes for the for the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 children a mere 9 to 12 children from 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.650
 12 years old up to 12 years old and frey at layrac 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.890
 and adults have like this it's 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 normal adults who makes 260 285 grams 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.500
 i do not know so much my 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 goal and a racket 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 pretty good enough for the hitters 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 this one finally you I advise you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.759
 to go and see your store and you 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.570
 advise 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.759
 ask a seller to make you 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 try snowshoes must be 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.149
 well you help yourself in any case do not 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.579
 do not take the cheapest there 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.110
 range like the arts tengo costs 30 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.540
 euros but if we grammon for 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.220
 in my view so take it well 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.970
 really snowshoes that are you 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.380
 advised or snowshoes at cost 180 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.729
 euros directly if you are a beginner 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.069
 a voice just a good racket but 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.640
 at least they cost we counted 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.840
 between 80 and 100 euros even maybe ya 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.590
 racket debate that can be found at 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.540
 60 euros or less 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.090
 possible so go to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.280
 stores and asked what we 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.430
 you what we advise you 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.600
 advise and after make your choice 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.040
 with all these professions 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.050
 second very important point these are 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.950
 your outfits 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.150
 so I advise you it's 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.819
 really the most important to take a 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.160
 cat take a shock because did not take 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.470
 no nice or even slope 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.930
 courcelles it's really it's one for 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.420
 a night finally it's not that it's 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.100
 rotten but you will not feel 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.989
 comfortable do you want to be bad 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.440
 when you go running fall is 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.820
 really shirts this is really the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 basis the base of two begin to 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.799
 getting dressed and taking shorts 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.799
 here and a t-shirt after the tee shirts 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.209
 and definitely less important finally 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.609
 all the t-shirts are going well and the pc 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.989
 to take polyester or cotton what 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.760
 whether it's cotton glue when you 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.200
 not sweat so 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.940
 see polyester is really 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.820
 Suitable for the sport I 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.350
 sweat etc 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.660
 so that's really very important 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.500
 to choose a good dress 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.530
 also the shoes 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 take good tennis shoes by 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.329
 shoes running shoes 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.500
 of and it's true but the ones 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:53.450
 suitable shoes for that I you 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.720
 also advise to ask the seller 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.000
 who will be as good at explaining you as 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.120
 it will be necessary if it will be necessary 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.860
 choose advise etc are ready 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.750
 well that's all for this second point 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.940
 is the last point that's the point 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.110
 practice so that's when you go 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.190
 play so here I did you a 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.269
 sketch a tennis court 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.440
 so I'll explain a little to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:27.500
 what serve each part so on the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.020
 two sides here here and here you have them 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.000
 two double lanes we know you 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.770
 hallways are only for the game in 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.400
 double when you will have two one two 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.810
 against two these are the only times where 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.120
 you can use them if not in 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 simple if the ball falls into one of these 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.830
 20 of his runners 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.460
 the ball is foul as we say if she 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.870
 touch the lines 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.250
 it is good then there are the 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.360
 grounds from baseline when he talks 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.760
 bottom line 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.030
 so these lines there are the lines where 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.289
 you must serve firstly you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.610
 must you have no right to 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:11.289
 touch with your foot when you 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:14.800
 serve this line then if the ball 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.180
 if the ball falls behind this line 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.349
 it will be fault so you win the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.280
 point on the other hand if it touches the line 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.440
 this ball will be validated and will be good 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:32.389
 so it works on both sides of course 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:35.720
 for each player then 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:38.539
 mecary so that's called the squares of 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.490
 service since this is where we go 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.560
 serve when you serve you know 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.020
 always unstoppable you go from 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.449
 all today on the right 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.400
 we serve you here in gones in this 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:54.320
 square then you have right to serve 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.620
 that in the rectangle part here well 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.070
 sure dummies against like everywhere and so 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.410
 you put here for example here or 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.949
 in the net laval will fault you 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.830
 will have a second chance to 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:11.030
 succeed in continuing the point if both 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.010
 bullets are foul we call that a 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.120
 double fault and it's the opponent who 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.530
 get the point then 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.600
 see service if you put one of your 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.150
 2 1 of your service in the square you 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.800
 can play freely 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.669
 you can play freely the first 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.560
 who is doing their fault 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.220
 take stock and count the points 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.100
 2.15 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:38.910
 do not talk about 15 we count 00 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.910
 then it's 15-0 30-0 40-0 and I 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.930
 always the score of the one who serves in 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.780
 first 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.669
 so after if it's 15 08 15 to 6 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.669
 the other one wins one point we win 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.970
 1.16 servat by winning our 30 15 30 to 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.330
 if he gets to 1.66 and serves him in iron 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.850
 etc. 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:03.699
 here and there and then and that's it 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.960
 near everything so at each point at each 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.880
 every point play you change to for 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.250
 serve when you played this point there 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.639
 it is finished you place your hand you 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.979
 serve here and then you can play 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.590
 the bro and of course not in the hallways 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.570
 if the ball falls off the court 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:23.110
 she will be foul or in the net too 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:26.080
 concluded net the elite ci quote in the 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.240
 net of course it will be foul and that's 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.620
 who happens to line up two sets 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.450
 normally six games so normally 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.900
 when you are when you have more than 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:46.210
 14 years 13 14 years I do not think even 12 13 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:47.889
 years 11/12 you have you here finally 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.180
 what times there are limits for 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:53.229
 very small but that's for the most 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:56.370
 little brothers here it was so I was you 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:59.530
 I discovered a little tennis 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.150
 what it takes what it takes 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.340
 must adapt what to buy this 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.110
 what is needed then there is Lebanese 

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.930
 frankly I taught you the basics 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.940
 we see it was really it's a 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.900
 technical video 

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.590
 I hope you enjoyed it and we 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.590
 says nothing else hi
