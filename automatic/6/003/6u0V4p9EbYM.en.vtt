now<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.630> particular<00:00:21.779> car<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> first

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
now this particular car was the first

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.910 
now this particular car was the first
year<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> new<00:00:24.600> engine<00:00:24.930> formula<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
year for a new engine formula so this

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.269 
year for a new engine formula so this
would<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.189> been<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> brand<00:00:26.609> new<00:00:26.760> car<00:00:27.000> 1938

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it's had a supercharged v12 which would

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
it's had a supercharged v12 which would
have<00:00:32.279> called<00:00:32.489> by<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.730> regulations<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.690> a

the<00:00:42.090> engine's<00:00:42.390> offset<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.489> side<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the engine's offset to one side so that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.950 
the engine's offset to one side so that
the<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.079> drive<00:00:46.469> shafts<00:00:46.829> allowed<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the the drive shafts allowed them to

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
the the drive shafts allowed them to
pass<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.700> left<00:00:50.700> side<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> driver<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
pass on the left side of the driver so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.689 
pass on the left side of the driver so
he<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.410> sit<00:00:52.620> lower<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> car<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.520> better

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
he can sit lower in the car for better

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.979 
he can sit lower in the car for better
streamlining<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.170> got<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> five-speed

transaxle in the back even though it's a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.240 
transaxle in the back even though it's a
front<00:00:59.940> engine<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> gearbox<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
front engine so it's a gearbox and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
front engine so it's a gearbox and
differential<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.430> back<00:01:02.789> has<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> diol

semi-independent type of suspension

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.740 
semi-independent type of suspension
which<00:01:09.960> means<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.409> got<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.860> both<00:01:11.549> both<00:01:12.000> wheels

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
which means it's got a both both wheels

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
which means it's got a both both wheels
are<00:01:12.930> connected<00:01:13.439> together<00:01:13.680> by<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.640> hollow

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
the back we can see this dr rear that we

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.479 
the back we can see this dr rear that we
talked<00:03:48.269> about<00:03:48.420> earlier<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.040> big<00:03:50.250> pipe

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
talked about earlier it's that big pipe

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.460 
talked about earlier it's that big pipe
right<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:50.970> middle<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.299> just<00:03:51.470> connect

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
right in the middle that just connect

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.080 
right in the middle that just connect
had<00:03:52.620> no<00:03:52.769> driveline<00:03:53.220> components<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:53.970> it

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
had no driveline components in that it

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.390 
had no driveline components in that it
just<00:03:54.239> connected<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> two<00:03:54.860> wheels<00:03:55.860> together

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
just connected the two wheels together

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.460 
just connected the two wheels together
and<00:03:57.269> now<00:03:57.450> if<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:57.570> look<00:03:57.810> up<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.989> little<00:03:58.170> closer

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
and now if we look up a little closer

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.100 
and now if we look up a little closer
maybe<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.190> see<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.610> the<00:04:00.570> half<00:04:00.750> shafts

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
maybe we can see that the half shafts

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.660 
maybe we can see that the half shafts
with<00:04:01.410> independent<00:04:01.950> joints<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.340> actually

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
with independent joints that actually

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.130 
with independent joints that actually
came<00:04:02.850> out<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> gearbox<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.930> semi

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
came out of the gearbox so it's a semi

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.680 
came out of the gearbox so it's a semi
independent<00:04:04.880> suspension<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.370> side<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.600> I

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
independent suspension to the side and I

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.820 
independent suspension to the side and I
think<00:04:09.750> it's<00:04:09.959> kind<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.170> neat<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:10.620> see
