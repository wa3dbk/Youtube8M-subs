00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
going on on the other side of the map

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
going on on the other side of the map
such<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> big<00:01:04.890> map<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
such a big map that people kind of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.320 
such a big map that people kind of
wander<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.590> time<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> time

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
wander over here from time to time

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.350 
wander over here from time to time
you'll<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.540> random<00:01:10.790> people<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.119> there

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you'll get random people here and there

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.490 
you'll get random people here and there
and<00:01:13.640> all<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.450> takes<00:01:15.720> once<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.380> your

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and all it takes once you get your

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.499 
and all it takes once you get your
chopper<00:01:16.979> gunner<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.670> once<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.330> your

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
chopper gunner or once you get your

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
chopper gunner or once you get your
Harrier<00:01:19.409> strike<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:22.729> basically<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.090> only

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Harrier strike is basically you only

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
Harrier strike is basically you only
need<00:01:24.450> four<00:01:24.750> kills<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.400> don't

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
need four kills so if if they don't

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.749 
need four kills so if if they don't
shoot<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.920> right<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> slow<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.610> down

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
shoot it down right here I slow it down

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
shoot it down right here I slow it down
obviously<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.259> shoot<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> down

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
obviously if they don't shoot it down

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.020 
obviously if they don't shoot it down
you're<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> obviously<00:01:33.590> be<00:01:34.590> able<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> get

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you're going to obviously be able to get

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
you're going to obviously be able to get
your<00:01:36.119> chopper<00:01:36.540> gunner<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:37.140> quickly<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
your chopper gunner very quickly and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
your chopper gunner very quickly and
team<00:01:38.670> deathmatch<00:01:39.150> normally<00:01:39.720> something<00:01:40.229> like

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
team deathmatch normally something like

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
team deathmatch normally something like
this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:41.070> hard<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> pull<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.850> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
this is very hard to pull off it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.810 
this is very hard to pull off it's
easier<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.750> domination<00:01:43.290> obviously<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:46.820> right

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
easier in domination obviously but right

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.920
