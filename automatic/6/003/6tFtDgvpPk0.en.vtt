at once it locks up the center post
actually<00:01:16.560> removes<00:01:17.159> easily<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.630> can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually removes easily so that you can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950 
actually removes easily so that you can
latch<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.380> top<00:01:19.710> tray<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> bottom<00:01:21.270> case

latch the top tray to the bottom case

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
latch the top tray to the bottom case
and<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.710> becomes<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> tool<00:01:23.310> case<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and it becomes a tool case that you just

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
and it becomes a tool case that you just
simply<00:01:24.210> lift<00:01:25.049> through<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> handles<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.890> put

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
simply lift through the handles and put

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.429 
simply lift through the handles and put
in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> back<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.790> SUV<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.810> now

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
obviously it's going to weigh a lot with

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
obviously it's going to weigh a lot with
the<00:01:30.299> tools<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.750> no<00:01:30.869> big<00:01:31.079> deal<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.470> what's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the tools that's no big deal but what's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.950 
the tools that's no big deal but what's
it<00:01:31.770> weigh<00:01:31.939> without<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> toilet<00:01:33.390> empty<00:01:33.780> with

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it weigh without the toilet empty with

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.370 
it weigh without the toilet empty with
the<00:01:34.079> actuator<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.799> weighs<00:01:35.009> 83<00:01:35.520> pounds<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the actuator it weighs 83 pounds so it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
the actuator it weighs 83 pounds so it's
not<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> light<00:01:38.520> tool<00:01:38.869> but<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> a
