00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
um and as you can probably guess and if

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.640

any of you know me then you know you
could<00:02:14.860> probably<00:02:15.040> predict<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.940> what<00:02:16.150> I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
could probably predict it this is what I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.900 
could probably predict it this is what I
wanted<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.569> talk<00:02:16.780> about<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:18.069> there's<00:02:18.760> some

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
wanted to talk about and there's some

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.699 
wanted to talk about and there's some
crazy<00:02:19.120> statistic<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.140> remember<00:02:20.440> what<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.680> is

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
crazy statistic I remember what it is

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.070 
crazy statistic I remember what it is
but<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.370> think<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.849> was<00:02:21.970> something<00:02:22.599> like<00:02:22.630> maybe

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
but I think it was something like maybe

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.930 
but I think it was something like maybe
two<00:02:23.319> thirds<00:02:23.650> or<00:02:23.860> three<00:02:24.099> for<00:02:24.400> something<00:02:24.849> like

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
two thirds or three for something like

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.540 
two thirds or three for something like
that<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.599> very<00:02:26.230> high<00:02:26.770> percentage<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.430> men

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
that but a very high percentage of men

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.370 
that but a very high percentage of men
the<00:02:27.940> majority<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.510> men<00:02:28.750> who<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.170> mental

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
the majority of men who have mental

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.530 
the majority of men who have mental
health<00:02:29.590> never<00:02:30.130> never<00:02:30.730> tell<00:02:31.030> anybody<00:02:31.270> about

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
health never never tell anybody about

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.910 
health never never tell anybody about
their<00:02:31.870> entire<00:02:32.140> life<00:02:32.350> they<00:02:32.530> go<00:02:32.650> untreated

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
their entire life they go untreated

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.140 
their entire life they go untreated
