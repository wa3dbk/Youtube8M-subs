00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.190 

it's<00:00:06.470> such<00:00:06.590> a<00:00:06.620> unifying<00:00:07.190> question<00:00:08.200> whenever

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
it's such a unifying question whenever

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.539 
it's such a unifying question whenever
you've<00:00:09.410> been<00:00:09.620> on<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:09.829> subway<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:10.309> you<00:00:10.370> grab

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
you've been on the subway and you grab

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.369 
you've been on the subway and you grab
something<00:00:10.820> you're<00:00:11.059> like<00:00:11.150> oh<00:00:11.299> that's<00:00:11.480> wet<00:00:12.139> and

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
something you're like oh that's wet and

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.259 
something you're like oh that's wet and
why<00:00:12.469> is<00:00:12.530> that<00:00:12.650> wet<00:00:13.039> and<00:00:13.190> that's<00:00:13.280> weird<00:00:13.579> and<00:00:13.730> or

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
why is that wet and that's weird and or

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.699 
why is that wet and that's weird and or
you<00:00:14.360> sit<00:00:14.570> somewhere<00:00:14.839> in<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:14.990> seat<00:00:15.199> still<00:00:15.409> warm

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
you sit somewhere in the seat still warm

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.050 
you sit somewhere in the seat still warm
and<00:00:15.860> you<00:00:15.980> know<00:00:16.070> it's<00:00:16.219> just<00:00:16.369> warm<00:00:16.640> but<00:00:16.789> it<00:00:16.880> still

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
and you know it's just warm but it still

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.990 
and you know it's just warm but it still
feels<00:00:17.270> weird<00:00:17.570> I<00:00:18.220> think<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.490> interesting

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
feels weird I think the interesting

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.880 
feels weird I think the interesting
thing<00:00:20.179> is<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:20.359> people<00:00:20.750> base<00:00:21.050> their<00:00:21.080> fear<00:00:21.589> on

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
thing is that people base their fear on

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.200 
thing is that people base their fear on
ignorance<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:22.640> they<00:00:22.699> don't<00:00:22.849> know<00:00:22.970> what's

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
ignorance and they don't know what's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.669 
ignorance and they don't know what's
there<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:23.689> I<00:00:23.720> want<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:23.990> try<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.320> show<00:00:24.500> that

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
there and so I want to try and show that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.499 
there and so I want to try and show that
what's<00:00:24.830> there<00:00:25.039> is<00:00:25.189> mostly<00:00:26.000> what<00:00:26.210> you'll<00:00:26.330> find

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
what's there is mostly what you'll find

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.620 
what's there is mostly what you'll find
on<00:00:26.750> other<00:00:26.960> surfaces<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:28.550> petha<00:00:29.119> map<00:00:29.330> is<00:00:29.599> a

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
on other surfaces so petha map is a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.050 
on other surfaces so petha map is a
project<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.259> examine<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.099> longitudinal

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
project to examine the longitudinal

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.270 
project to examine the longitudinal
microbiome<00:00:32.840> or<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.350> bacteria<00:00:33.950> on<00:00:34.130> the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
microbiome or the bacteria on the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.760

surfaces<00:00:34.790> across<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.810> New<00:00:36.050> York<00:00:36.200> City<00:00:36.350> subway

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
surfaces across the New York City subway

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.500 
surfaces across the New York City subway
system<00:00:38.920> we<00:00:39.920> wanted<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.340> look<00:00:40.490> at<00:00:40.700> just<00:00:41.240> what's

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
system we wanted to look at just what's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.360 
system we wanted to look at just what's
there<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.930> no<00:00:42.170> one<00:00:42.350> really<00:00:42.500> knew<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.070> we<00:00:43.190> just

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
there and no one really knew so we just

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.400 
there and no one really knew so we just
started<00:00:43.640> swabbing<00:00:44.330> and<00:00:44.540> then<00:00:44.780> sequencing

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
started swabbing and then sequencing

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.100 
started swabbing and then sequencing
everything<00:00:45.710> we<00:00:45.830> could<00:00:45.980> see<00:00:46.570> we<00:00:47.570> did<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.780> Train

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
everything we could see we did the Train

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.620 
everything we could see we did the Train
and<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.130> two<00:00:49.340> places<00:00:49.640> at<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.000> station

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
and then two places at the station

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.960 
and then two places at the station
usually<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.080> bench<00:00:51.410> or<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.070> turnstiles<00:00:52.580> on<00:00:52.880> the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
usually a bench or the turnstiles on the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.830 
usually a bench or the turnstiles on the
garbage<00:00:53.330> cans<00:00:53.600> or<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.110> kiosk

this<00:00:56.350> covers<00:00:56.770> all<00:00:56.920> approximately<00:00:57.810> 656<00:00:58.810> miles

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
this covers all approximately 656 miles

all of the over 30,000 different sort of
turnstiles<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:07.990> real<00:01:08.590> goals<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.100> know

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
turnstiles one of the real goals to know

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.860 
turnstiles one of the real goals to know
very<00:01:09.280> well<00:01:09.640> what<00:01:09.880> baseline<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.479> normal<00:01:10.720> looks

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
very well what baseline and normal looks

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.570 
very well what baseline and normal looks
like<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:11.200> if<00:01:11.290> we<00:01:11.410> did<00:01:11.560> see<00:01:11.740> an<00:01:11.950> aberrant

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
like so if we did see an aberrant

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.090 
like so if we did see an aberrant
species<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:13.210> bacteria<00:01:13.690> we<00:01:13.990> could<00:01:14.229> know<00:01:14.800> that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
species or bacteria we could know that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.320 
species or bacteria we could know that
it<00:01:15.190> is<00:01:15.310> different<00:01:15.520> enough<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.850> be<00:01:16.119> able<00:01:16.180> to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
it is different enough to be able to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.469 
it is different enough to be able to
react<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.340> obvious<00:01:18.670> application

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
react to it but the obvious application

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.480 
react to it but the obvious application
of<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.290> would<00:01:20.410> be<00:01:20.500> provided<00:01:20.860> defense<00:01:21.130> or<00:01:21.310> just

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
of it would be provided defense or just

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.250 
of it would be provided defense or just
for<00:01:22.030> tracking<00:01:22.240> infectious<00:01:22.750> disease<00:01:23.050> could

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
for tracking infectious disease could

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.050 
for tracking infectious disease could
really<00:01:23.500> respond<00:01:23.860> quickly<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.460> potentially

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
really respond quickly and potentially

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.060 
really respond quickly and potentially
quarantine<00:01:25.720> an<00:01:25.930> area<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.590> prevent<00:01:26.920> other

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
quarantine an area to prevent other

quarantine an area to prevent other
people<00:01:27.130> from<00:01:27.280> getting<00:01:27.400> sick<00:01:27.580> not<00:01:28.180> only<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.420> the

city but also maybe airports places like
that<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:35.770> found<00:01:36.070> things<00:01:36.610> like<00:01:36.930> Enterococcus

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930

as things like staph and strep things

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.300 
as things like staph and strep things
that<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:44.380> normally<00:01:44.560> would<00:01:44.830> hear<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.130> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
that you normally would hear of and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.510 
that you normally would hear of and
think<00:01:45.490> oh<00:01:45.610> no<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:46.060> don't<00:01:46.690> want<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.340> we've<00:01:48.340> also

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
think oh no I don't want that we've also

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.370 
think oh no I don't want that we've also
seen<00:01:48.789> some<00:01:49.060> very<00:01:49.509> good<00:01:49.750> actors<00:01:50.170> like

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
seen some very good actors like

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.050 
seen some very good actors like
lactobacillus<00:01:51.160> type<00:01:51.490> strains<00:01:51.759> things<00:01:51.940> that

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
lactobacillus type strains things that

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.580 
lactobacillus type strains things that
you<00:01:52.119> would<00:01:52.210> find<00:01:52.240> in<00:01:52.690> yogurt<00:01:53.050> or<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.500> are

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
you would find in yogurt or that are

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.710 
you would find in yogurt or that are
normal<00:01:53.950> sort<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.190> bacteria<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:54.759> your<00:01:54.789> mouth<00:01:54.910> so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
normal sort of bacteria in your mouth so

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.999 
normal sort of bacteria in your mouth so
you<00:01:55.960> can<00:01:56.229> find<00:01:56.440> some<00:01:56.619> things<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.830> are<00:01:56.920> very

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
you can find some things that are very

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.950 
you can find some things that are very
very<00:01:57.310> good<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.000> things<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.300> could<00:01:58.810> be

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
very good and things that could be

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.860 
very good and things that could be
potentially<00:01:59.560> bad

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.660 

the<00:02:07.870> subway<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.440> mirror<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.160> humanities

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
the subway is a mirror of humanities

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.420 
the subway is a mirror of humanities
surfaces<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.020> there's<00:02:11.230> both<00:02:11.470> an<00:02:11.800> angel<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
surfaces so there's both an angel and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.630 
surfaces so there's both an angel and
demon<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.910> every<00:02:13.180> surface<00:02:14.520> somebody<00:02:15.520> gets

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
demon on every surface somebody gets

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.310 
demon on every surface somebody gets
cleaned<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.300> essentially<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.840> gets<00:02:17.020> washed

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
cleaned and essentially it gets washed

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.440 
cleaned and essentially it gets washed
away<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.310> it's<00:02:18.400> almost<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> forest<00:02:19.270> gets

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
away so it's almost like the forest gets

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.390 
away so it's almost like the forest gets
cleared<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.110> then<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.770> morning<00:02:20.980> commuters

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
cleared and then the morning commuters

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.590 
cleared and then the morning commuters
come<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.700> drop<00:02:21.850> their<00:02:22.030> seeds<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.450> by<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
come and drop their seeds and by the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.210 
come and drop their seeds and by the
afternoon<00:02:22.750> there's<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.410> whole<00:02:23.530> forest<00:02:23.860> again

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
