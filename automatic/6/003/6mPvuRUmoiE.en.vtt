playful

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
playful

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.160 
playful
I<00:03:23.819> wouldn't<00:03:24.819> change<00:03:25.030> anything<00:03:25.330> as<00:03:25.569> far<00:03:25.720> as<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
I wouldn't change anything as far as the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.430 
I wouldn't change anything as far as the
movie<00:03:26.500> goes<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:28.180> didn't<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.629> too<00:03:28.930> many<00:03:29.080> plans

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
movie goes we didn't have too many plans

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.410 
movie goes we didn't have too many plans
going<00:03:29.890> into<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.670> think<00:03:30.730> that's<00:03:31.209> the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
going into it and I think that's the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.119 
going into it and I think that's the
best<00:03:31.540> way<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> go<00:03:32.019> about<00:03:32.050> it<00:03:32.319> is<00:03:32.560> not<00:03:32.739> have<00:03:32.950> too

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
best way to go about it is not have too
