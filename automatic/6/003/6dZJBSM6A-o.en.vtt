get to see like ninety percent of the
game<00:02:08.560> actually<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.129> probably<00:02:09.340> don't<00:02:09.640> see<00:02:09.670> a

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
game actually you probably don't see a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.830

apply is that I almost always choose

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.030 
apply is that I almost always choose
recon<00:03:18.790> class<00:03:19.180> first<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.560> usually<00:03:20.889> my

recon class first and it's usually my

first bone whenever I get to a base and
that's<00:03:24.220> simply<00:03:25.030> for<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.299> purpose<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.690> laying

much more pressure on the enemy team
you're<00:03:38.950> going<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.190> give<00:03:39.340> your<00:03:39.760> team<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.690> better

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
able to break through the enemy lines so

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.120 
able to break through the enemy lines so
I<00:03:49.569> mean<00:03:49.780> who<00:03:50.019> wants<00:03:50.169> to<00:03:50.380> spawn<00:03:50.650> back<00:03:50.889> to<00:03:51.010> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
I mean who wants to spawn back to the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.819 
I mean who wants to spawn back to the
back<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.549> base<00:03:51.700> every<00:03:52.090> time<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.829> yes

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
back of the base every time and yes

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.490 
back of the base every time and yes
those<00:03:54.069> little<00:03:54.430> bars<00:03:55.209> there<00:03:55.540> do<00:03:55.840> stop<00:03:56.290> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
those little bars there do stop the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.920 
those little bars there do stop the
vehicles<00:03:56.919> apparently<00:03:57.459> took<00:03:58.450> me<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.660> little<00:03:58.810> bit

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
vehicles apparently took me a little bit

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.710 
vehicles apparently took me a little bit
all<00:03:59.680> right<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.010> now<00:04:00.190> we're<00:04:00.489> out<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:01.000> front<00:04:01.329> and

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
all right so now we're out in front and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.270 
all right so now we're out in front and
I'm<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.049> go<00:04:02.169> ahead<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.440> place<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.980> tugs

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
I'm going to go ahead and place and tugs

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.000 
I'm going to go ahead and place and tugs
and<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.819> radio<00:04:04.120> beacon<00:04:04.359> that<00:04:04.630> way<00:04:04.840> if<00:04:05.739> anybody

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and a radio beacon that way if anybody

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.210 
and a radio beacon that way if anybody
comes<00:04:06.280> near<00:04:06.430> by<00:04:06.669> hopefully<00:04:07.060> we<00:04:07.239> can<00:04:07.389> see<00:04:07.630> them

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
comes near by hopefully we can see them

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.430 
comes near by hopefully we can see them
but<00:04:09.220> I've<00:04:09.880> heard<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.299> many<00:04:10.389> people<00:04:10.810> kind<00:04:11.380> of

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
but I've heard so many people kind of

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.039 
but I've heard so many people kind of
bash<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.950> recon<00:04:12.730> class<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.299> say<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.870> they

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
bash the recon class and say that they

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.990 
bash the recon class and say that they
find<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.799> least<00:04:14.829> useful<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.730> I'm<00:04:15.819> like

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
find it the least useful and I'm like

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.120 
find it the least useful and I'm like
what<00:04:16.209> game<00:04:16.510> were<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.720> playing<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.919> radio

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
what game were you playing the radio

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.099 
what game were you playing the radio
beacon<00:04:18.760> is

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
beacon is

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.309 
beacon is
such<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.620> huge<00:04:21.459> part<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.569> game<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.080> just

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:23.319 
such a huge part of the game and I just

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.290 
such a huge part of the game and I just
don't<00:04:23.560> think<00:04:23.889> that<00:04:24.129> people<00:04:24.639> understand<00:04:25.150> that

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
don't think that people understand that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.140 
don't think that people understand that
yet<00:04:25.509> in<00:04:25.870> fact<00:04:26.229> I'll<00:04:26.949> probably<00:04:27.009> make<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.729> video<00:04:28.000> a

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
yet in fact I'll probably make a video a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.719 
yet in fact I'll probably make a video a
little<00:04:28.389> bit<00:04:28.599> later<00:04:28.810> stating<00:04:29.379> that<00:04:29.860> i<00:04:30.189> honestly

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
little bit later stating that i honestly

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.640 
little bit later stating that i honestly
believe<00:04:30.849> that<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.569> the<00:04:31.780> most<00:04:31.990> important

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
believe that it's the most important

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.800 
believe that it's the most important
tool<00:04:32.949> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.879> game<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.270> something<00:04:34.659> that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
tool in the game and something that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.980 
tool in the game and something that
everybody<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:36.759> know<00:04:36.789> should<00:04:37.389> try<00:04:37.629> out<00:04:37.659> at

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
everybody you know should try out at

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.899 
everybody you know should try out at
least<00:04:38.199> as<00:04:38.349> their<00:04:38.500> first<00:04:38.740> spawn<00:04:39.099> and<00:04:39.550> we'll<00:04:39.759> go

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
least as their first spawn and we'll go

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.499 
least as their first spawn and we'll go
over<00:04:39.939> a<00:04:40.449> lot<00:04:41.169> of<00:04:41.319> that<00:04:41.439> in<00:04:41.590> detail<00:04:42.240> right<00:04:43.240> here

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
over a lot of that in detail right here

over a lot of that in detail right here
I<00:04:43.539> was<00:04:43.900> lucky<00:04:44.289> because<00:04:44.439> I<00:04:44.680> had<00:04:45.069> my<00:04:45.370> buddy<00:04:45.580> mojo

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
I was lucky because I had my buddy mojo

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.779 
I was lucky because I had my buddy mojo
who<00:04:46.599> threw<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.050> smoke<00:04:47.469> who<00:04:48.009> helped<00:04:48.370> give<00:04:48.580> me

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
who threw in smoke who helped give me

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.640 
who threw in smoke who helped give me
cover<00:04:49.060> because<00:04:49.389> otherwise<00:04:49.780> up<00:04:50.169> those<00:04:50.439> guys

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
cover because otherwise up those guys

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.510 
cover because otherwise up those guys
probably<00:04:50.949> would<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.400> taken<00:04:51.610> me<00:04:51.849> out<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:53.520> can

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
probably would have taken me out I can

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.339 
probably would have taken me out I can
see<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.909> crate<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:55.840> it<00:04:55.990> makes<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.319> difficult

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
see the crate but it makes it difficult

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.409
