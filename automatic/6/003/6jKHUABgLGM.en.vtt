00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.090
 hello everyone welcome without the 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.859
 chain I am very happy with you 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.500
 find 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.799
 today I propose to you 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.230
 make 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.900
 roland a role on a command I have 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.419
 performed on the site pmu cosmetics 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.180
 so this is a site that is starting to be 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.950
 enough known still on the canvas is 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.309
 not bad on youtube etc 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.099
 so I made an order of 5 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:31.160
 lipsticks so this ski they do 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.380
 part of the professional range because 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.320
 this is a site that two kids range 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.289
 professional and the war one euro 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.870
 so this one is from the range to the 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.249
 professional range forgiveness so 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.949
 general for the site 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:49.249
 so my cosmetics is a site of 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.600
 makeup have to say cheap because " 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:54.530
 there are d there are very prices 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.219
 affordable and there even the quality ratio 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.229
 price is excellent at the delivery level 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.610
 so I ordered these students 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:07.490
 Tuesday night so here is Tuesday night 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.740
 around 7 pm something like that and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.560
 I received my order on Thursday morning 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 so it's super fast the cost of 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.690
 port are 5 euros and here are the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.330
 a few cents 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.850
 so frankly nothing to say about on the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.740
 delivery is well packed to me 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.450
 it was in a little box because 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.590
 here it was here were five projects it was 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.500
 it did not take too much space in a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.810
 little box not very big 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.480
 here is well packaged so really 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.370
 nothing to say about the speed of 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.200
 opportunities on product quality 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.460
 about quality in age and that's 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.810
 frankly nothing to say then es5 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.810
 lipstick that I took as I 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.729
 you said it's from the range of wings 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.530
 from there it's a new collection 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.220
 of lipsticks from the range 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 professional 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.280
 they are 5 euros hyper unit 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.520
 affordable affordable hyper and for their 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.140
 qualities frankly nothing to say so 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.220
 it's pretty colors so already I 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.369
 wish you will see dancing 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.390
 colors still quite enough flexed 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.060
 because I thought, here's the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.610
 spring arrived at the right time at 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 me it's not too eh but a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.810
 little bit in winter I live in 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.060
 france 1 yet but hey I want to be 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.290
 sure a question or the spring did not 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 still validated here are my bones so I 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.250
 was aiming for spring in the summer here I am 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.769
 planned a little bit for for them 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 nice days and to have a little bit of 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.019
 lipsticks it's flashy for for 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.610
 once the sun has decided to 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.569
 show 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.170
 so without further ado I'll go 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.970
 show the colors that I bought 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.470
 so already in general we will say 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.150
 on lipsticks so it's 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.180
 pretty creamy enough creamy textures 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.510
 that he hold that hold very well very 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.160
 nice to wear they said no 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.170
 others of end otherwise you have to 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.269
 crem cosmetics there but really not 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.450
 at an unpleasant pace they are pleasant to 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.000
 also really wear so for 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.880
 start I took the hue 21 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.230
 they do not have a number precisely they 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.100
 have no pardon they do not have a name 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.630
 precisely these are just numbers 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.299
 so the number 21 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.130
 donkey this one there is it huh we're going 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.989
 to say you know how to lose it I'm 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.060
 no one but none from home for you 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.930
 describe and flow to this one it's going to be 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.760
 a plus thouars a raspberry i will say 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.989
 30 neighbors 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.030
 it is one that is frank see 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.040
 I do not believe this one offering boffrand 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.610
 here is fuchsia anyway he'll go out a 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.750
 a bit 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.090
 so you see a super great colors 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.159
 for the summer I find I will make you 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.680
 a little one so be really see I 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:57.250
 just spent a little bit and tac the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:02.319
 direct color on so you see 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.310
 hyper hyper pretty hyper pigmented nothing 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:10.470
 to say so number 21 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:15.269
 then it's number 53 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.250
 So here he is rather a rose 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.350
 garros was finally fuchsia but rather 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.000
 clear in fact everyone was 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.380
 maybe rather raspberry sooner 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.930
 this one a little fuchsia here but 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.350
 still enough to his neon lights pretty flashy 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.680
 1 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.560
 it is below it is always hyper 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.360
 pigmented good it's true that you are very 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.199
 different does not have much to see at the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.389
 camera on the deal in terms of colors 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.490
 it's true that it's pretty subtle enough 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.340
 the first guy like you can not anymore 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:54.360
 here is a little darker and planted 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:59.229
 little clearer then good number 14 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.349
 which is rather a blow to their color 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:07.030
 bandarin not my husband but coral coral 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.080
 pink null null null way in these 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.070
 choirs earlier 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.130
 I do not have if you go to see but it's 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.840
 rather coral just below 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.960
 rather than the right one you are 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.840
 OK with me 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:25.050
 so that's number 14 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:29.460
 then number 26 him who is 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:32.669
 a lot darker black no longer a 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.080
 dislike is much darker that 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.389
 was in the times in shades 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:43.729
 burgundy bordeaux dark oif no 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:45.870
 dark raspberry the hall that serves no purpose 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.280
 no I was going product a loan but 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.259
 after the colors you will determine a 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.860
 little more by yourself you see what 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:55.979
 it looks like it's colors 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:00.060
 flashy already tonight we agree 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:03.630
 was number 26 and then to finish 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.889
 him there we will see the difference a luz 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:13.229
 and a sweet pink girly baby girl or what 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:18.479
 that you want to barbie trausse has not 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:20.130
 of man who is down here so see 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.289
 still the palace of colors I the 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.460
 find sublime sublime for the summer it's going 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:28.889
 to be it's going to be too good a shot and more 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.979
 these are two kinds of red to 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:35.550
 lips that must be worn with what must 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:38.960
 wear with 1 1 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.969
 a make up of relatively measures 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.070
 simple enough bright and then you 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.590
 put one of those lipsticks and 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.240
 that's it you do again savoure makes a 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.240
 make-up here is very classy 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.699
 sophisticated very cool for the summer so 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.229
 so here are these little colors me 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.330
 please to delight 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.919
 so I like a lot I like a lot 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.400
 it's where I was going 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.979
 advises 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.599
 enormously there are fifty or so 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.729
 tents so you will inevitably find 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.469
 your happiness 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.120
 now for 5 euros you risk yourself 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.759
 not too frankly because that's it 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.990
 I bought 5 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:15.599
 in addition to my shipping costs it rather me 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.029
 down 30 30 and some big fir 30 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.349
 euros and a few cents 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:24.089
 it's just price of a hospital in Scotland 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:26.009
 so good and then in terms of quality I 

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:27.210
 you say excluding disposals them we will 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.710
 understand and that's for sure we're not going 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.800
 compare lipsticks to 5 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.449
 euros and ce2 and those at 30 40 or 50 euros 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.759
 but I mean sometimes no 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.589
 need to look for exorbitant prices 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:40.620
 and make-up at exorbitant prices 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:42.629
 to have to have quality so 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.270
 not my cosmetics it's good I wanted 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:48.300
 frankly I recommend it to you thoroughly 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.300
 So that's over with this little 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.469
