00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello people greet you I 'll fix now 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.720
 I'm going to share all the information 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.599
 that I have about how much you earn in 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 youtube for uploading videos on youtube there 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.570
 Two ways to generate income with your 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.660
 videos 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.430
 cpc or cost per click or each click that 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
 a person gives in the ads that 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.259
 they appear in your videos when they are reproduced 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.150
 the cost per click varies from a penny 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.700
 Dollar hereinafter usually 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.840
 it's always between 4 and 6 cents 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.809
 dollar two rpm or income per thousand 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.730
 reproductions here is where you win the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.489
 Most revenue per thousand 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.160
 reproductions since it is paid from 25 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.510
 cents to a dollar but 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.100
 here is something curious 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.600
 the rate of payment for every 1000 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.450
 reproductions constantly changes 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.550
 during the day it was my turn to see that 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.680
 I'm being paid up to 11 dollars for 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.690
 every thousand reproductions but it does not last 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.760
 a lot of time and then go down so 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.489
 regular in the mornings is when the rate 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.530
 rpm is higher unfortunately it is 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.390
 when there are fewer reproductions because 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.580
 people are just getting ready to 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.380
 go to do their daily chores so 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 they do not have time to be in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.360
 youtube one of the factors that also 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.929
 affect the revenue of the videos is the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.299
 category well the category travel 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.560
 and events is the best paid out there goes 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.770
 decreasing income 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.869
 in the other categories another factor that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.240
 affects income is the country where 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.310
 your video plays an ad in your 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.070
 video will be better paid if the video is 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.200
 reproduced in countries like the USA or 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.110
 united arab emirates- that in countries 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.270
 that are not as rich as these other 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.220
 factor that affects income and this 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.710
 few have noticed is the duration of 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.289
 the videos I have another channel where 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.630
 I raise Christian preaching and most of 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.030
 the sermons last more than an hour on 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.940
 last month this channel had 16 thousand 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.780
 reproductions with a total of 330 thousand 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.119
 minutes watched and generated $ 44 a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.000
 difference of this channel set the month 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.149
 past had 190 thousand reproductions with 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.660
 a total of 440 thousand minutes watched and 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.390
 generated $ 135 here is what 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.620
 few have noticed 16 thousand reproductions 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.290
 they generated 44 dollars if we divide 44 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.560
 dollars among 16 thousand reproductions we 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 gives the result of 2.75 dollars for each 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.239
 one thousand reproductions 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.879
 difference was that those 16,000 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.859
 reproductions generated 330 thousand minutes 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.689
 seen where the ads 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.120
 they remained in view of the person 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.280
 that I watch the video during that time and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.769
 clear as it is logical between more time 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.379
 visualize a possible client an ad 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.480
 More income pays you to YouTube 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.879
 highlight that all the preaching of my 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.519
 another channel are in the council category 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.500
 and style another factor that affects the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.510
 income are the blockers of 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.030
 advertising that some of them have installed 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.220
 users on their computers and then only 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.079
 the video comes out but without ads so 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.019
 so much income is not generated for the 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.150
 channel where that video comes from another 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.340
 factor that affects income are the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.590
 short reproductions if a 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.840
 reproduction is canceled just before 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.849
 that the ads appear the counter 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.819
 he already takes it as a reproduction but not 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.769
 income will generate another factor that affects 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.720
 to the income are the networks or 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.299
 companies with which you can associate 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.030
 apart from adsense but this has a 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.129
 advantage and a disadvantage the advantage is 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.169
 that if your strength is the video games there 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.160
 other networks that if you monetize your 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.680
 video games 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.020
 which adsense does not allow you to 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.150
 disadvantage of being with another network is 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.100
 that from your income earned they 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.130
 they took percentage and being with 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.320
 adsense all the cake is yours good 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.540
 people as you will see there are many variants 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.260
 that affect your total income 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.530
 channel in summary are cpc or cost per 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.620
 click rpm or revenue per thousand 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.870
 reproductions category of the video the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.210
 country where your video is played 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.940
 the duration of the video the blockers 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.180
 of advertising short reproductions 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.250
 the network or company and sure there 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.430
 more factors that affect income in 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.980
 a youtube channel summarizing in 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.049
 youtube earns 25 cents 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.470
 up to 2 or 3 dollars for every thousand 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.020
 reproductions good people be as 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.790
