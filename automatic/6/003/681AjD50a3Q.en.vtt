00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
just see how it lays perfectly on the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.670 
just see how it lays perfectly on the
last<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.380> back<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:13.450> right<00:02:14.080> distance

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
last and on the back the right distance

from the edge of the pattern to the edge
of<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> last<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:19.560> two<00:02:20.560> millimeters<00:02:21.400> because

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
of the last is two millimeters because

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.680 
of the last is two millimeters because
we<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.380> consider<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.700> stiffeners<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
we have to consider the stiffeners and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.350 
we have to consider the stiffeners and
the<00:02:26.500> lining<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.990> shoes<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.820> must<00:02:31.120> be

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
the lining of the shoes so it must be

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.650 
the lining of the shoes so it must be
not<00:02:31.780> less<00:02:32.110> than<00:02:32.560> two<00:02:32.830> millimeters<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:34.300> let's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
not less than two millimeters now let's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
not less than two millimeters now let's
look<00:02:34.930> how<00:02:35.200> our<00:02:35.470> pattern<00:02:36.130> lay<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.420> last<00:02:37.630> as

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
look how our pattern lay on the last as

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.570 
look how our pattern lay on the last as
we<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.610> symmetrical<00:02:40.570> pattern<00:02:41.050> now<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.010> have

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
we have symmetrical pattern now we have

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.150 
we have symmetrical pattern now we have
to<00:02:42.730> correct<00:02:42.910> our<00:02:43.420> top<00:02:43.840> line<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.980> inner

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
to correct our top line on the inner

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.120 
to correct our top line on the inner

you<00:03:07.570> see<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> check<00:03:08.620> how<00:03:09.070> much<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.690> rise

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
you see I check how much I have to rise

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.940 
you see I check how much I have to rise
up<00:03:11.140> my<00:03:11.440> line<00:03:11.710> and<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:14.730> will<00:03:15.730> raise<00:03:16.630> up<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:17.290> four

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
up my line and I will raise up on four

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.390 
up my line and I will raise up on four
millimeters<00:03:18.550> from<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.330> lowest<00:03:19.680> place<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:21.040> the

inner side of my pattern and I'm trying

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.400 
inner side of my pattern and I'm trying
to<00:03:26.200> repeat<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.670> original<00:03:28.660> line<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:32.140> line

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
to repeat the original line this line

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.580 
to repeat the original line this line
must<00:03:33.010> be<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:34.090> same<00:03:34.420> line<00:03:34.780> as<00:03:36.630> my<00:03:37.630> line<00:03:38.080> on<00:03:38.380> the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.640 

this<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.400> good<00:04:21.790> benefit<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.540> this<00:04:22.840> method<00:04:23.500> of

this is good benefit of this method of

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.630 
this is good benefit of this method of
construction<00:04:24.160> where<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:24.970> paper<00:04:25.600> pattern

placing on the last I can see all
changes<00:04:31.630> which<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.170> have<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:33.160> create<00:04:33.970> on<00:04:34.300> my

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510

changes which I have to create on my
pattern<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.170> now<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:37.020> check<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:39.060> lasting

that I did all Corrections

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.440 
that I did all Corrections
I<00:05:09.850> check<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.810> top<00:05:11.080> line<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.530> checked<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.760> last

I check the top line I checked the last

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.290 
I check the top line I checked the last
ink<00:05:13.690> allowance<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.890> saw<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:15.580> my<00:05:15.640> pattern
