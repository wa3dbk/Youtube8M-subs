00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
and the 60 millimeter I wanted to give

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.470 
and the 60 millimeter I wanted to give
you<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.540> live<00:00:12.870> feed<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.620> give<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.790> good<00:00:15.269> look

at<00:00:15.719> how<00:00:16.289> much<00:00:16.470> more<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.340> bring<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
at how much more it's going to bring the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.480 
at how much more it's going to bring the
images<00:00:18.390> closer<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.350> further<00:00:19.650> away<00:00:19.859> so

beautiful day I am using no lens on the
iPhone<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> moment<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.780> what<00:00:33.780> we're

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
iPhone at the moment and what we're

going to do is I am going to attach the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.380 
going to do is I am going to attach the
60<00:00:38.280> millimeter<00:00:38.730> lens<00:00:40.579> there<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.860> boom

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
60 millimeter lens there we go and boom

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
60 millimeter lens there we go and boom
brings<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> skyline<00:00:45.989> much<00:00:46.200> closer<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.680> view

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
brings the skyline much closer in view

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.260 
brings the skyline much closer in view
and<00:00:48.320> 60<00:00:49.320> millimetres<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.489> roughly<00:00:51.090> equivalent

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and 60 millimetres is roughly equivalent

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.100 
and 60 millimetres is roughly equivalent
to<00:00:51.949> what<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> naked<00:00:53.969> eye<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to what we see with the naked eye the

has a crop sensor on it as well - you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760 
has a crop sensor on it as well - you
know<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.570> stability<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> everything<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
know for stability and everything the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.590 
know for stability and everything the
actual<00:01:44.189> photos<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:44.880> gonna<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.420> bit

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
actual photos are gonna be a little bit

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
actual photos are gonna be a little bit
different<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.020> here's<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> 18<00:01:46.770> millimeter

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
different but here's the 18 millimeter

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.170 
different but here's the 18 millimeter
lens<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.909> quite<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> bit

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
lens and as you can see it's quite a bit

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.709 
lens and as you can see it's quite a bit
away<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.860> we're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.790> switch<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.119> to

regular view there you have it now of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
regular view there you have it now of
course<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.340> showed<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.810> video

course I showed you the the video

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.630 
course I showed you the the video
examples<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> moment<00:02:05.579> lens

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
examples of the moment lens

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.940 
examples of the moment lens
here<00:02:07.090> are<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.299> lenses<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.659> fronting<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.349> said<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
here are the lenses of fronting I said a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.820 
here are the lenses of fronting I said a
close<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.580> personal<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.690> photography<00:02:11.470> taken

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
close and personal the photography taken

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.190 
close and personal the photography taken
is<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.950> little<00:02:12.190> bit<00:02:12.310> different<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.569> when<00:02:14.110> you

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
is a little bit different the when you

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.500 
is a little bit different the when you
do<00:02:14.379> video<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> iPhone<00:02:15.340> there<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.209> crop

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
do video on the iPhone there is a crop

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.699 
do video on the iPhone there is a crop
factor<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.260> allows<00:02:17.890> for<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.260> shake<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
factor that allows for the the shake of

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.520 
factor that allows for the the shake of
the<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:21.250> know<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.489> shake<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:21.940> iPhone

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the you know the shake of the iPhone

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
it

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.160 
it
that<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.760> essentially<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> moment<00:03:18.720> lens<00:03:18.840> for

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
