00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.010
 August 21st here is my selection for this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 competition I ranked at the top of my 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.639
 prognosis number three resorts the horse 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
 is at best he just won on 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.300
 the pornichet bonuses he already had 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 the opportunity to make an arrival on 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.210
 course to the right will also be 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.439
 free of four feet for the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.600
 first time of his career 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.849
 many assets that designates him as a 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.170
 serious candidate for success is him 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.019
 oppose the number 7 has all of my arm 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.219
 on horseback of a commendable regularity 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.120
 if he has not been able to impose himself 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.770
 this year 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 he collects the good results 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.700
 for several weeks he too 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.500
 right glue profile suits him 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.460
 so he deserves a mention I 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.610
 will also remember the number ten 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.649
 unions whose last two successes 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 one last course were crowned with 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.879
 success one of them having besides 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.390
 been obtained on the course that we 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.160
 interested 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 despite his distance performance 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 they also deserve to be 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.989
 good rank in your games on the 3rd the 7th and the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 10 for my three favorite in this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.760
 race we will ask them the number 16 alex 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.560
 the winner to whom is undoubtedly the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.020
 best horse in pure class in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010
 this horse race that had won 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.610
 who had come to the fore he was 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.869
 last in enghien signing two successes 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.460
 then the horse had several months 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.110
 of absence almost eight months 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.700
 he now has two reentry races 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.729
 in the legs you have to start my 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.740
 notice follow him right now he can 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.320
 from now on appear at the arrival of a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 quinted like this there the number 6 its 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
 volcanoes of the big wet it's a horse that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.229
 for his last body exit on the right 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.159
 imposed itself on the programs of 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.210
 fountain cards also know that I 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.600
 do it already 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.400
 win on this track and from then on I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 think here able to come scramble the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 cards and why not worry them 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.080
 previous cities sure because also 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 number 5 valve on from where they 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.560
 come to rank fifth in a 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.869
 proof of the same invoice moreover on 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.280
 the route that interests us certainly it does not 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.509
 does not seem to have much margin to this 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.430
 level but deferrée of the four feet 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.440
 a place seems in his strings 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 we will also note the number 14 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.190
 star of mystery Caillons trucks 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
 that it is important not to judge on his 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.330
 failure recorded lately on this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.619
 course before the horse had 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.440
 collected several places 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.130
 snap up here is expected and finally 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.470
 absolute number 4 truth that signed two 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.970
 victories on grassy tracks and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.250
 but that is also references to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.370
 argue on the sand from then on in 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.800
 this absolute truth lot will interest the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.800
 valuable underdog lovers summary 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.709
 for this quinté Friday, August 21 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.780
 3 7 10 16 6 5 14 and 4 following the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.250
 program in this Friday 21 years meeting 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.560
 a clearfontaine I really like the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.410
 are they manza who won with the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.030
 way last month to the test and this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.900
 two years should be able to confirm on 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 the Normandy coast 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.360
 in meeting iii now at the test 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.030
 know that olivier trigodet that drives 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.890
 the horses of the succession of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.730
 jean-françois to bernard it's already 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.510
 the man 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.489
 of the coach of the regretted 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.230
 southwestern coach and well stable 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.940
 presents the program of sylvie danuri 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.530
 she collects the good results of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.760
 google start of the year she faces 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.590
 once again an interesting commitment 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.330
 she stayed at the best and runs along my 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.530
 entourage we would be disappointed if it does not 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.840
 was not fighting for the first places 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.819
 of which eight are two sylvie nalluri for 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.260
 a confirmation a candidate for success 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.569
 in my opinion the 801 in this test 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.319
 seems to be the most indicated for him 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.989
 challenge the palm it's bint jakarta 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.730
 third of group 1 it was common 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.099
 october on the hippodrome de saint cloud 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.010
 where this internal 800 in the wake of 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.530
 sylvie maury 820 who should be charged with 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.569
 progress on his half-way run 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.150
 hue on the racecourse of test 802 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.160
 and 801 meeting iii the tests 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.480
 We now go to meeting 4 on 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.060
 Cagnes-sur-mer and bridges time 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.859
 strong the grand prize of the department of 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.140
 alpine copper jacket or 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.120
 two who will also be the third 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.000
 stage of the challenge too high speed 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.769
 called tgv only found at 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.849
 starting the 507 king of lupine one does not 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.069
 present more at this level of competition 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.019
 that on the forefront he finished 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.609
 second of this race last year I 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.989
 do not think able to do this better 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.430
 year 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.200
 although it's true that number seven in 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.630
 outside behind the car on this mail 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.760
 is not a gift we will ask him the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.010
 501 holbrooke who will therefore go to his 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.539
 inside the horse like him was 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.860
 disqualified on the group of mons 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.020
 lately in the hilly price 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.870
 and find here a great opportunity to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.310
 restore its 507 and 501 crest 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.560
 ambush we will be wary of the best 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.720
 protected from fabrice souloy the 503 to 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.360
 vincennes with speed courses 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.889
 we also the 508 not if it is the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.050
 fourth of this race last year 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.100
 but who will also have to deal with 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.550
 a number one 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.460
 8 unenviable behind the car 507 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.140
 520 for places on the 3rd and the 8th 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.630
 now ends with meeting 5 at 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.010
 cabourg I like 407 baccarat 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.140
 jl I think this horse does not have the 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.500
 gains in relation to its potential it s 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.620
 is imposed pleasantly and with ease 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.960
 on the cabourg racecourse this same 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.460
 Norman racecourse and on this fine route 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.710
 July my opinion only an incarnation 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.440
 can prevent it from repeating in this lot to 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.360
 its scope 407 bakar hadji the case of 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.290
 wisdom here for the info of this 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.390
 Friday August 21st 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.510
 excellent game at all good day ago 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.510
 two years
