 these other engines inside these cables 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.630
 in these here are accumulators of 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.550
 energy burckhardt but now they are off 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.830
 in the sense they do not accept electricity 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.630

 mk standing on the spawn plate is fine 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.130
 I know I'm on the plate that strange that 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.560
 what is that a trans poser who 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.180
 probably takes things and the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.190
 throws in lander chest connected to 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.630
 sorting but I'm here on the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.630

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.810
 going up 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.140
 and there is another zombie other others a 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.270
 lots of other zombies continue to 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.030
 get zombie oh my god or my god 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.860

 here they are all connected data related 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.910
 with an organ you look at how many you don't 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.440
 kill instead we want to go away before mine 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.750
 they really never kill impossible 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.680
 kill me and here they are 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.620
 arrived I take the dwarf off and there 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.210
 come out completely and will continue to 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.610
 fall for as long as we are 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.620
 stayed on this plate and we'll do 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.500
 free experience with which to enchant a 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.490
 lot of weapons 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:50.010
 cool but trustworthy but not enough 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.390
 there is something new there too though 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.060
 to tell the truth, these are all for you 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.040
 new things 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.280
 let's look here 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.380
 that's a tir 5 to leave the under 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.870
 but they remain suffocated inside the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.420
 quicksand die draw words under 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.740
 pearls leander bar end up in here and 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.200
 soon we will make a generator 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.700
 automatic iron because one 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.230
 interpellates are four pieces of iron 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.330
 accounts here is active from 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.000
 five minutes very well 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.360
 very well here are the tunnels of the 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.540
 white mountain of mine of my bullfight 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.300
 periodically exposed all of course 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:31.980
 manual here is a lake of leeks and what it is 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:35.310
 that this is my last one 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.020
 once the modify link was created I created 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.970
 this structure though usually me 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.020
 I don't think scenic things it contains 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.580
 debts are there where to go to explore 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.800
 worlds of mixed kraft 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.780
 indeed miss kraft here a beautiful tree you are 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.560
 finally managed to plant the link 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.510
 modify the writing desk and all 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.150
 Intralinks teleport a means that 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.160
 I don't have to go in never and then go 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.500
 here but it works in the same world 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.240
 indeed with this book wherever I am 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.100
 return to this precise point is if 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.190
 I want to go to the tower, I go to mine 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.350
 tower and it's instant ladies and gentlemen 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.350
 I advise you to follow this series 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.650
 in multiplayer because I forgot one 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.820
 what but why am I sorry that there is not 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:27.180
 I can not succeed as never have 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.370
 I turn it back off ok like but I'm on 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.560
 flying so light and I can 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.740
 stay here as if you had the 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.850
 creative because this gentleman is 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.740
 the gravity cas plate 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.760

 I advise you to follow my ASP 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.490
 to see how all these are done 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.080
 interesting little things I discovered is 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.210
 that some people gave me straight 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.210

 thank you so that you can 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.580
 understand the 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.800
 logic behind things to bring that 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.870
 they have indeed brought me and mine 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.830
 friends to build all this well from 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.110
