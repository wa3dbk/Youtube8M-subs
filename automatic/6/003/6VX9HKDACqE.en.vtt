up and ruining your computer because it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.970 
up and ruining your computer because it
is<00:00:40.640> pretty<00:00:41.640> reliable<00:00:42.360> I'd<00:00:42.510> say<00:00:42.870> how<00:00:43.680> much<00:00:43.800> how

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
is pretty reliable I'd say how much how

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
is pretty reliable I'd say how much how
far<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.910> mean<00:00:45.780> I'm<00:00:45.870> pulling

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
far can I take this I mean I'm pulling

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
far can I take this I mean I'm pulling
this<00:00:46.200> thing<00:00:46.260> pretty<00:00:47.250> hard<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.910> not

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this thing pretty hard and it's not

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.810 
this thing pretty hard and it's not
coming<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.140> strong<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
coming off because it's really strong so

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.569 
coming off because it's really strong so
basically<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
basically what you see here is a

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.130 
basically what you see here is a
radiator<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> 1<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.420> 1<00:00:54.449> 20<00:00:54.690> millimeter

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
radiator it is a 1 by 1 20 millimeter

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
radiator it is a 1 by 1 20 millimeter
radiator<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.370> does<00:00:56.520> come<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:58.079> fan

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
radiator and it does come with a fan

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
radiator and it does come with a fan
right<00:00:58.859> here's<00:00:59.129> 120<00:00:59.640> millimeter<00:01:00.000> fan<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
right here's 120 millimeter fan it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630 
right here's 120 millimeter fan it's
actually<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.109> pulse<00:01:01.770> width<00:01:01.890> modulation<00:01:02.280> fan<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
actually a pulse width modulation fan it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630 
actually a pulse width modulation fan it
actually<00:01:02.879> goes<00:01:03.030> from<00:01:03.149> 1702<00:01:03.899> 2250<00:01:04.739> RPM<00:01:05.129> gives

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
actually goes from 1702 2250 RPM gives

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.780 
actually goes from 1702 2250 RPM gives
you<00:01:05.760> 18<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> 32<00:01:06.510> decibels<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> airflow<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.430> not

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you 18 to 32 decibels and airflow is not

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
you 18 to 32 decibels and airflow is not
really<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.090> important<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.380> don't<00:01:10.530> have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really as important and I don't have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.020 
really as important and I don't have
that<00:01:10.770> specification<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.760> sure<00:01:11.909> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that specification but I'm sure it's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.010 
that specification but I'm sure it's
pretty<00:01:12.180> fine<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.720> important

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pretty fine but it's not as important

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.090 
pretty fine but it's not as important
because<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.409> pushing<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
because you're not pushing here into the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.200 
because you're not pushing here into the
case<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:14.760> about<00:01:14.850> pushing<00:01:15.000> here

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
case it's more part about pushing here

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.679 
case it's more part about pushing here
through<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.049> radiator<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:18.299> block

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
through the radiator this is your block

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.890 
through the radiator this is your block
it<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.590> copper<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.670> has<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.240> pre-application

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it is copper it has a pre-application

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.590 
it is copper it has a pre-application
there<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> pre<00:01:22.830> applied<00:01:23.159> thermal<00:01:23.970> paste<00:01:24.330> it's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
there a pre applied thermal paste it's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.820 
there a pre applied thermal paste it's
actually<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.140> compound<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.710> not

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
actually like a little compound it's not

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
actually like a little compound it's not
really<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> grease<00:01:26.430> per<00:01:26.700> se<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
really a grease per se it's kind of

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.200 
really a grease per se it's kind of
sticky<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.020> stuck<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
sticky and stuck on there now there is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
sticky and stuck on there now there is
three<00:01:30.540> point<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:30.960> millimeters<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> static

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
three point two millimeters of static

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
three point two millimeters of static
pressure<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> system<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> means

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
pressure in this system so that means

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.069 
pressure in this system so that means
there's<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:35.600> pressure<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
there's actually pressure in here the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.950 
there's actually pressure in here the
water<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.790> building<00:01:38.790> pressure<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.810> that's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
water is building pressure and that's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.060 
water is building pressure and that's
good<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.530> increase<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
good it's going to increase the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
good it's going to increase the
efficiency<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.909> system<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> system<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
efficiency of the system on a system the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
efficiency of the system on a system the
custom<00:01:44.009> build<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> can't<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.850> have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
custom build you can't really have

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.249 
custom build you can't really have
pressure<00:01:45.329> because<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.630> can't<00:01:45.930> seal<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
pressure because you can't seal the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
pressure because you can't seal the
system<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.299> positive

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
system so they don't have positive

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.929 
system so they don't have positive
pressure<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.710> does<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.610> really

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
pressure this one does and that's really

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.600 
pressure this one does and that's really
really<00:01:51.090> cool<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.649> that's<00:01:52.649> basically<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.130> will

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
really cool so that's basically it will

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.999 
really cool so that's basically it will
fit<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.210> any<00:01:54.710> CPU<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> can

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
fit just about any CPU that you can

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.679 
fit just about any CPU that you can
throw<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.850> multi<00:01:57.240> bracket

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
throw at it so it's multi bracket

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.819 
throw at it so it's multi bracket
