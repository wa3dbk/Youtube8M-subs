the top of my hand but use whichever

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
the top of my hand but use whichever

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
MIT now if you're new to knitting let's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.830 
MIT now if you're new to knitting let's
get<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.739> appear<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.340> not<00:02:17.430> too<00:02:17.610> tight

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
get this appear so it's not too tight

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.539 
get this appear so it's not too tight
you<00:02:18.840> never<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.409> work<00:02:19.560> right<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.129> tips

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
you never want to work right on the tips

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.539 
you never want to work right on the tips
because<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.150> tips<00:02:21.390> taper<00:02:21.690> downwards<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:23.040> if

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
because the tips taper downwards and if

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.860 
because the tips taper downwards and if
you<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.879> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> knitting<00:02:24.450> needle<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.840> a

you think of the knitting needle as a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.649 
you think of the knitting needle as a
rod<00:02:25.230> that's<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.250> gauge<00:02:26.519> for<00:02:27.120> how<00:02:27.239> big<00:02:27.480> your

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
rod that's your gauge for how big your

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.750 
rod that's your gauge for how big your
loops<00:02:27.900> are<00:02:28.280> obviously<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.430> work<00:02:29.580> down

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
loops are obviously if you work down

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
struggling to get every tension just

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.720 
struggling to get every tension just
right<00:03:13.470> because<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.040> will<00:03:14.310> stress<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.700> out

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
they have more friction okay I've got

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.409 
they have more friction okay I've got
one<00:03:46.709> stitch<00:03:46.980> left<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.790> I'm<00:03:47.849> just<00:03:48.209> going<00:03:48.389> to

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
one stitch left so I'm just going to

one stitch left so I'm just going to
knit<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:49.019> normal<00:03:49.380> way<00:03:49.790> get<00:03:50.790> rid<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.000> this

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
knit it the normal way get rid of this

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.539 
knit it the normal way get rid of this
needle<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.750> now<00:03:52.709> we're<00:03:52.919> gonna<00:03:53.010> churn<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
needle and now we're gonna churn the

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.659 
needle and now we're gonna churn the
whole<00:03:53.790> deal<00:03:54.120> around<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:56.069> this<00:03:56.190> side<00:03:56.430> looks

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
whole deal around and this side looks

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.330 
whole deal around and this side looks
like<00:03:56.879> purl<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.480> bumpy<00:03:57.780> side<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.349> did<00:03:59.160> have<00:03:59.280> a

like purl the bumpy side I did have a
tutorial<00:03:59.609> on<00:03:59.849> how<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.030> purl<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.599> don't

purling<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.859> little<00:04:17.099> more<00:04:17.599> complicated

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
purling a little more complicated

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.409 
purling a little more complicated
because<00:04:19.549> we're<00:04:20.549> not<00:04:20.669> used<00:04:20.849> to<00:04:20.940> pushing<00:04:21.329> away

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
because we're not used to pushing away

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.570 
because we're not used to pushing away
we're<00:04:22.229> not<00:04:22.260> used<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.710> pushing<00:04:23.010> things<00:04:23.340> away

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
we're not used to pushing things away

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.920 
we're not used to pushing things away
from<00:04:23.640> us<00:04:23.940> we're<00:04:24.210> more<00:04:24.390> used<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.690> pulling

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
from us we're more used to pulling

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.320
