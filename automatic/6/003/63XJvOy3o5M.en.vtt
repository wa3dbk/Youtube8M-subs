00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 the chacarita 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.490
 the chacarera is a very festive rhythm and 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.160
 that has its origins also in the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.830
 North of the Argentine Republic 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 especially in one of its provinces 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.869
 called santiago del estero 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 it's stylistic to play this rhythm with 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.700
 guitars sometimes with violin also 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.360
 making the melodic line and the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.320
 introductions and especially the same 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.760
 instrument that we use in the samba to 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.580
 reinforce the rhythm that is the hype of 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.769
 good the chords that we are going to use 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.790
 in this chacarera called chacarera 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:46.129
 of the ranch so is its name the chords 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.129
 the following are the minor 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.829
 my 7th 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.930
 greater 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.330
 and seventh sun 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.050
 the tonal center is the lowest 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.300
 the chacarera sounds of the following 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.300
 way 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.110
 let's see carefully how is the use 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.840
 from the right hand a quick down 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.890
 a click 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.090
 one hit up 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.090
 another click 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.310
 one hit down and one up 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:55.510
 the cycle closes when the thumb 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:58.000
 is the ray up goes if so so so 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.480
 we do a small practice using 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.140
 the chords that are going to be used in this 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.140
 chacarera del rancho 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.380
