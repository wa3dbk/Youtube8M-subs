00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
cookies trying to make these molds they

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
cookies trying to make these molds they
are<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.079> fragile<00:00:52.739> when<00:00:53.160> you're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
are really really fragile when you're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860

pushing<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.910> into<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> mold<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.719> just

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
pushing them into the mold so you just

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
pushing them into the mold so you just
want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.350> careful<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> cookies

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
want to be really careful the cookies

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
want to be really careful the cookies
are<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.680> small<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> don't

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
are really really small so you don't

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.050 
are really really small so you don't
need<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> soap<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.660> make<00:01:00.840> each<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:08.060> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
need a lot of soap to make each one so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
need a lot of soap to make each one so
once<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:10.020> amount<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.350> soap<00:01:10.650> cut

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
once you have a good amount of soap cut

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.830 
once you have a good amount of soap cut
into<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> little<00:01:11.700> Bowl<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
into a little Bowl you just want to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.289 
into a little Bowl you just want to
microwave<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.409> about<00:01:13.590> 20<00:01:14.490> seconds<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
microwave it for about 20 seconds and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
microwave it for about 20 seconds and
you<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> watch<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> entire<00:01:16.530> time

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you want to watch it the entire time

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340 
you want to watch it the entire time
because<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.640> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.330> bubble<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because it will kind of bubble over and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
because it will kind of bubble over and
spill<00:01:19.799> everywhere<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> big<00:01:20.759> mess<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
spill everywhere and make a big mess and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
spill everywhere and make a big mess and
also<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.140> careful<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.920> really

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
also be careful because it's really

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
also be careful because it's really
really<00:01:23.729> hot<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> comes<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
really hot when it comes out of the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
really hot when it comes out of the
microwave<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.340> before<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> sets<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> want

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
microwave and so before it sets you want

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
microwave and so before it sets you want
to<00:01:27.720> add<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.320> dye<00:01:28.560> oh<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> start

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.210 
really quick so now to make the filling
I<00:02:06.219> tried<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.969> using<00:02:07.659> some<00:02:08.319> white<00:02:08.500> soap<00:02:08.890> and

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
I tried just using some white soap and

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.339 
I tried just using some white soap and
letting<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.759> kind<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.060> set<00:02:10.269> up<00:02:10.420> but<00:02:11.170> that

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
letting it kind of set up but that

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.710 
letting it kind of set up but that
didn't<00:02:11.709> work<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.730> took<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:13.150> little<00:02:13.299> piece

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
didn't work and so I took a little piece

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.990 
didn't work and so I took a little piece
of<00:02:13.870> clay<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.380> made<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.590> disc<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.220> then<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.849> made

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
of clay and made a disc and then I made

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.610 
of clay and made a disc and then I made
a<00:02:16.030> mold<00:02:16.329> of<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.989> now<00:02:17.079> I'm<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.349> pouring

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
a mold of that and now I'm just pouring

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.069 
a mold of that and now I'm just pouring
white<00:02:17.950> soap<00:02:18.280> into<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.880> mold<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:19.959> is

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
white soap into that mold and this is

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.559 
white soap into that mold and this is
going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.709> cream<00:02:20.980> filling<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.510> to
