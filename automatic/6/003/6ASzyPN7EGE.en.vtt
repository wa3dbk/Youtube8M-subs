took<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> stuff<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
took the up the way the stuff in the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.819 
took the up the way the stuff in the
background<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.989> cuz<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> lion<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
background is cuz the way the lion I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.860 
background is cuz the way the lion I
have<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.579> background<00:01:00.120> usually<00:01:00.510> has<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
