today<00:00:03.139> we're<00:00:03.290> going<00:00:03.379> to<00:00:03.499> talk<00:00:03.649> about<00:00:03.770> audio

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
today we're going to talk about audio

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.650 
today we're going to talk about audio
noise<00:00:04.580> and<00:00:05.029> we're<00:00:05.270> going<00:00:05.390> to<00:00:05.450> talk<00:00:05.629> about

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
noise and we're going to talk about

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.309 
noise and we're going to talk about
safety

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
safety

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.370 
safety
now<00:00:06.799> audio<00:00:07.220> noises<00:00:07.819> it<00:00:07.970> pertains<00:00:08.450> to<00:00:08.720> the

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
now audio noises it pertains to the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.560 
now audio noises it pertains to the
equipment<00:00:09.890> that<00:00:09.920> you<00:00:10.400> and<00:00:10.580> I<00:00:10.670> might<00:00:10.940> use<00:00:10.970> as<00:00:11.540> a

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
equipment that you and I might use as a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.720 
equipment that you and I might use as a
musician<00:00:12.200> or<00:00:12.350> amplifiers<00:00:12.950> our<00:00:13.340> guitars

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
musician or amplifiers our guitars

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.299 
musician or amplifiers our guitars
whether<00:00:14.060> acoustic<00:00:14.750> or<00:00:14.900> electric<00:00:14.990> and<00:00:15.890> I'm

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
whether acoustic or electric and I'm

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.130 
whether acoustic or electric and I'm
going<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:16.550> demonstrate<00:00:16.869> something<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.990> you

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
going to demonstrate something to you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.900 
going to demonstrate something to you
today<00:00:18.380> that's<00:00:19.130> hopefully<00:00:19.519> going<00:00:19.699> to<00:00:19.759> make<00:00:19.880> a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
today that's hopefully going to make a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.060 
today that's hopefully going to make a
principle<00:00:20.630> that<00:00:21.050> we<00:00:21.109> took<00:00:21.439> here<00:00:21.679> at<00:00:21.769> Taylor

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
principle that we took here at Taylor

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.130 
principle that we took here at Taylor
talked<00:00:22.279> about<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.580> lot<00:00:22.820> very<00:00:23.210> real<00:00:23.689> to<00:00:23.990> you

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
talked about a lot very real to you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.409 
talked about a lot very real to you
because<00:00:24.740> we<00:00:24.949> we<00:00:25.339> found<00:00:25.609> that<00:00:25.759> experience

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
because we we found that experience

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.800 
because we we found that experience
dictates<00:00:27.199> believability<00:00:28.009> and<00:00:28.539> yet<00:00:29.539> most

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
dictates believability and yet most

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.779 
dictates believability and yet most
people<00:00:29.900> don't<00:00:30.380> want<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.800> type<00:00:30.980> of<00:00:31.009> experience

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
people don't want the type of experience

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.730 
people don't want the type of experience
or<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.119> negative<00:00:32.630> type<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:33.050> experience<00:00:33.560> that

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
or the negative type of experience that

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.550 
or the negative type of experience that
can<00:00:33.920> be<00:00:33.950> caused<00:00:34.340> through<00:00:34.910> this<00:00:35.030> situation<00:00:35.560> now

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
can be caused through this situation now

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
can be caused through this situation now
what<00:00:36.740> I'm<00:00:36.830> going<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.010> use<00:00:37.070> today<00:00:37.400> to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
what I'm going to use today to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.700 
what I'm going to use today to
demonstrate<00:00:37.880> this<00:00:38.450> it's<00:00:39.170> called<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.470> low

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
demonstrate this it's called a low

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.430 
demonstrate this it's called a low
voltage<00:00:40.040> detector<00:00:40.850> now<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:41.870> can<00:00:42.140> buy<00:00:42.380> these

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
voltage detector now you can buy these

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.710 
voltage detector now you can buy these
at<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:43.250> lot<00:00:43.430> electrical<00:00:43.940> supplies<00:00:44.300> are<00:00:44.570> not

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
at a lot electrical supplies are not

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.300 
at a lot electrical supplies are not
that<00:00:44.900> expensive<00:00:45.260> they're<00:00:45.650> about<00:00:45.830> eighteen

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
that expensive they're about eighteen

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.110 
that expensive they're about eighteen
dollars<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:48.470> all<00:00:49.310> it's<00:00:49.520> going<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.700> do<00:00:49.880> is

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
dollars and all it's going to do is

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.600 
dollars and all it's going to do is
going<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.720> it<00:00:50.870> this<00:00:51.170> detects<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.010> presence<00:00:52.190> of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
going to it this detects the presence of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.630 
going to it this detects the presence of
an<00:00:52.760> alternating<00:00:53.300> electrical<00:00:54.170> field<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.490> when

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
an alternating electrical field so when

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.680 
an alternating electrical field so when
I<00:00:55.670> turn<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:55.970> on<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:58.790> start<00:00:59.090> moving<00:00:59.330> it

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
I turn it on and I start moving it

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.660 
I turn it on and I start moving it
towards<00:00:59.870> an<00:01:00.380> audio<00:01:00.890> line<00:01:01.220> and<00:01:01.430> we're<00:01:01.520> just

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
towards an audio line and we're just

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.730 
towards an audio line and we're just
using<00:01:01.880> this<00:01:02.180> these<00:01:02.450> amplifiers<00:01:03.080> we<00:01:03.350> have<00:01:03.530> here

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
using this these amplifiers we have here

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.349 
using this these amplifiers we have here
at<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.890> shop<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.369> here's<00:01:04.640> my<00:01:04.789> power<00:01:05.030> cable

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:05.359 
at the shop so here's my power cable

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:07.870 
at the shop so here's my power cable
coming<00:01:05.749> from<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.140> amplifier<00:01:06.649> and<00:01:06.950> as<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.579> move

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
coming from this amplifier and as I move

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.239 
coming from this amplifier and as I move
close<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.170> starts<00:01:10.210> detecting<00:01:12.249> the

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.249 
close to it it starts detecting the

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.399 
close to it it starts detecting the
presence<00:01:13.759> of<00:01:13.880> an<00:01:14.030> alternating<00:01:14.570> electrical

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
presence of an alternating electrical

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.260 
presence of an alternating electrical
field<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:16.069> telling<00:01:16.579> me<00:01:16.700> there's<00:01:16.969> something

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
field is telling me there's something

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.239 
field is telling me there's something
there<00:01:18.280> closer<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.429> get<00:01:19.520> more<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.210> wants<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.479> beat

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
there closer I get more it wants to beat

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.709 
there closer I get more it wants to beat
now<00:01:22.249> there's<00:01:22.460> nothing<00:01:22.850> on<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.149> amplifier

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
now there's nothing on this amplifier

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.300 
now there's nothing on this amplifier
because<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:24.200> grounded<00:01:24.619> there's<00:01:24.829> nothing<00:01:25.159> on

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
because it's grounded there's nothing on

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.669 
because it's grounded there's nothing on
this<00:01:25.460> audio<00:01:25.670> cable<00:01:26.270> plug<00:01:26.990> into<00:01:27.200> one<00:01:27.319> of<00:01:27.499> my<00:01:27.590> own

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
this audio cable plug into one of my own

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.099 
this audio cable plug into one of my own
personal<00:01:28.069> guitars<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.759> own<00:01:29.109> again

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
personal guitars that I own again

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.529 
personal guitars that I own again
nothing<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.799> guitar<00:01:31.389> so<00:01:32.389> we're

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
nothing on the guitar so we're

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.660 
nothing on the guitar so we're
completely<00:01:32.749> fine<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:33.950> what<00:01:34.069> we<00:01:34.249> want<00:01:34.429> to<00:01:34.520> do

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
completely fine now what we want to do

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.029 
completely fine now what we want to do
is<00:01:35.329> show<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.689> what<00:01:35.990> happens<00:01:36.409> when<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.859> remove

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
is show you what happens when we remove

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.999 
is show you what happens when we remove
ground<00:01:37.850> from<00:01:38.090> this<00:01:38.240> situation<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.020> again<00:01:39.560> by

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
ground from this situation and again by

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.709 
ground from this situation and again by
the<00:01:40.069> way<00:01:40.219> this<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.609> reason<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.270> don't

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
the way this is the reason you don't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.489 
the way this is the reason you don't
want<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.740> audio<00:01:43.100> cable<00:01:43.429> laying<00:01:44.389> across<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
want the audio cable laying across the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.020 
want the audio cable laying across the
power<00:01:45.679> cable<00:01:46.189> because<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.700> thing<00:01:46.909> is

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
power cable because this thing is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.889 
power cable because this thing is
emitting<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.689> field<00:01:48.789> okay<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:49.999> what<00:01:50.509> happens

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
emitting a field okay and what happens

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.599 
emitting a field okay and what happens
is<00:01:51.049> you<00:01:51.200> do<00:01:51.319> that<00:01:51.499> sort<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.799> thing<00:01:54.310> it'll<00:01:55.310> start

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
is you do that sort of thing it'll start

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.399 
is you do that sort of thing it'll start
being<00:01:55.819> conducted<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.389> the<00:01:56.479> line<00:01:56.600> Oh<00:01:56.810> real

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
being conducted to the line Oh real

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.440 
being conducted to the line Oh real
quick<00:01:57.560> before<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.950> get<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.249> this<00:01:58.450> human

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
quick before we get to this human

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.330 
quick before we get to this human
conductivity<00:02:00.139> I'm<00:02:00.590> going<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.799> hold<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.130> tip

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
conductivity I'm going to hold the tip

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.590 
conductivity I'm going to hold the tip
of<00:02:01.459> this<00:02:01.549> now<00:02:01.789> watch<00:02:01.999> me<00:02:02.240> I'm<00:02:02.329> going<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.509> move

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
of this now watch me I'm going to move

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.080 
of this now watch me I'm going to move
my<00:02:02.659> hand<00:02:03.130> into<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.490> field

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
my hand into this field

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.859 
my hand into this field
slowly<00:02:06.670> I'm<00:02:07.670> not<00:02:07.850> even<00:02:08.060> touching<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.509> cable

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
slowly I'm not even touching the cable

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.350 
slowly I'm not even touching the cable
yet<00:02:09.340> now<00:02:10.340> I'm<00:02:10.489> touching<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.970> cable

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
yet now I'm touching the cable

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.280 
yet now I'm touching the cable
so<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> human<00:02:12.530> body<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.100> conductive<00:02:13.790> as<00:02:13.940> well

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
so the human body is conductive as well

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.660 
so the human body is conductive as well
most<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.470> they're<00:02:15.680> aware<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.130> this<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.520> it's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
most of they're aware of this but it's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.860 
most of they're aware of this but it's
kind<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> neat<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.660> little

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
kind of a neat to see a little

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.950 
kind of a neat to see a little
demonstration<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.650> now<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:20.780> I'm<00:02:20.870> going

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
demonstration of it now what I'm going

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.490 
demonstration of it now what I'm going
to<00:02:21.020> do<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:22.150> unplug<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.480> again<00:02:23.930> I'm

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
to do is unplug this and again I'm

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500 
to do is unplug this and again I'm
trying<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.010> create<00:02:25.250> an<00:02:25.340> environment<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.970> we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
trying to create an environment that we

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.390 
trying to create an environment that we
see<00:02:26.720> very<00:02:27.080> commonly<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.800> our<00:02:27.920> world<00:02:28.130> where

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
see very commonly in our world where

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.700 
see very commonly in our world where
someone<00:02:28.700> has<00:02:28.940> taken<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.420> ground<00:02:29.960> lug<00:02:30.380> and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
someone has taken the ground lug and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.370 
someone has taken the ground lug and
they've<00:02:31.280> cut<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.790> off<00:02:32.060> or<00:02:32.450> they're<00:02:33.020> plugged

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
they've cut it off or they're plugged

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.470 
they've cut it off or they're plugged
into<00:02:33.680> an<00:02:34.160> extension<00:02:34.580> cord<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.150> doesn't

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
into an extension cord that doesn't

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.720 
into an extension cord that doesn't
allow<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.080> make<00:02:36.230> contact<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.100> we're

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
allow this to make contact and we're

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.940 
allow this to make contact and we're
going<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.880> lift<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:39.110> ground<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.800> this

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
going to lift the ground of this

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.660 
going to lift the ground of this
amplifier<00:02:40.840> okay<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.200> now<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.980> ground<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.520> we

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
amplifier okay so now the ground that we

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.280 
amplifier okay so now the ground that we
had<00:02:43.880> established<00:02:44.030> where<00:02:44.630> there<00:02:44.750> was<00:02:44.840> no<00:02:45.080> noise

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
had established where there was no noise

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.160 
had established where there was no noise
emit<00:02:45.800> being<00:02:46.040> emitted<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.490> now<00:02:46.790> removed<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:48.050> now

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
emit being emitted is now removed so now

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.080 
emit being emitted is now removed so now
I'm<00:02:48.230> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.440> turn<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:49.459> low<00:02:49.670> voltage

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
I'm going to turn on my low voltage

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.900 
I'm going to turn on my low voltage
detector<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.840> now<00:02:51.350> you'll<00:02:51.530> notice<00:02:51.770> it's<00:02:52.610> just

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
detector and now you'll notice it's just

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.850 
detector and now you'll notice it's just

this<00:03:04.670> amplifier<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:05.870> looking<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:06.800> ground

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
this amplifier is now looking for ground

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.090 
this amplifier is now looking for ground
and<00:03:07.910> we've<00:03:08.270> created<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.320> situation<00:03:09.560> where

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
and we've created a situation where

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.480 
and we've created a situation where
noise<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:11.090> floating<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.720> air<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:13.190> even

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
noise is floating in the air but even

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.460 
noise is floating in the air but even
worse<00:03:13.640> than<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.060> we've<00:03:14.270> created<00:03:14.630> an<00:03:14.930> unsafe

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
worse than that we've created an unsafe

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.380 
worse than that we've created an unsafe
situation<00:03:16.100> where<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:16.400> I'm<00:03:16.640> holding<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.209> guitar

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
situation where if I'm holding a guitar

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.509 
situation where if I'm holding a guitar
with<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> string<00:03:18.260> ground<00:03:18.530> which<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.190> very

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
with a string ground which is very

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.520 
with a string ground which is very
common<00:03:19.880> in<00:03:19.970> our<00:03:20.060> world<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.989> move<00:03:21.230> towards

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
common in our world and I move towards

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.520 
common in our world and I move towards
this<00:03:21.800> microphone<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.000> bam<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.810> get<00:03:24.290> what<00:03:24.440> we

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
this microphone and bam I get what we

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.160 
this microphone and bam I get what we
call<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.860> blue<00:03:25.040> spark<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.580> occurs<00:03:26.170> okay

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
call the blue spark that occurs okay

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.470 
call the blue spark that occurs okay
that's<00:03:28.160> where<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.580> situation<00:03:29.180> becomes

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
that's where the situation becomes

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.000 
that's where the situation becomes
dangerous<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.230> something<00:03:30.530> we<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:30.769> need<00:03:30.980> to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
dangerous and something we all need to

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.280 
dangerous and something we all need to
be<00:03:31.130> aware<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:32.090> again<00:03:32.120> real<00:03:32.540> quick<00:03:32.780> two

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
be aware of so again real quick two
