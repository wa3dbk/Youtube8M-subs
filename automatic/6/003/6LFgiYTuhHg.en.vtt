I'm<00:00:42.300> forcing<00:00:42.540> him<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.140> follow<00:00:43.680> them

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I'm forcing him do you know follow them

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
I'm forcing him do you know follow them
with<00:00:44.879> follow<00:00:45.180> me<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.829> did<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:48.320> new

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
with follow me so I did get a little new

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
with follow me so I did get a little new
strategy<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.700> protect<00:00:51.210> which

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
strategy in there with the protect which

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.740 
strategy in there with the protect which
binds<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:52.079> usually<00:00:52.199> another<00:00:52.620> turn<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.750> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
binds me usually another turn or two so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.970 
binds me usually another turn or two so
I<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:55.170> set<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.219> stockpiles<00:00:57.120> enough<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
I can set up my stockpiles enough and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
I can set up my stockpiles enough and
luckily<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> critical<00:01:00.030> hit<00:01:00.570> didn't<00:01:00.870> come

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
luckily the critical hit didn't come

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
luckily the critical hit didn't come
from<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.289> Skarmory<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.090> only

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
from a Skarmory but you know it's only

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.560 
from a Skarmory but you know it's only
like<00:01:03.449> 12%<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.820> regigigas<00:01:05.820> comes<00:01:06.360> out

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
like 12% but then regigigas comes out

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.170 
like 12% but then regigigas comes out
and<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.560> over<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.790> yeah

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and you know it's over you know it yeah

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
let's move on destiny Vaughn you know it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.290 
let's move on destiny Vaughn you know it
gets<00:03:55.960> up<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.530> stuff<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.370> they<00:03:57.610> don't<00:03:57.790> use<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
gets up and stuff so they don't use the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.450 
gets up and stuff so they don't use the
night<00:03:58.450> slash<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.960> knock<00:03:59.140> out<00:03:59.380> delayed<00:03:59.800> but

night slash to knock out delayed but

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.370 
night slash to knock out delayed but
instead<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:00.910> decide<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.390> fly<00:04:01.720> which<00:04:02.020> is<00:04:02.200> also

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
instead they decide to fly which is also

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.340 
instead they decide to fly which is also
equally<00:04:02.950> deadly<00:04:03.570> they<00:04:04.570> send<00:04:04.810> out<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.930> rhyperior

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.040 
equally deadly they send out a rhyperior
and<00:04:05.710> this<00:04:06.190> is<00:04:06.370> why<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.480> delay<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.930> because

and this is why I like delay is because

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.020 
and this is why I like delay is because
