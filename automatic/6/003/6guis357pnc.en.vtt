this tutorial and then you're gonna go

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.360 
this tutorial and then you're gonna go
ahead<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.360> thread<00:00:41.900> your<00:00:42.170> needle<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.770> we<00:00:43.190> are

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
ahead and thread your needle and we are

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.100 
ahead and thread your needle and we are
going<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.850> take<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.239> bigger<00:00:44.450> rectangular

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
going to take the bigger rectangular

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.590 
going to take the bigger rectangular
piece<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.650> do<00:00:46.250> running<00:00:46.610> stitches<00:00:46.940> right<00:00:47.300> in

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
piece and do running stitches right in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:58.630 
piece and do running stitches right in
the<00:00:47.809> middle<00:00:48.020> of<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.920> felt<00:00:49.550> piece<00:00:57.520> forget<00:00:58.520> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
the middle of the felt piece forget to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.160 
the middle of the felt piece forget to
so<00:00:58.820> you're<00:00:59.000> running<00:00:59.150> stitches<00:00:59.420> from<00:00:59.720> bottom

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
so you're running stitches from bottom

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.600 
so you're running stitches from bottom
to<00:01:00.200> top<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.739> once<00:01:00.950> you've<00:01:01.100> done<00:01:01.220> that<00:01:01.280> we're

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
just going to create a scrunched up look

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.749 
just going to create a scrunched up look
