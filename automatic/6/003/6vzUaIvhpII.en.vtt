00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 a nice circuit for the owners using 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.200
 three angles the approach on the chest one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 on the flat bench 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 the car on inclined bench and then of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.549
 pushups 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 then we do both a flat bench 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.880
 basic method which can be one 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.189
 exercise performed on flat kakÃ  

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 making four sets of 10 movements 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:34.320
 therefore between heating always legs 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.960
 other in protecting the bench back 4 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.540
 7 10 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.239
 try to give free time between one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:50.340
 seat at the other around thirty seconds 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 I can do 46 12 on the bench then passed one 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:01.820
 bank at 45 degrees to make the portion 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 always higher than the chest 47 10 crosses 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.110
 take care of your elbow depression 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 compared to the chest sale italy and then 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 always wait a few seconds so 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 so muscle the chest will wear well of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.510
 tension and then where to do also 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.040
 slightly 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:33.350
 extra noticing the wrist anyway 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.990
 weighs was high and more external than the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.750
 chest also 4 7 10 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.710
 then to follow for lower processing 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.770
 or zip files to the parallels or otherwise 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.710
 folds you want to do is supported 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.740
 on the ground both on the bench ok 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.810
 in this case do not use the load 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.550
 a little bit longer series begins to 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.600
 do 47 to 15 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.600
 you want to bounce your health care office 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.130
 then then I will have done the scheme 4 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.190
 because another system does not even think about it 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.860
 always do as in the 10th maybe with the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.570
 extremely slow institutions that are 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 very tiring a little more boring e 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:30.440
 let's keep going you will make a lot of variation 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:34.380
 effective for slow pectorals 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.670
 taking care of the maximum extension and the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.670
 maximum flexion of the arm 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:53.549
 they are another variable exercise 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:56.760
 clearly short heating then 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.220
 to the four series of 10 with loads 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.750
 quite high even with the execution 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 normal times with enough loads 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.510
 high with extremely slow performance 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.900
 with slightly lower loads e 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.579
 exclusive 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.159
 maybe he does n't even know about the nail in the 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.840
 crib we are doing at all for 10 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.690
 but I am of the mind that the muscles 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.010
 they must be stimulated in various ways unless 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.200
 that a technical gesture should not be made 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.400
 of the athletes you need to do 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.519
 a certain technician that is another 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.730
 talk in the be of always who wants 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.450
 shopping for those who want to make mass 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.180
 harmonic muscle moreover with the aim 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.319
 only one external factor is a 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.669
 factor to feel good 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.449
 then another criterion on these two su 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:51.720
 flat bench and high and so-called bank 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:55.730
 pyramidal I always do it 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.299
 scheme of 12 finishes 10 repetitions 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.510
 8 repetitions 10 directions of 12 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.900
 directions for the five mills 5 series 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.970
 with the central seat or maximum load 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.930
 if you need assistance 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.299
 someone 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.680
 helps because on top dogs between 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.160
 also the one always with the same 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.509
 level or is only in slow motion o 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.810
 really relatively fast 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:29.039
 therefore a nice method to do 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.470
 work the upper low outer portions 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.770
 and central chest good training 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.770
