when<00:05:17.649> I<00:05:17.709> talk<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:17.949> somebody<00:05:18.249> look<00:05:18.849> at<00:05:18.969> them

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:19.119 
when I talk to somebody look at them

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.489 
when I talk to somebody look at them
they've<00:05:19.599> been<00:05:19.629> other<00:05:19.839> times<00:05:19.929> I<00:05:20.229> came<00:05:20.319> on<00:05:20.439> a

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:20.499 
they've been other times I came on a

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.439 
they've been other times I came on a
pause<00:05:20.709> they<00:05:20.889> can't<00:05:21.099> turn<00:05:21.279> away<00:05:21.369> cuz<00:05:22.119> it's<00:05:22.300> like

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449
