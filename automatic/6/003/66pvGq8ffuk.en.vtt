00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
and this listen I'll be talking about

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.940 
and this listen I'll be talking about
rhythmic<00:00:02.070> copying<00:00:02.490> for<00:00:02.850> jazz<00:00:03.240> guitar<00:00:04.430> and<00:00:05.839> I

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
rhythmic copying for jazz guitar and I

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.620 
rhythmic copying for jazz guitar and I
all<00:00:07.950> first<00:00:08.400> I'll<00:00:08.550> talk<00:00:08.670> about<00:00:08.730> kind<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.510> a

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
all first I'll talk about kind of a

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.280 
all first I'll talk about kind of a
basic<00:00:10.139> way<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.349> approach<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.670> method<00:00:12.290> then

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
basic way to approach this method then

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.340 
basic way to approach this method then
I'll<00:00:13.380> talk<00:00:13.590> about<00:00:13.849> a<00:00:14.849> slightly<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:15.990> advanced

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I'll talk about a slightly more advanced

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.490 
I'll talk about a slightly more advanced
way<00:00:17.779> so<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.020> basic<00:00:19.350> way<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
way so the basic way is so for this

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800 
way so the basic way is so for this
example<00:00:22.710> let's<00:00:22.949> take<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.550> 12<00:00:24.060> bar<00:00:24.240> blues<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
example let's take a 12 bar blues and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.250 
example let's take a 12 bar blues and
b-flat<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:26.779> basically<00:00:27.779> we'll<00:00:27.960> choose<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
b-flat and basically we'll choose a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.540 
b-flat and basically we'll choose a
chord<00:00:29.130> voicings<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.619> we'll<00:00:31.619> also<00:00:31.800> choose<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
chord voicings and we'll also choose a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.350 
chord voicings and we'll also choose a
specific<00:00:33.180> rhythm<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.290> play<00:00:34.500> throughout<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
specific rhythm to play throughout the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.619 
specific rhythm to play throughout the
12<00:00:36.360> bar<00:00:36.630> blues<00:00:36.660> form<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.030> case<00:00:39.300> let's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
12 bar blues form so for this case let's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:01:16.940 
12 bar blues form so for this case let's
take<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> rhythm<00:00:40.260> like<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.229> forth

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
take a rhythm like and so forth

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
take a rhythm like and so forth
whatever<00:01:17.640> whatever<00:01:17.939> rhythmic<00:01:18.570> pattern<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
whatever whatever rhythmic pattern you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.060 
whatever whatever rhythmic pattern you
can<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.790> go<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:23.009> know

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
can think of go for that and you know

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.760 
can think of go for that and you know
practice<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.729> by<00:01:23.970> looping<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
practice it by looping in it and so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.230 
practice it by looping in it and so
forth<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.710> slightly<00:01:29.490> more<00:01:29.610> advanced<00:01:30.000> way

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
forth and the slightly more advanced way

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.390 
forth and the slightly more advanced way
is<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:32.630> vary<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> rhythm<00:01:33.960> rhythm<00:01:34.350> bar<00:01:35.159> by

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
is you can vary the rhythm rhythm bar by

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.120 
is you can vary the rhythm rhythm bar by
bar<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.810> example<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> first<00:01:37.920> two

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
bar so for example for the first two

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
bar so for example for the first two
bars<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.729> play<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:40.259> same<00:01:40.500> rhythm<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
bars you can play the same rhythm and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.060 
bars you can play the same rhythm and
then<00:01:41.040> change<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> next<00:01:42.180> two<00:01:42.390> bars<00:01:43.070> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
then change it for the next two bars so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
then change it for the next two bars so
it's<00:01:44.220> something<00:01:44.490> like

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.870 

yeah<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> even<00:02:01.259> bar<00:02:01.740> by<00:02:01.920> bar<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.460> change

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
yeah you even bar by bar you can change

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.990 
yeah you even bar by bar you can change
the<00:02:03.149> rhythm<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:04.280> pretty<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.429> whatever<00:02:05.640> if

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the rhythm up pretty much whatever if

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
the rhythm up pretty much whatever if
it's<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.360> solo<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:09.509> yeah<00:02:09.629> that's<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:10.049> of<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's the solo and yeah that's kind of a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.839 
it's the solo and yeah that's kind of a
basic<00:02:11.069> lesson<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.840> rhythmic<00:02:12.840> comping<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.849> hope
