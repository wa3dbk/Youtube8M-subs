00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.130 

started<00:00:24.760> a<00:00:24.880> series<00:00:25.090> of<00:00:25.390> studies<00:00:25.630> where<00:00:26.110> I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
started a series of studies where I

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.890 
started a series of studies where I
asked<00:00:26.560> about<00:00:27.040> their<00:00:27.250> impressions<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.360> a<00:00:28.510> robot

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
asked about their impressions of a robot

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.050 
asked about their impressions of a robot
when<00:00:29.290> they<00:00:29.410> thought<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.620> a<00:00:29.800> robot<00:00:29.980> had<00:00:30.700> life

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
when they thought that a robot had life

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.510 
when they thought that a robot had life
and<00:00:31.720> possessed<00:00:31.869> human<00:00:32.529> characteristics<00:00:33.340> and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
and possessed human characteristics and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.940 
and possessed human characteristics and
I<00:00:34.030> was<00:00:34.210> very<00:00:34.450> surprised<00:00:35.320> if<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:35.710> have<00:00:35.860> the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
I was very surprised if I have the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.530 
I was very surprised if I have the
majority<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.370> children<00:00:36.580> in<00:00:36.850> our<00:00:36.970> study<00:00:37.210> said

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
majority of children in our study said

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.270 
majority of children in our study said
that<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:38.200> they<00:00:38.320> thought<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:38.950> robot

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
that that they thought that the robot

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.540 
that that they thought that the robot
could<00:00:39.489> feel<00:00:39.730> embarrassment<00:00:40.800> sadness<00:00:41.800> her

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
could feel embarrassment sadness her

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.150 
could feel embarrassment sadness her
fear<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.420> also<00:00:44.320> could<00:00:44.530> engage<00:00:44.800> in<00:00:45.010> certain

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
fear and also could engage in certain

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.770 
fear and also could engage in certain
kinds<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.520> behaviors<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.059> clearly<00:00:46.480> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
kinds of behaviors that clearly the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.890 
kinds of behaviors that clearly the
robot<00:00:47.080> didn't<00:00:47.290> have<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.590> capability<00:00:48.340> for<00:00:48.900> so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
robot didn't have the capability for so

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.750 
robot didn't have the capability for so
that<00:00:50.170> encouraged<00:00:50.860> me<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.190> perhaps<00:00:51.370> there

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
that encouraged me that perhaps there

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.950 
that encouraged me that perhaps there
could<00:00:51.820> be<00:00:52.000> some<00:00:52.360> other<00:00:52.390> types<00:00:52.809> of

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
could be some other types of

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.110 
could be some other types of
applications<00:00:53.650> for<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.010> robot<00:00:54.399> that<00:00:54.700> have<00:00:54.970> never

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
applications for a robot that have never

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.510 
applications for a robot that have never
been<00:00:55.390> considered<00:00:55.780> before<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.500> with<00:00:57.100> my<00:00:57.280> role

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
been considered before and with my role

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.280 
been considered before and with my role
as<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.820> professor<00:00:58.450> in<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.810> Faculty<00:00:59.260> of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
as a professor in the Faculty of

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.410 
as a professor in the Faculty of
Medicine<00:00:59.530> I<00:01:00.010> thought<00:01:00.550> naturally<00:01:01.120> about

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
Medicine I thought naturally about

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.620 
Medicine I thought naturally about
patients<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.230> patient<00:01:02.680> care<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.630> realize

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
patients and patient care and realize

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.660 
patients and patient care and realize
that<00:01:04.660> from<00:01:05.560> reading<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.860> research<00:01:06.070> we<00:01:06.490> know

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
that from reading the research we know

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.850 
that from reading the research we know
that<00:01:06.910> fifty<00:01:07.630> percent<00:01:07.930> of<00:01:08.110> children<00:01:08.290> have

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
that fifty percent of children have

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.490 
that fifty percent of children have
severe<00:01:09.490> stress<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.509> anxiety<00:01:10.630> when<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.229> comes

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
severe stress and anxiety when it comes

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.350 
severe stress and anxiety when it comes
to<00:01:11.710> needles<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.190> as<00:01:12.729> adults<00:01:12.970> they're

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
to needles and as adults they're

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.510 
to needles and as adults they're
unlikely<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.990> access<00:01:14.470> health<00:01:14.710> care<00:01:14.979> system

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
unlikely to access health care system

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.219 
unlikely to access health care system
and<00:01:15.670> services<00:01:16.210> when<00:01:16.540> they<00:01:16.840> have<00:01:16.990> health

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
and services when they have health

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.859 
and services when they have health
problems<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.820> those<00:01:19.030> negative<00:01:19.780> emotions

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
problems and so those negative emotions

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.170 
problems and so those negative emotions
and<00:01:20.470> childhood<00:01:20.830> may<00:01:21.280> linger<00:01:21.640> well<00:01:21.910> into

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
and childhood may linger well into

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.180 
and childhood may linger well into
adulthood<00:01:22.410> so<00:01:23.410> that's<00:01:23.619> when<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:23.830> start<00:01:24.160> to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
adulthood so that's when I start to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.889 
adulthood so that's when I start to
wonder<00:01:24.250> if<00:01:24.610> perhaps<00:01:24.759> we<00:01:25.210> can<00:01:25.360> introduce<00:01:25.660> a

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
wonder if perhaps we can introduce a

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.530 
wonder if perhaps we can introduce a
robot<00:01:26.260> as<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.619> way<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.280> distracting<00:01:27.880> children

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
robot as a way of distracting children

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.280 
robot as a way of distracting children
during<00:01:28.810> some<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.229> those<00:01:29.320> or<00:01:30.130> uncomfortable

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
during some of those or uncomfortable

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.590 
during some of those or uncomfortable
painful<00:01:32.290> all<00:01:32.350> kinds<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.799> procedures<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.420> the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
painful all kinds of procedures so the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.570 
painful all kinds of procedures so the
robot<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.049> a<00:01:35.080> different<00:01:35.950> way<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.430> have

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
robot is a different way that we have

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.260 
robot is a different way that we have
used<00:01:36.790> other<00:01:37.030> methods<00:01:37.720> as<00:01:37.900> well<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.700> just

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
used other methods as well that just

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.410 
used other methods as well that just
causes<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.900> distraction<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.040> child

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
causes the distraction of the child

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.789 
causes the distraction of the child
potentially<00:01:43.420> pretty<00:01:43.659> powerful<00:01:44.020> distraction

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
potentially pretty powerful distraction

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
potentially pretty powerful distraction
with<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> lot<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.280> different<00:01:45.520> applications

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
with a lot of different applications

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.890 
with a lot of different applications
that<00:01:47.799> can<00:01:48.040> first<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.729> all<00:01:48.850> engage<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.659> Chop

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
that can first of all engage the Chop

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.450 
that can first of all engage the Chop
most<00:01:50.229> such<00:01:50.350> types<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.830> distractions<00:01:51.369> and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
most such types of distractions and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.070 
most such types of distractions and
we've<00:01:51.610> used<00:01:51.820> before<00:01:52.000> are<00:01:52.360> usually<00:01:52.659> things<00:01:52.869> at

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
we've used before are usually things at

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.420 
we've used before are usually things at
the<00:01:53.320> chance<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.680> try<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:53.950> take<00:01:54.250> their

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
the chance to try to take their

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.210 
the chance to try to take their
attention<00:01:54.520> away<00:01:54.939> but<00:01:55.840> what<00:01:56.170> this<00:01:56.619> was<00:01:56.830> able<00:01:57.100> to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
attention away but what this was able to

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.060 
attention away but what this was able to
do<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:57.700> also<00:01:58.090> us<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.540> have<00:01:58.720> kind<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.049> a<00:01:59.140> preamble

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
do is also us to have kind of a preamble

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.980 
do is also us to have kind of a preamble
kind<00:02:00.370> of<00:02:00.430> get<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.850> child<00:02:01.180> into<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.570> room<00:02:01.780> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
kind of get the child into the room and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.610 
kind of get the child into the room and
as<00:02:02.409> they<00:02:02.620> get<00:02:02.770> settled<00:02:03.220> into<00:02:03.400> their<00:02:03.610> place<00:02:04.620> to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
as they get settled into their place to

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.649 
as they get settled into their place to
make<00:02:05.920> them<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> little<00:02:06.400> bit<00:02:06.610> more<00:02:06.820> at<00:02:06.940> ease<00:02:07.150> that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
make them a little bit more at ease that

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.419 
make them a little bit more at ease that
obviously<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.259> distraction<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:09.130> goes<00:02:09.280> on

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
obviously is a distraction that goes on

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.040 
obviously is a distraction that goes on
during<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.270> time<00:02:10.479> they're<00:02:10.660> actually<00:02:10.959> getting

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
during the time they're actually getting

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.660 
during the time they're actually getting
the<00:02:11.320> injection<00:02:11.800> but<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.370> there's<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the injection but then there's the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.400 
the injection but then there's the
aftermath<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.390> well<00:02:13.600> where<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.110> again
