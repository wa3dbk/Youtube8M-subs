00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.559
 through early stimulation today 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.230
 let's talk about stimulation games 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.210
 early we know that by playing 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 you can stimulate the intelligence of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.880
 children there are specific toys 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.449
 to stimulate different areas but 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.479
 we can also improvise games with 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.390
 simple elements that we have at home when 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:35.489
 reach of the hand you have to be creative 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.920
 and good to look for games to be able 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.180
 stimulate our children and that they 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 grow happier and smarter 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 to stimulate touch for example in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 different stages you can wear clothes 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 soft fabrics mass fruit flowers clay 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.440
 mud sand rag dolls chains and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.710
 all different textures so that everything 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 and can experience the brightness 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 hard to watch the colors is good 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 amount of things the touch is one of the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.740
 most developed senses of the baby to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.500
 through birth and the baby receive 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.869
 amount of information and many 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.030
 stimuli the moment of bathing by 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.640
 example is a very good experience 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 for the video to drop drops on 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 his head like playing also after 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.729
 to dry it with the hair dryer 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.800
 make him feel the warm air on his 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.170

 techniques include paper colors of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 magazines or aluminum foil which is very 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.150
 striking for the puppet mirrors 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.670

 stroller in front of a window if it is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.110
 you come in front of a park or 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.780
 they have a garden so the mediator 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.520
 flowers or just pass the cars 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 they entertain and stimulate 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.709
 very much the vision also another game 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.040
 what can be done is to put yourself with your 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.640
 son in front of the mirror and play approaching 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 and get away from getting closer and away 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.490
 to have a lot of fun and at the beginning it does not go 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.620
 to recognize if it's too small like that 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.110
 He takes it off in front of the mirror but it 's a 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.959
 very funny game that they like a lot 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.700
 what gives them a lot of curiosity and good 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.820
 can be done by blowjobs with the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.180
 dad with the brother can be made from to 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.920
 two use the paper we said colorful 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.160
 aluminum to make boats 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.510
 fans different ways if you do a 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.569
 little bit bigger you can leave 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.250
 cut out that they love them and then 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.290
 there are also techniques to stimulate the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.420
 ear to stimulate the ear 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.580
 we can use the same cell phone that we use 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.130
 to stimulate the view with music 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.540
 we can use snails other toys 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.390
 with echoes rattles of different size 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.769
 all kinds of musical instruments 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.200
 drums, bells things that are 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.410
 easy to play you are guys that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.480
 want to hit that is to move bracelets 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.380
 Anklets that sound when he moves 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.910
 the laughter the singing the conversation I do not know 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.580
 of engravings with mom's voice 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.470
 same can be babies right away 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.410
 begins to be interested in sounds and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.020
 the non- saline words of nature 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.990
 of the street of the house are own or 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.940
 mine calls you a lot of attention for 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.430
 do homemade things with elements that 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.410
 there are usually in some house in almost 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.250
 all the houses can be filled 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.790
 balloons tinitas with summers of rice by 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.310
 example or jingle bells to sound and 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.770
 the child when he moves them sets his 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.380
 sounds and those different sounds will go 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.080
 developing the meaning of life with 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.570
 respect to music specifically there 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.970
 in this same channel a video where 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.010
 explains the importance of it in the 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.440
 early stimulation do not miss it 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.050
 that is very interesting music is 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.870
 very important the stimulation of the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.450
 boy 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.640
 and also develops different senses 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.980
 The subject is exciting so 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.510
 I recommend that you see ideas for the 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.240
 balance that also has to do with 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.060
 the bark we play with hammocks with ups 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.210
 and get off with rocking horses with 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.160
 amount of those things where he 'll go 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.320
 keeping the balance those balls 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.540
 big ones that can climb up on the bone 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.880
 upside down keep your balance now 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.520
 all that helps a lot 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.350
 and also stimulate the taste we can 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.570
 do it when he starts with the 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.430
 first experiences in the meals more 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.710
 or less than six months can be 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.020
 play with the east to try 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.560
 different types of apples for example 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.560
 they are separated by colors by 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.440
 likes first front I look at it 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.780
 that bites leave it to the explorer 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.360
 that he experiences then he is 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.660
 try the pieces we're not going to do 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.490
 with different types of vegetables 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.760
 mixing colors so that you call the 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.850
 attention and can associate for example 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.250
 carrot broccoli potato everything has 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.560
 different color and longer 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.510
 we can play to guess for the pleasure of 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.270
 what food is it if it's sweet and 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.250
 salty and it's bitter if it's acid too 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.510
 set life to associate a name 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.310
 for an adjective for each sensation is 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.310
 very important the same thing we are going to do 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.580
 for the juices put them in equal cups 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.290
 and opaque and try them without children 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.870
 they have to try without seeing them and they can 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.830
 taste guess 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.740
 of fruit if it is a good soda if it is 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.720
