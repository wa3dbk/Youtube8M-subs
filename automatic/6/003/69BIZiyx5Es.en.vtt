00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
much easier to work with especially for

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.389 
much easier to work with especially for
a<00:01:44.850> beginner<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> roll<00:01:46.530> dough<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.189> I'm

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
a beginner when I roll dough if I'm

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
a beginner when I roll dough if I'm
trying<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> circle<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.710> finished

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
trying to get a circle as the finished

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.789 
trying to get a circle as the finished
product<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.820> start<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> circle<00:01:52.649> which

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
product I start out with a circle which

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.940 
product I start out with a circle which
is<00:01:53.009> why<00:01:53.250> these<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.610> somewhat<00:01:54.540> round<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.680> best

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is why these are somewhat round the best

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
is why these are somewhat round the best
thing<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> keep<00:01:57.030> turning<00:01:57.659> your

will<00:02:03.920> not<00:02:04.100> stick<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.180> just<00:02:05.450> keep

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
will not stick and then just keep

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.969 
will not stick and then just keep

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.640 
remember these aren't supposed to look
perfect<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.819> don't<00:02:26.720> worry<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.380> fruit

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
perfect so don't worry if the fruit

isn't in a perfect little circle it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.839 
isn't in a perfect little circle it
doesn't<00:02:30.379> matter<00:02:30.500> by<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> time<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.400> gets<00:02:31.519> baked

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
doesn't matter by the time it gets baked

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
best part about making pies like this it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.550 
best part about making pies like this it
doesn't<00:02:37.640> matter<00:02:37.790> if<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.239> perfect<00:02:38.690> or<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:38.989> so

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
doesn't matter if it's perfect or not so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.670 
doesn't matter if it's perfect or not so
you're<00:02:39.739> just<00:02:40.010> going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.400> gently<00:02:40.610> fold<00:02:41.239> up<00:02:41.680> some

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
you're just going to gently fold up some

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.589 
you're just going to gently fold up some
of<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.950> filling<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.519> start<00:02:43.849> with<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.299> piece

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
of the filling you start with one piece

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.650 
of the filling you start with one piece
and<00:02:44.900> then<00:02:45.470> just<00:02:45.769> keep<00:02:45.950> folding<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.150> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
and then just keep folding and you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.850 
and then just keep folding and you
overlap<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:49.370> keep<00:02:49.579> overlapping<00:02:50.739> until<00:02:51.739> you

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
overlap just keep overlapping until you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.460 
overlap just keep overlapping until you
finally<00:02:52.130> come<00:02:52.549> up<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.120> end<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:54.440> you

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
finally come up to the end and then you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.819 
finally come up to the end and then you
just<00:02:54.769> bring<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.239> that's<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.690> see<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
just bring it in and that's it see it

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.220 
just bring it in and that's it see it
makes<00:02:58.099> like<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.430> pocket<00:02:58.760> there's<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.720> little<00:02:59.989> bit

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
makes like a pocket there's a little bit

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.440 
makes like a pocket there's a little bit
of<00:03:00.290> an<00:03:00.530> opening<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.220> let<00:03:01.430> some<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.849> steam

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
of an opening to let some of that steam

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.680 
of an opening to let some of that steam
escape<00:03:03.109> so<00:03:03.709> one<00:03:03.980> hopefully<00:03:04.819> won't<00:03:05.060> burst<00:03:05.359> it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
escape so one hopefully won't burst it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.629 
escape so one hopefully won't burst it
and<00:03:06.680> we're<00:03:06.799> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.950> brush<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.310> with<00:03:07.519> a

and we're going to brush it with a
little<00:03:07.880> bit<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.120> egg<00:03:08.359> wash<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:09.680> going<00:03:09.859> to<00:03:09.950> add

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
little bit of egg wash it's going to add

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.729 
little bit of egg wash it's going to add
a<00:03:10.639> little<00:03:10.940> bit<00:03:11.389> of<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.569> shine<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.500> going

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
a little bit of a shine to it it's going

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.160 
a little bit of a shine to it it's going
to<00:03:12.829> help<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.220> color<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:14.750> going<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> give

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
to help it color and it's going to give

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.809 
to help it color and it's going to give
these<00:03:15.350> sugar<00:03:15.739> crystals<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.310> we're<00:03:16.519> going<00:03:16.700> to

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
these sugar crystals that we're going to

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.490 
these sugar crystals that we're going to
be<00:03:16.910> putting<00:03:17.060> on<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.569> moment<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.139> way<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.889> stick

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
be putting on in a moment a way to stick

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.140 
be putting on in a moment a way to stick
and<00:03:21.500> once<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:21.889> get<00:03:22.040> all<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.549> egg<00:03:22.670> wash<00:03:22.910> on

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
and once we get all of the egg wash on

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.780 
and once we get all of the egg wash on
we<00:03:23.569> just<00:03:23.780> take<00:03:24.019> some<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.350> these<00:03:24.500> pretty<00:03:25.489> sugar

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
we just take some of these pretty sugar

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.660 
we just take some of these pretty sugar
crystals<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.540> just<00:03:26.720> sprinkle<00:03:27.019> them<00:03:27.290> around

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
crystals and just sprinkle them around

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.580 
crystals and just sprinkle them around
you<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:29.060> use<00:03:29.120> regular<00:03:29.329> table<00:03:29.959> sugar<00:03:30.319> and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
you can just use regular table sugar and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.470 
you can just use regular table sugar and
it'll<00:03:30.769> be<00:03:30.889> fine<00:03:31.190> now<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.970> we've<00:03:32.090> got<00:03:32.329> these
