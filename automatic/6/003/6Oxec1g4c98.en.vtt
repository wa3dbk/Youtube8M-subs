my in the previous I was talking about
these<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.519> pulley<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.929> motor<00:00:32.090> alright

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
these the pulley and the motor alright

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.180 
these the pulley and the motor alright
I<00:00:34.040> finally<00:00:35.040> found<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.850> bender<00:00:36.829> that<00:00:37.829> would

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I finally found a bender that would

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
I finally found a bender that would

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
emails and I got a two and a half inch

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
emails and I got a two and a half inch
pulley<00:00:46.070> timing<00:00:47.070> gear<00:00:47.340> pulley<00:00:48.020> here<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.700> one

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
pulley timing gear pulley here and a one

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.760 
pulley timing gear pulley here and a one
inch<00:00:51.469> drive<00:00:52.469> pulley<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:55.320> was

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
inch drive pulley over there that was

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.029 
inch drive pulley over there that was
only<00:00:56.190> available<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> half<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.809> inch<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
only available at a half an inch so I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.230 
only available at a half an inch so I
had<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> bore<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:04.220> five-eighths<00:01:05.240> but

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
had a bore it out to five-eighths but

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.380 
had a bore it out to five-eighths but
because<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> boring<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.280> had<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.820> weld<00:01:09.090> up

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
because of the boring I had to weld up

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.010 
because of the boring I had to weld up
the<00:01:10.110> top<00:01:10.470> portion<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.450> wall<00:01:18.689> would

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the top portion here the the wall would

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
the top portion here the the wall would
have<00:01:19.140> been<00:01:19.290> too<00:01:19.530> thin<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:21.270> had<00:01:22.070> welded<00:01:23.070> up

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
have been too thin so I had welded up

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.530 
have been too thin so I had welded up
and<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.869> drilled<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> set<00:01:25.710> screw<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
and then we drilled the set screw and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.190 
and then we drilled the set screw and
and<00:01:27.680> tap<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.640> quarter<00:01:30.270> twenty<00:01:30.450> set<00:01:30.869> screw

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and tap it to a quarter twenty set screw

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
and tap it to a quarter twenty set screw
and<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.540> ordered<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and on this I ordered it to be in a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.640 
and on this I ordered it to be in a
three<00:01:36.630> inch<00:01:36.840> drive<00:01:39.170> drive

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
three inch drive drive

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.539 
three inch drive drive
so<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> had<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.570> put<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> sleeve<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
so I had to put a sleeve in this and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
so I had to put a sleeve in this and
then<00:01:44.990> bore<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:48.540> fit<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.270> 3/8<00:01:51.270> drive

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
then bore it to fit the the 3/8 drive

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
then bore it to fit the the 3/8 drive
shaft<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.979> transmission<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
shaft on the transmission if you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
shaft on the transmission if you
remember<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> three-speed

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
remember this is a three-speed

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.749 
remember this is a three-speed
transmission<00:01:56.369> here's<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> lever<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:59.070> shift

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
transmission here's the lever to shift

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
transmission here's the lever to shift
it<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.840> right<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> low-speed<00:02:02.009> right

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it and it's right in the low-speed right

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.910 
it and it's right in the low-speed right
now<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.509> seems<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.320> pretty<00:02:04.649> good

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
now and that seems to be a pretty good

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.910 
now and that seems to be a pretty good
position

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
position

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.710

snap latch and then you just unhook it

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.350 
snap latch and then you just unhook it
boom<00:04:50.390> there<00:04:50.930> as<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.290> drop<00:04:51.590> out<00:04:51.970> now<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.030> only

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
boom there as you drop out now the only

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
thing is I gotta get some rubber gasket

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.160 
thing is I gotta get some rubber gasket
material<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.610> put<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.090> rubber<00:05:02.330> gasket<00:05:02.600> all<00:05:03.050> the

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
material and put a rubber gasket all the

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.770 
material and put a rubber gasket all the
way<00:05:03.320> around<00:05:03.620> because<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.790> sand<00:05:05.090> is<00:05:05.300> coming

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
way around because the sand is coming

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.660 
way around because the sand is coming
out<00:05:05.930> through<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.470> sides<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.600> is<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:10.370> is

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
out through the sides so that is that is

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:18.190 
out through the sides so that is that is
something<00:05:10.940> I<00:05:11.300> still<00:05:11.360> have<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:12.080> do<00:05:12.260> yet<00:05:17.200> that

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
something I still have to do yet that

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.980 
something I still have to do yet that
just<00:05:18.500> snaps<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:19.820> just<00:05:20.180> snaps<00:05:20.270> shut<00:05:20.780> like

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
just snaps that just snaps shut like

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.130 
just snaps that just snaps shut like
that<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:23.230> basically<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:26.000> whole<00:05:26.330> unit<00:05:26.840> is

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
that so basically this whole unit is

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:34.630 
that so basically this whole unit is
done<00:05:27.820> now<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:30.560> big<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:32.150> big<00:05:32.420> test<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.640> I'll

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
done now the big the big test and I'll

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.490 
done now the big the big test and I'll
warn<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.240> right<00:05:35.300> now<00:05:35.890> this<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.840> tank<00:05:39.170> is<00:05:39.380> a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
warn you right now this the tank is a

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.930 
warn you right now this the tank is a
little<00:05:39.830> bit<00:05:39.980> out<00:05:40.220> of<00:05:40.580> round<00:05:41.710> so<00:05:42.710> I'm<00:05:43.040> gonna<00:05:43.490> I

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
little bit out of round so I'm gonna I

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.230 
little bit out of round so I'm gonna I
put<00:05:44.630> one<00:05:44.840> band<00:05:45.140> around<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.650> top<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:47.030> I'm

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
put one band around the top and I'm

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.940 
put one band around the top and I'm
going<00:05:47.390> to<00:05:47.450> put<00:05:47.630> another<00:05:47.930> band<00:05:48.230> here<00:05:48.740> and

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
going to put another band here and

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.470 
going to put another band here and
another<00:05:49.250> band<00:05:49.490> down<00:05:49.820> here

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
another band down here

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.040 
another band down here
to<00:05:52.210> try<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:53.420> get<00:05:53.690> it

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
to try and get it

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.810 
to try and get it
so<00:05:54.380> it's<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:55.090> more<00:05:56.090> uniform<00:05:57.460> but<00:05:58.460> let<00:05:58.700> me

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
so it's it's more uniform but let me
