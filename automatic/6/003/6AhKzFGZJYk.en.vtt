under<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> dock<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:51.410> looking<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.710> if

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
under the dock just looking to see if

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
under the dock just looking to see if
there's<00:00:52.949> any<00:00:53.100> bass<00:00:53.370> hiding<00:00:53.850> under<00:00:54.090> there

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:28.460 

very<00:01:11.170> very<00:01:11.350> she'll<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.720> want<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.080> try<00:01:14.320> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 

I<00:01:28.620> think<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> barrier<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.390> there

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
I think they have that barrier up there

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.150 
I think they have that barrier up there
on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> dock<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.440> they<00:01:31.800> don't<00:01:31.980> want

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
on the dock because they don't want

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.910 
on the dock because they don't want
anybody<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:32.760> walk<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.480> there

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
anybody to actually walk out there

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.230 
anybody to actually walk out there
because<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.010> think<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.850> under

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
because I think it's actually under

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.260 
because I think it's actually under
repair

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
