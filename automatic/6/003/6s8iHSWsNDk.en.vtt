00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.080
 the process of obtaining a 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.490
 residence authorization with a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.549
 Community scheme of a card 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.190
 community begins naturally with the 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.860
 arrival in Spain of the citizen or 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.470
 foreign citizen's relative 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.220
 Community in some cases the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.919
 Community citizen and his family already 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.490
 will be in Spain but we are going to 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.220
 start this video with the assumption in 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.649
 which the citizen the family member of 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.289
 Community citizen is not in 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.020
 Spain but that is in your country of 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.520
 origin the typical case for example of 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.039
 Spanish citizens of the union 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.039
 European who is married to a citizen 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.989
 foreigner and that or the citizen 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.570
 Spanish is already in Spain or that 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 both come to Spain 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 to fix your address here and to request 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.160
 this community card in these cases 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.970
 will be necessary in some cases not in 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.400
 everyone 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.850
 request the corresponding visa 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.360
 family member of a community resident in what 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.090
 cases you have to ask for this visa well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 in all those in all cases 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.080
 except for those citizens who are 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 of in a nationality for which no 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.899
 short stay visa is required 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.700
 duration in Spain for example so that 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.530
 you understand me if a citizen 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 Colombian is required to get to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.960
 Spain a short-term visa 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.600
 cheng in pesos that are requested in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 consulate of Spain in the event that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.740
 that Colombian citizen is a family member of 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.690
 a community and want to reach our 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 country will need to ask for a visa 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.649
 of a community regime but that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.050
 citizen if instead of being Colombian it is 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.009
 Argentina to the Argentines are not 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.009
 requires a short- term visa for 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.690
 get to Spain and therefore neither 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.050
 it will be necessary 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.450
 Obtaining a regime visa 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.790
 community to get to Spain 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.310
 object to stay to live the difference 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.960
 fundamental since in the case of 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.660
 citizens who are required 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.330
 visa will have for necessarily 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.890
 enter Spain make an application for 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.710
 a visa in the Community scheme of 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.600
 family community and in the case of 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.150
 those citizens who are not 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.030
 Visa requirement would directly come to 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.920
 Spain without the need for this visa but 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.050
 yes, gifted with all those 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 documents will carry with them all 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.420
 documents as they prove that the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.530
 object of the entry is to come here 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.270
 to meet or what accompanies your 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.270
 community family
