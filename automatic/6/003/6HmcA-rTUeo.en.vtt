disorder<00:00:52.829> Braun<00:00:53.070> real<00:00:53.340> fast<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.420> that's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
disorder Braun real fast so that's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.260

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
kennel is he you know enters the door so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
kennel is he you know enters the door so
it's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.949> repetitious<00:01:01.949> thing<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:03.030> probably

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it's a repetitious thing and I probably

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
it's a repetitious thing and I probably
worked<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> dog<00:01:04.439> doing<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.220> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
worked with the dog doing this this is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.179 
worked with the dog doing this this is
probably<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.409> third<00:01:07.409> session<00:01:07.830> or

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
probably about the third session or

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
probably about the third session or
something<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.729> had<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.020> like<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.229> minutes

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
something I had to like two minutes

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.730 
something I had to like two minutes
sessions<00:01:10.770> doing<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
sessions doing this and so you know you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
sessions doing this and so you know you
just<00:01:14.070> keep<00:01:14.280> doing<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.790> until<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
just keep doing it until you know you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
just keep doing it until you know you
make<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> game<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.549> know

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
make a game out of it and you know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
make a game out of it and you know
honestly<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.479> game<00:01:18.689> becomes<00:01:19.590> more

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
honestly the game becomes more

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
honestly the game becomes more
complicated<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.229> becomes<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
complicated as you go so it becomes the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
complicated as you go so it becomes the
dog<00:01:22.890> sits<00:01:23.369> before<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.450> goes<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.170> kennel

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
dog sits before it goes into the kennel

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550 
dog sits before it goes into the kennel
you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.930> how<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.110> train<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you know it's it's just how you train a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
you know it's it's just how you train a
dog<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.880> something

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
