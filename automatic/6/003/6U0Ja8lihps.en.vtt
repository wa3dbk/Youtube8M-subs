00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello to all guys oils or are 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 nevermind and welcome to this video 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.969
 I start by telling you that this video is 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 I concentrate only on the pre for suit 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 edition that for those who do not know is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.470
 the edition has been temporarily released for PC 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 then it will obviously also come out for consoles 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 which includes new new play areas 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 npc enemy bosses etcetera etc. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.700
 however, since I believe that access to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 these these new areas these new 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.690
 areas is not very intuitive 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 we say that it is not difficult but it is not 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.770
 intuitive I decided to make a video one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.680
 video guide to help all those 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.020
 players and how they found me are 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.750
 finding it difficult to access these 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 new areas before starting to tell you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.050
 all procedures to get to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 these new areas 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 I want to thank saab e 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.559
 knicks machine a youtube user who 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.449
 treats him of dark just like me that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.859
 allowed me to use some of his 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 video to complete this mine 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.090
 videoguide since some parts me 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 I had already overcome it and it was me 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 obviously impossible to show you the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 his channel can be found in the description 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.520
 so let's go first with order 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.250
 you guys must have finished the area already 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 give orlando then including the bosses e 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 having received receptacle of the lords 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.250
 you will also have to have placed it for whom 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.680
 did not know this object me 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.259
 allows you to teleport from a lighthouse 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 to the other taken the receptacle you will have to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.400
 head to the dark root basin and if 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.400
 you haven't done it yet you will have to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.220
 kill the hydra once killed listed 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.650
 from the game re-enter and walk the side 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 left of the lake as I am doing myself or 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.630
 better as it is letting know once 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 traveled across the left bank of the lake 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 you will arrive in a kind of crotta a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.649
 ravine where you will meet a golem of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 orange crystal flight kill and from 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.030
 the latter will come out a woman dressed in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 white that will tell you about times gone by and 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.650
 will tell you that if you need her 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.600
 you can summon it 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.790
 once the woman knows the disappearance 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.620
 it does of the path to the contrary you will find 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.600
 his sign of vocation close to one 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.570
 rock on the shore where you killed 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.720
 the hydra summoned will sell me some things 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.550
 and then head catan orlando from the bonfire 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.860
 of anne orlando turned to the left towards 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.720
 the archives of the duke and kill 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.150
 any way you stand in front of it 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.640
 pay close attention to the new golem of 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.710
 blue crystal that will be there in part 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.920
 in the first instances of these archives e 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.390
 you do not have to kill you Agerer 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 once killed this golem of 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.400
 blue crystal the latter will give you 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.980
 the pendant object broke this object 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.230
 allows you to access the new areas 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.330
 of game but where should one go 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.120
 once picked up this broken pendant for 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.340
 access these new areas then you 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.959
 you must go to the basin in the dark root 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.630
 again where to arrive practically 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.250
 where to have killed the orange golem 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.680
 the crystal one, in short, where it came out 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.510
 the woman there next to part you'll find 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.760
 the objects of women dress them 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.430
 you will also find a kind of black hole 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.090
 a portal you click on it 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.090
 examined 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.499

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.980
 and behold, you guys would have arrived 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.630
 in the new areas of dark souls I know the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.350
 procedure as I said is not much 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.360
 hard 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.690
 only that it is not intuitive from 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.120
 running is not very easy though 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.860
 simple enough i hope this 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.540
