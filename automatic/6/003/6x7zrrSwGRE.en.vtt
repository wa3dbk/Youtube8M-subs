00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
hair but what I personally do is I put

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.580 
hair but what I personally do is I put
my<00:03:19.060> conditioner<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.690> my<00:03:19.750> hair<00:03:19.840> whichever<00:03:20.380> one

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
I happen to be using on that day and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.730 
I happen to be using on that day and
then<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.840> brush<00:03:23.020> through<00:03:23.170> my<00:03:23.260> hair<00:03:23.350> in<00:03:23.710> the

then I brush through my hair in the
shower<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.490> what<00:03:25.210> that<00:03:25.360> does<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.840> because<00:03:26.410> the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
shower and what that does is because the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.470 
shower and what that does is because the
conditioner<00:03:27.340> kind<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.640> loosens<00:03:28.000> up<00:03:28.150> your<00:03:28.300> hair

makes it very slippery you can brush
through<00:03:30.610> all<00:03:31.000> of<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.270> little<00:03:31.420> tangles<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.110> the

before when I was doing my hair before
my<00:04:38.840> makeup<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.380> would<00:04:39.500> just<00:04:39.950> put<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.550> my

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
my makeup I would just put this in my

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.250 
my makeup I would just put this in my
hair<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.060> then<00:04:41.150> I'd<00:04:41.300> like<00:04:41.510> massage<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.110> into

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
hair and then I'd like massage it into

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.200 
hair and then I'd like massage it into
my<00:04:42.440> hands<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.010> then<00:04:43.220> I'd<00:04:43.370> go<00:04:43.490> ahead<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:44.000> apply

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
my hands and then I'd go ahead and apply

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.720 
my hands and then I'd go ahead and apply
my<00:04:44.300> makeup<00:04:44.810> with<00:04:45.050> my<00:04:45.260> hands<00:04:45.650> so<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.010> had<00:04:46.370> lots<00:04:46.580> of

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
my makeup with my hands so I had lots of

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.760 
my makeup with my hands so I had lots of
breakouts<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.450> once<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.080> started<00:04:48.410> doing<00:04:48.650> my

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
breakouts and once I started doing my

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.950 
breakouts and once I started doing my
makeup<00:04:49.010> before<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.550> put<00:04:49.910> this<00:04:50.060> in<00:04:50.300> my<00:04:50.510> hair<00:04:50.720> I

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
makeup before I put this in my hair I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.080 
makeup before I put this in my hair I
started<00:04:51.830> noticing<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.430> my<00:04:52.490> breakouts

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
started noticing that my breakouts

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.990 
started noticing that my breakouts
really<00:04:53.480> started<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.140> reduce<00:04:54.620> in<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.520> very<00:04:55.760> big

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
really started to reduce in a very big

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.850 
really started to reduce in a very big
way<00:04:56.180> so<00:04:56.570> I'm<00:04:56.810> really<00:04:57.020> glad<00:04:57.230> that<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.530> figured
