00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
compliments to Spain because they tried

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
compliments to Spain because they tried
in<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.520> game<00:00:53.760> every<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:55.020> tried<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in this game every time they tried to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.680 
in this game every time they tried to
attack<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:56.399> were<00:00:56.460> easy<00:00:56.789> also<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.360> defend

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
attack they were easy also to defend

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.389 
attack they were easy also to defend
because<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> middle<00:00:59.280> they

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because they all go to the middle they

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
because they all go to the middle they
don't<00:00:59.579> go<00:00:59.699> over<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.940> flanks<00:01:00.329> there's<00:01:00.539> no

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
don't go over the flanks there's no

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.209 
don't go over the flanks there's no
crosses<00:01:01.109> coming<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.649> therefore<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.039> was

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
crosses coming in so therefore it was

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
crosses coming in so therefore it was
easy<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.000> Holland<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> defend<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.320> they

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
easy as a for Holland to defend but they

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.370 
easy as a for Holland to defend but they
tried<00:01:04.769> over<00:01:05.250> again<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> Holland<00:01:06.720> they<00:01:07.140> had

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
tried over again and Holland they had

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
tried over again and Holland they had
one<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> greatest<00:01:08.220> chances<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.909> Robin

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
one of the greatest chances with Robin

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020 
one of the greatest chances with Robin
and<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.570> didn't<00:01:10.250> didn't<00:01:11.250> scored<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and I didn't didn't scored at that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.960 
and I didn't didn't scored at that
moment<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.680> against<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.790> had

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
moment here it is one against one we had

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
moment here it is one against one we had
a<00:01:15.330> great<00:01:15.630> chance<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> nicked

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a great chance you could have nicked

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
a great chance you could have nicked
this<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.960> game<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.770> what

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this this this game because that's what

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
this this this game because that's what
it<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.369> could<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.509> any

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it is you could make it you know any

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
it is you could make it you know any
irony<00:01:22.409> also<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> other<00:01:22.950> attempt<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> he

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
irony also on the other attempt that he

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.320 
irony also on the other attempt that he
had<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> game<00:01:24.720> full<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.560> cards<00:01:26.119> he<00:01:27.119> could

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
had in a game full of cards he could

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
had in a game full of cards he could
have<00:01:27.420> gone<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.780> Stekelenburg<00:01:28.229> there

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
have gone down in Stekelenburg there

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.090 
have gone down in Stekelenburg there
could<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.100> taken<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.549> dive<00:01:29.759> chose<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.130 

exactly<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> moment<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.729> him<00:01:38.939> he<00:01:39.840> he

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
exactly it was the moment for him he he

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.690 
exactly it was the moment for him he he
thought<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.710> could<00:01:40.740> still<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.310> something

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
thought that he could still do something

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
thought that he could still do something
with<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.590> Casillas<00:01:43.590> sussed<00:01:44.159> him

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
with it but I think Casillas sussed him

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.120 
with it but I think Casillas sussed him
out<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:44.970> would<00:01:45.149> go<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.630> Casillas<00:01:46.350> left<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
out that he would go to Casillas left so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
out that he would go to Casillas left so
therefore<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.700> became<00:01:48.000> difficult<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.540> him

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
therefore it became difficult for him

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.889 
therefore it became difficult for him
but<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:49.979> overall<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
but you know overall I think that the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
but you know overall I think that the
whole<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.380> team<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.280> best<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
whole on this team get the best out of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.539 
whole on this team get the best out of
it<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> final<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.280> was

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it I think to get to the final it was

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
it I think to get to the final it was
there<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.820> possibility<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.500> in

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
there was a possibility I think that in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700 
there was a possibility I think that in
Holland<00:01:58.920> nobody<00:01:59.460> gonna<00:01:59.670> gonna<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
Holland nobody gonna gonna see the

Holland nobody gonna gonna see the
octopus<00:02:02.100> anymore<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.759> he<00:02:03.149> has<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> be

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
octopus anymore I think he has to be

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.630 
octopus anymore I think he has to be
very<00:02:03.570> careful<00:02:04.320> about<00:02:04.560> his<00:02:04.799> life<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.159> octopus

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
very careful about his life this octopus

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
very careful about his life this octopus

throughout<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.380> tournament<00:04:23.770> Spain<00:04:24.810> seemed

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
throughout the tournament Spain seemed

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.390 
throughout the tournament Spain seemed
to<00:04:25.990> have<00:04:26.110> another<00:04:26.380> gear<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.920> go<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.130> they

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
to have another gear to go to they

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.100 
to have another gear to go to they
weren't<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.000> their<00:04:28.120> brilliant<00:04:28.600> best<00:04:28.780> one

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
weren't that their brilliant best one

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.170 
weren't that their brilliant best one
not<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.860> warrant<00:04:30.220> but<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.460> think<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.030> most

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
not a warrant but I think that the most

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.850 
not a warrant but I think that the most
important<00:04:31.600> thing<00:04:31.750> about<00:04:31.780> Spain<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.500> that<00:04:32.710> they

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
important thing about Spain is that they

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.650 
important thing about Spain is that they
stayed<00:04:33.220> through<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.790> know<00:04:33.940> true<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.510> their

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
stayed through you know true to their

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.970 
stayed through you know true to their
strengths<00:04:35.170> and<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.410> think<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.770> always

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
strengths and I think that's always

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.920 
strengths and I think that's always
important<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.580> know<00:04:36.670> obviously<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.330> mean<00:04:37.720> such

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
important you know obviously I mean such

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.390 
important you know obviously I mean such
a<00:04:37.960> big<00:04:38.200> disappointment<00:04:38.500> opening<00:04:39.250> match

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
a big disappointment opening match

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.620 
a big disappointment opening match
against<00:04:39.700> Switzerland<00:04:39.880> even<00:04:40.420> though<00:04:40.510> they

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
against Switzerland even though they

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.060 
against Switzerland even though they
could<00:04:40.780> have<00:04:40.870> won<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.050> game<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.770> know<00:04:41.890> go

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
could have won that game you know go

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.890 
could have won that game you know go
against<00:04:42.310> Toronto<00:04:42.640> play<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.850> suppose<00:04:43.300> good

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
against Toronto play I suppose good

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.450 
against Toronto play I suppose good
defending<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.500> think<00:04:44.680> there<00:04:44.770> was<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.920> message<00:04:45.100> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
defending I think there was a message to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.860 
defending I think there was a message to
Spain<00:04:45.730> what<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.120> World<00:04:46.330> Cup<00:04:46.390> is<00:04:46.570> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.780> be

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
Spain what this World Cup is going to be

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.390 
Spain what this World Cup is going to be
about<00:04:47.080> because<00:04:47.410> they<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:47.560> they<00:04:48.010> get<00:04:48.160> so

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
about because they think they get so

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.740 
about because they think they get so
much<00:04:48.580> respect<00:04:49.030> from<00:04:49.120> other<00:04:49.330> teams<00:04:49.600> they

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
much respect from other teams they

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.180 
much respect from other teams they
understand<00:04:50.230> they<00:04:50.290> have<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.530> sit<00:04:50.740> back<00:04:50.860> because

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
understand they have to sit back because

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.580 
understand they have to sit back because
Spain<00:04:51.430> can<00:04:51.850> easily<00:04:52.300> take<00:04:52.510> them<00:04:52.720> apart<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.230> I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
Spain can easily take them apart and I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.140 
Spain can easily take them apart and I
think<00:04:54.010> they<00:04:54.130> grew<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.490> strength<00:04:54.700> at<00:04:55.000> they

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
think they grew in strength at they

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.780 
think they grew in strength at they
weren't<00:04:55.450> phenomenal<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.200> think<00:04:57.160> in<00:04:57.370> any<00:04:57.640> other

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
weren't phenomenal I think in any other

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.150 
weren't phenomenal I think in any other
matches<00:04:58.270> with<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.660> exception<00:04:59.320> tactically<00:04:59.950> I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
matches with the exception tactically I

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.380 
matches with the exception tactically I
think<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.790> will<00:05:00.940> appreciate<00:05:01.120> that

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
think you and I will appreciate that

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.540 
think you and I will appreciate that
against<00:05:01.720> Germany<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.140> wasn't<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.410> great<00:05:02.560> day<00:05:03.400> a

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
against Germany it wasn't a great day a

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.190 
against Germany it wasn't a great day a
semi-final<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.510> think<00:05:04.690> they<00:05:04.780> were<00:05:04.870> very<00:05:05.050> good

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
semi-final I think they were very good

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.010 
semi-final I think they were very good
but<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.860> know<00:05:05.980> their<00:05:06.640> key<00:05:06.910> players<00:05:07.120> weren't

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
but you know their key players weren't

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.290 
but you know their key players weren't
at<00:05:08.230> best<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.520> I'm<00:05:09.640> talking<00:05:10.000> not<00:05:10.270> just

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
at best and and I'm talking not just

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.120 
at best and and I'm talking not just
about<00:05:10.600> Torres<00:05:11.290> but<00:05:11.710> I'm<00:05:11.830> talking<00:05:12.070> about

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
about Torres but I'm talking about

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.640 
about Torres but I'm talking about
Iniesta<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:12.850> Chava<00:05:13.240> they<00:05:13.480> were<00:05:13.540> good<00:05:13.900> but<00:05:14.470> not

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
Iniesta and Chava they were good but not

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.970 
Iniesta and Chava they were good but not
great

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
great

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.740 
great
yeah<00:05:15.250> good<00:05:15.550> but<00:05:15.730> they<00:05:15.820> weren't<00:05:16.030> poor<00:05:16.480> they

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
yeah good but they weren't poor they

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.210 
yeah good but they weren't poor they
didn't<00:05:17.020> disappoint<00:05:17.530> it's<00:05:17.740> just<00:05:17.919> that<00:05:18.070> I<00:05:18.100> think

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
didn't disappoint it's just that I think

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.990 
didn't disappoint it's just that I think
we<00:05:18.520> all<00:05:18.700> expect<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.810> Spain<00:05:20.169> can<00:05:20.980> play<00:05:21.310> the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
we all expect that Spain can play the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.090 
we all expect that Spain can play the
way<00:05:22.180> that<00:05:22.510> they<00:05:23.080> did<00:05:23.140> for<00:05:23.440> example<00:05:23.500> at<00:05:23.950> Euro

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
way that they did for example at Euro

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.990 
way that they did for example at Euro
2008<00:05:24.880> well<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.360> think<00:05:25.450> what's<00:05:25.720> been<00:05:25.930> do<00:05:26.169> best<00:05:26.560> is

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
2008 well I think what's been do best is

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.100 
2008 well I think what's been do best is
getting<00:05:28.000> amongst<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:28.600> getting<00:05:29.020> behind

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
getting amongst you and getting behind

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.390 
getting amongst you and getting behind
you<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:29.620> know<00:05:29.710> they<00:05:29.830> played<00:05:30.010> a<00:05:30.040> weak<00:05:30.220> quick

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
you you know they played a weak quick

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.340 
you you know they played a weak quick
one<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.820> protect<00:05:31.600> your<00:05:31.720> own<00:05:31.810> edge<00:05:32.020> of<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.200> box

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
one to protect your own edge of the box

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.050 
one to protect your own edge of the box
and<00:05:32.560> they<00:05:32.650> get<00:05:32.800> in<00:05:32.890> behind<00:05:33.040> you<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.760> hot<00:05:33.940> you

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
that way you know and they're not really

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.520 
that way you know and they're not really
wanted<00:05:36.460> flame<00:05:36.760> balls<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.300> box<00:05:37.540> and<00:05:37.840> you

little<00:06:07.780> bit<00:06:07.960> divided<00:06:08.560> on<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:08.860> because<00:06:09.190> at

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
little bit divided on it because at

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.400 
little bit divided on it because at
first<00:06:09.789> we've<00:06:10.090> seen<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.509> great<00:06:10.780> Dutch<00:06:11.020> teams

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
first we've seen the great Dutch teams

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.980 
first we've seen the great Dutch teams
in<00:06:11.620> years<00:06:11.800> past<00:06:12.099> and<00:06:12.310> even<00:06:13.030> in<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.419> last<00:06:13.599> euros

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
in years past and even in the last euros

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.629 
in years past and even in the last euros
you<00:06:14.199> know<00:06:14.289> remember<00:06:14.680> great<00:06:15.130> wins<00:06:15.310> against

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
you know remember great wins against

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.800 
you know remember great wins against
friends<00:06:15.940> in<00:06:16.060> Italy<00:06:16.389> and<00:06:16.509> then<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.780> course

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
friends in Italy and then of course

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.350 
friends in Italy and then of course
going<00:06:17.229> out<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:18.190> Russia<00:06:18.400> surprisingly<00:06:19.120> so<00:06:19.300> I

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
going out to to Russia surprisingly so I

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.279 
going out to to Russia surprisingly so I
think<00:06:19.419> they've<00:06:19.660> changed<00:06:19.900> their<00:06:20.110> approach

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
think they've changed their approach

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.409 
think they've changed their approach
little<00:06:20.680> bit<00:06:20.830> environment<00:06:21.400> like<00:06:21.580> has<00:06:22.030> said<00:06:22.300> it

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
little bit environment like has said it

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.939 
little bit environment like has said it
that<00:06:22.509> there's<00:06:22.720> no<00:06:22.840> longer<00:06:23.050> total<00:06:23.440> football<00:06:23.770> so

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
that there's no longer total football so

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.589 
that there's no longer total football so
on<00:06:24.130> that<00:06:24.580> hand<00:06:24.819> you<00:06:24.970> got<00:06:25.090> to<00:06:25.120> give<00:06:25.300> him<00:06:25.389> some

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
on that hand you got to give him some

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.420 
on that hand you got to give him some
credit<00:06:25.720> because<00:06:26.169> they<00:06:26.380> they<00:06:26.800> have<00:06:26.830> gotten

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
credit because they they have gotten

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.460 
credit because they they have gotten
better<00:06:27.610> as<00:06:27.880> well<00:06:28.090> you<00:06:28.389> could<00:06:28.690> say<00:06:28.900> although<00:06:29.110> I

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
better as well you could say although I

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.779 
better as well you could say although I
think<00:06:30.160> we've<00:06:30.250> talked<00:06:30.460> about<00:06:30.550> they<00:06:30.759> should

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
think we've talked about they should

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:31.920 
think we've talked about they should
have<00:06:31.000> been<00:06:31.090> out<00:06:31.180> of<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:31.360> tournament<00:06:31.750> against

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
have been out of the tournament against

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.159 
have been out of the tournament against
Brazil<00:06:32.289> but<00:06:33.060> still<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.330> approach<00:06:34.720> in<00:06:34.990> this

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
Brazil but still the approach in this

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.080 
Brazil but still the approach in this
match<00:06:35.440> II<00:06:35.470> was<00:06:35.800> just<00:06:36.099> not<00:06:36.310> right<00:06:36.580> I<00:06:36.639> think<00:06:36.970> you

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
match II was just not right I think you

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.370 
match II was just not right I think you
know<00:06:37.180> there's<00:06:37.419> a<00:06:37.479> couple<00:06:37.599> players<00:06:37.930> there<00:06:38.199> that

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
know there's a couple players there that

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.680 
know there's a couple players there that
just<00:06:38.560> wanted<00:06:39.130> to<00:06:39.220> kick<00:06:39.400> the<00:06:39.520> lawn<00:06:39.639> I<00:06:40.389> mean<00:06:40.569> it

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
just wanted to kick the lawn I mean it

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.360 
just wanted to kick the lawn I mean it
was<00:06:40.780> it<00:06:40.990> was<00:06:41.050> correctly<00:06:41.560> said<00:06:41.860> that<00:06:42.039> total

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
was it was correctly said that total

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.219 
was it was correctly said that total
football<00:06:42.699> was<00:06:42.849> no<00:06:43.000> more<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:43.479> they<00:06:43.780> proved<00:06:44.080> it

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
football was no more and they proved it

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.409 
football was no more and they proved it
today<00:06:44.380> yeah<00:06:45.069> sometimes<00:06:45.729> you<00:06:45.849> have<00:06:45.970> to<00:06:46.090> do<00:06:46.300> what

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
today yeah sometimes you have to do what

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.029 
today yeah sometimes you have to do what
you<00:06:46.479> have<00:06:46.569> to<00:06:46.630> do<00:06:46.840> to<00:06:47.020> win<00:06:47.139> a<00:06:47.199> game<00:06:47.470> and

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
you have to do to win a game and

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.529 
you have to do to win a game and
certainly<00:06:48.460> they<00:06:48.639> knew<00:06:48.819> they<00:06:48.970> had<00:06:49.090> to<00:06:49.120> be<00:06:49.240> tight

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
certainly they knew they had to be tight

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.540 
certainly they knew they had to be tight
and<00:06:49.690> they<00:06:49.780> had<00:06:49.870> to<00:06:49.990> defend<00:06:50.139> well<00:06:50.560> and<00:06:50.800> upset

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
and they had to defend well and upset

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.670 
and they had to defend well and upset
the<00:06:51.639> Spanish<00:06:52.030> but<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:52.750> tactics<00:06:53.169> they<00:06:53.319> used<00:06:53.500> to

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
the Spanish but the tactics they used to

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.740 
the Spanish but the tactics they used to
do<00:06:53.830> it<00:06:53.979> I<00:06:54.400> mean<00:06:55.030> they<00:06:55.150> were<00:06:55.240> lucky<00:06:55.419> that<00:06:55.539> they

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
do it I mean they were lucky that they

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.149 
do it I mean they were lucky that they
didn't<00:06:55.930> know<00:06:55.990> more<00:06:56.139> than<00:06:56.289> just<00:06:56.349> how<00:06:56.889> to<00:06:56.949> get

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159
