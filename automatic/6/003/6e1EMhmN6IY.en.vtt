this<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.389> hypnotist<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.640> I<00:00:05.640> will<00:00:05.970> be

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
this is the hypnotist and I will be

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.890 
this is the hypnotist and I will be
demonstrating<00:00:07.849> the<00:00:08.849> advanced<00:00:09.240> technique

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
demonstrating the advanced technique

demonstrating the advanced technique
dubbed<00:00:10.410> as<00:00:10.769> waves<00:00:11.580> crashing<00:00:12.950> also<00:00:13.950> known<00:00:14.190> as

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
dubbed as waves crashing also known as

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.890 
dubbed as waves crashing also known as
snake<00:00:15.420> sliding<00:00:16.789> whatever<00:00:17.789> doesn't<00:00:18.750> really

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
snake sliding whatever doesn't really

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.590 
snake sliding whatever doesn't really
matter<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:22.279> I'm<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.939> get<00:00:24.060> into<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
matter so I'm just going to get into it

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.320 
matter so I'm just going to get into it
and<00:00:25.580> potentially<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:26.849> what<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> looks

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and potentially that's what it looks

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:37.930 
and potentially that's what it looks
like<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:31.040> what<00:00:32.040> you're<00:00:33.110> doing<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:37.110> you're

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
like and what you're doing is you're

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
like and what you're doing is you're
dashing<00:00:39.440> but<00:00:40.440> right<00:00:40.800> right<00:00:42.350> after<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.100> dash

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
dashing but right right after the dash

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420 
dashing but right right after the dash
immediately<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:46.260> hit<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> c-stick<00:00:47.010> forward

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
immediately you hit the c-stick forward

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
immediately you hit the c-stick forward
and<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.670> gamecube<00:00:48.090> controller<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.469> then

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and your gamecube controller and then

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
and your gamecube controller and then
you<00:00:49.800> press<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.390> trying<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> figure<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you press and we're trying to figure a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.900 
you press and we're trying to figure a
planet<00:00:54.860> basically<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.039> you're<00:00:56.190> doing<00:00:56.640> it's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
planet basically what you're doing it's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.540 
planet basically what you're doing it's
a<00:00:57.030> full<00:00:57.239> mouth<00:00:57.570> motion<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.620> wavedashing<00:00:59.219> low

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
a full mouth motion like wavedashing low

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.730 
a full mouth motion like wavedashing low
and<00:01:01.039> in<00:01:02.899> melee<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.320> melee

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and in melee so like in melee

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.450 
and in melee so like in melee
wavedashing<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.340> an

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
wavedashing with like but this is an

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.719 
wavedashing with like but this is an
efficient<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:16.490> can't<00:01:17.490> show<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
efficient at all I can't show the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
efficient at all I can't show the
controller<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.299> basically<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:19.409> you're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
controller for basically what you're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
controller for basically what you're
doing<00:01:20.000> if<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.060> touching<00:01:21.570> forward<00:01:22.229> see

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
doing if you're touching forward see

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.870 
doing if you're touching forward see
stick<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.810> then<00:01:25.100> Apogee<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.460> pretty<00:01:26.759> much

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
stick and then Apogee that's pretty much

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.010 
stick and then Apogee that's pretty much
it<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.220> efficient<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.020> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it and it's very efficient because it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.230 
it and it's very efficient because it's
a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.259> faster<00:01:31.470> than<00:01:31.829> running<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.759> running

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
a lot faster than running that's running

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.600 
a lot faster than running that's running
there<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.009> were<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.400> waste

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
there and then if I were to just waste

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.710 
there and then if I were to just waste
less<00:01:36.439> not<00:01:37.439> trick<00:01:37.909> what<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.509> would<00:01:39.600> be

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
less not trick what do that it would be

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.800 
less not trick what do that it would be
like<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.890> fast<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.240> follow<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
like that and how fast you can follow it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
like that and how fast you can follow it
it's<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.560> spacing<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:46.880> snake

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it's really good for spacing and snake

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
it's really good for spacing and snake
is<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> only<00:01:48.479> care<00:01:48.899> could<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.710> in

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
is not the only care could do this in

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.149 
is not the only care could do this in
fact<00:01:50.670> most<00:01:50.939> characters<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.740> it's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
fact most characters can do it but it's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.480 
fact most characters can do it but it's
only<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.570> beneficial<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.470> few<00:01:55.799> including

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
only very beneficial to a few including

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.380 
only very beneficial to a few including
wario<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.060> sheet<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> exact<00:02:00.119> same

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
wario and sheet it's not the exact same

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.970 
wario and sheet it's not the exact same
timing<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.680> wavedashing<00:02:02.130> lebanon

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
timing just like wavedashing lebanon

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.470 
timing just like wavedashing lebanon
maelich<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:04.300> it's<00:02:05.050> possible<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.480> personally

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
maelich but it's possible I personally

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.020 
maelich but it's possible I personally
think<00:02:07.900> it's<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.440> easiest<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.280> do<00:02:09.490> with<00:02:09.730> snake

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
think it's the easiest to do with snake

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.890 
think it's the easiest to do with snake
but<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:11.410> biased<00:02:12.360> dish<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.510> know<00:02:13.630> that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
but and this biased dish you know that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.170 
but and this biased dish you know that
if<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.770> end<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.610> splashing<00:02:16.090> when

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
if you end up for it splashing when

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.310 
if you end up for it splashing when
you're<00:02:16.300> trying<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.570> do<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.930> does<00:02:17.050> mean<00:02:17.200> to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you're trying to do it it does mean to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.750 
you're trying to do it it does mean to
rush<00:02:17.530> into<00:02:17.710> little<00:02:17.980> bits<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.220> sometimes<00:02:18.580> that

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
rush into little bits of sometimes that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.870 
rush into little bits of sometimes that
will<00:02:18.910> happen<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.480> know<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> don't<00:02:21.670> rush

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
will happen you know so don't rush

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.550 
will happen you know so don't rush
because<00:02:22.630> then<00:02:22.840> you're<00:02:22.960> good<00:02:23.080> really<00:02:23.290> short

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
because then you're good really short

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.500 
because then you're good really short
ones<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.160> when<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.000> might<00:02:25.150> want<00:02:25.420> that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
ones like that when you might want that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.030 
ones like that when you might want that
you<00:02:26.320> can<00:02:26.470> also<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.540> dash<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.650> lot<00:02:29.830> you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
you can also if you dash it's a lot you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.190 
you can also if you dash it's a lot you
do<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.490> just<00:02:30.670> dash<00:02:30.970> into<00:02:31.330> an<00:02:31.570> opponent<00:02:32.080> and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
do if you just dash into an opponent and

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.640 
do if you just dash into an opponent and
you<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:32.890> press<00:02:33.370> up<00:02:33.610> during<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> dash<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.590> you

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you just press up during the dash so you

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.750 
you just press up during the dash so you
can<00:02:35.860> attack<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:37.050> wave<00:02:38.050> smash<00:02:38.500> which<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.520> very

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
can attack and wave smash which is very

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.380 
can attack and wave smash which is very
beneficial<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.950> know<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
beneficial and you know it you can you

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.820 
beneficial and you know it you can you
can<00:02:43.570> put<00:02:43.750> them<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.050> combos<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.830> you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
can put them in the combos and and you
