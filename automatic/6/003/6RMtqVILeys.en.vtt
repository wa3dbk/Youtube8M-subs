00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.710
 ah 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.920
 hello I'm arturo and today the cycle 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.900
 Well I'm arturo and I'm a computer 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.349
 two passions have always been the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.849
 horses and DIY I work all 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.619
 the day with computers and all day with 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.759
 computers so one day I said 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.050
 to keep an eye on the inside 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.330
 computer more thoroughly I'll see what 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.150
 I can do and then I decided to do something 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.590
 with what are the motherboards of the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.930
 motherboards are these that are like 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.280
 cities from above and well then the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.500
 I will explain a bit how I started 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 to do this and I have picked some plates 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 base as I tell you I 've made a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.989
 structure has advanced me a bit already 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.489
 JCE coming because I know that 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.460
 television, you always go a little 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.140
 fast 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.989
 I have done this that is what would be a 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.090
 screen for a lamp to make 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 this object then in the cid a couple of 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.879
 little things and look then one day and being in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.489
 a decoration shop I'm not going to 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.920
 say what 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.180
 with my girlfriend I said look at this is a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.070
 drainer for those for forks 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.750
 of the knives but I'm sure 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 something else happens and then I have 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 decided that it will be the basis of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 our lamp then how am I going to join 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.970
 these two pieces as this hits a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 little bit with zeal what I'm going to do in 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
 reality is to put some methacrylate that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.050
 I've bought them and that's going to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.180
 close now 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.460
 the screen of the lamp then you 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.460
 I will put another here to screw eh 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.530
 and nothing else I'm going to start doing the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 piece of furniture 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.650
 first what I'm going to do is put the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.650
 lamp 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.670
 the glue and these things I think that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.670
 you have to buy 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.320
 and the most expensive 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.769
 and now what I would need a little 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.050
 guys you lower the light a bit because 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.710
 the lamp gives very little light and is very 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.440
 very very pretty when the light off 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.070
 looks on camera yes no 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.070
 good 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.420
 and this is the lamp has the white light 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.520
 from above 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 white light is below as 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.290
 we can do a little light 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.440
 and well I want to dedicate this this work 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.140
 to nuri lubricate and this is going to be the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 gift of our anniversary when 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.770
 see the chapter you'll have it at home 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.220
 but hey, it has made me very excited 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.220
 do what
