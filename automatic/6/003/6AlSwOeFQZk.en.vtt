00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
so this is the 675 longtail this is the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.049 
so this is the 675 longtail this is the
most<00:00:06.630> focused<00:00:07.170> version<00:00:07.920> of<00:00:08.309> these<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.940> what

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
most focused version of these and what

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.009 
most focused version of these and what

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
plexiglass so that saves I think it's

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.340 
plexiglass so that saves I think it's
four<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:48.970> half<00:01:49.000> four<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> half<00:01:50.020> kilos

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.880 
four and a half four and a half kilos
I'm<00:01:50.710> doing<00:01:50.920> well<00:01:51.040> with<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.190> number<00:01:51.430> two<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.440> on

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
I'm doing well with a number two so on

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.070 
I'm doing well with a number two so on
the<00:01:54.100> front<00:01:54.190> suspension<00:01:54.640> it's<00:01:55.330> 20<00:01:55.690> millimeters

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
the front suspension it's 20 millimeters

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.969 
the front suspension it's 20 millimeters
lower<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:56.410> you've<00:01:56.530> got<00:01:56.649> more<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:56.860> an

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
lower so you've got more of an

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.400 
lower so you've got more of an

I'm<00:02:07.720> going<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.899> get<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:09.330> the

there which is the f1 knocked out

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.390 
there which is the f1 knocked out
perhaps<00:03:47.360> curiously<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:48.470> only<00:03:48.680> 34

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
perhaps curiously it's only 34

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.550 
perhaps curiously it's only 34
millimeters<00:03:49.760> longer<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:51.050> apparently

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
millimeters longer but apparently

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.470 
millimeters longer but apparently
they're<00:03:51.739> saying<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.250> long<00:03:52.550> tail<00:03:52.790> form

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
they're saying that the long tail form

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.610 
they're saying that the long tail form
was<00:03:53.629> actually<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.959> wasn't<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:54.349> about<00:03:54.500> the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
was actually it wasn't just about the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.280 
was actually it wasn't just about the
long<00:03:54.830> tail<00:03:55.069> it<00:03:55.250> was<00:03:55.340> all<00:03:55.459> about<00:03:55.989> improving<00:03:56.989> the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
long tail it was all about improving the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.290 
long tail it was all about improving the
technology<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.190> added<00:03:58.730> light<00:03:58.910> weight<00:03:59.120> and

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
technology and added light weight and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.990 
technology and added light weight and
stuff<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.680> what<00:04:00.830> they've<00:04:00.980> done<00:04:01.849> in

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
stuff so this is what they've done in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.290 
stuff so this is what they've done in
this<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:03.019> there<00:04:03.200> we<00:04:03.319> go<00:04:03.349> inside<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.670> can<00:04:04.819> get<00:04:05.000> a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
this so there we go inside you can get a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.640 
this so there we go inside you can get a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
apparently it sounds very different it's

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.729 
apparently it sounds very different it's
just<00:04:16.479> 205<00:04:17.479> miles<00:04:17.720> an<00:04:17.840> hour<00:04:17.989> top<00:04:18.229> speed<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:21.109> you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.360 
over will wait and say 400 kilos lighter
so<00:04:25.750> apparently<00:04:26.750> it's<00:04:27.050> amazing<00:04:27.830> -<00:04:27.979> right<00:04:28.160> it's

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
so apparently it's amazing - right it's

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.200 
so apparently it's amazing - right it's
really<00:04:28.610> really<00:04:29.090> different<00:04:29.960> -<00:04:30.500> 650<00:04:31.220> s<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.850> we're

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
really really different - 650 s so we're

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.250 
really really different - 650 s so we're
certainly<00:04:32.479> looking<00:04:32.540> forward<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.080> could

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
certainly looking forward to it could

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.840 
certainly looking forward to it could
this<00:04:33.380> be<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.590> car<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.130> finally<00:04:34.580> sort<00:04:34.820> of

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
this be the car that finally sort of

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.070 
this be the car that finally sort of
takes<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.220> 12c<00:04:37.220> closer<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:37.880> frozen<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:38.900> we<00:04:38.990> now

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
takes the 12c closer to frozen so we now

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.550 
takes the 12c closer to frozen so we now
got<00:04:39.260> 488<00:04:39.860> GTB<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.900> sort<00:04:42.169> of<00:04:42.200> turbocharged<00:04:43.300> so

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
got 488 GTB that sort of turbocharged so

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960 
got 488 GTB that sort of turbocharged so
yeah<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> same<00:04:45.889> exactly<00:04:46.340> same<00:04:46.430> top<00:04:46.729> speeds
