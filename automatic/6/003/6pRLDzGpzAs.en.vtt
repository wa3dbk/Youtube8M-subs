hold small vibration and there we go we

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.180 
hold small vibration and there we go we
are<00:03:36.569> on<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.379> can<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.799> lighting<00:03:38.099> up

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.860 
actually set it so it shines up in all
sorts<00:03:43.949> of<00:03:43.979> different<00:03:44.159> colors<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.239> there<00:03:45.750> we

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
sorts of different colors and there we

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.300 
sorts of different colors and there we
go<00:03:46.019> hopefully<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.530> doing<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.769> justice<00:03:47.099> hope

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
go hopefully it's doing it justice hope

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.750 
go hopefully it's doing it justice hope
you<00:03:47.430> can<00:03:47.579> pick<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.790> up<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> video<00:03:48.419> now

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.159 

the<00:03:53.760> process<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.510> as<00:03:54.599> we<00:03:54.720> said<00:03:54.900> force

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
the process on this one as we said force

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.679 
the process on this one as we said force
1<00:03:55.409> gigahertz<00:03:55.709> with<00:03:56.189> a<00:03:56.220> nice<00:03:56.489> healthy<00:03:56.819> 512

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
megahertz with 384 megabytes of RAM so

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.210 
megahertz with 384 megabytes of RAM so
this<00:04:03.150> one<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.389> quicker<00:04:03.720> than<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.169> last<00:04:04.949> one

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
this one is quicker than the last one

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.339 
this one is quicker than the last one
very<00:04:07.099> retro<00:04:08.150> startup<00:04:09.150> screen<00:04:09.900> relics<00:04:10.199> of

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
very retro startup screen relics of

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:22.080 
very retro startup screen relics of
things<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:11.220> let's<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:11.549> skip<00:04:11.669> through<00:04:12.150> that

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.430 

so<00:04:22.690> they<00:04:22.810> know<00:04:22.900> if<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.080> can<00:04:23.200> tell<00:04:23.320> on<00:04:23.410> the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
so they know if you can tell on the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.140 
so they know if you can tell on the
camera<00:04:23.740> but<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:23.980> resolution<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.580> pretty<00:04:24.880> low

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
camera but the resolution is pretty low

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.390 
camera but the resolution is pretty low
it's<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.810> 3.2<00:04:26.560> inch<00:04:26.710> screen<00:04:27.040> with<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> resolution

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it's a 3.2 inch screen with a resolution

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.520 
it's a 3.2 inch screen with a resolution
of<00:04:27.820> 240<00:04:28.030> by<00:04:28.419> 320<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.860> PPI<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.430> very<00:04:30.790> low

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
of 240 by 320 so the PPI is a very low

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.780 
of 240 by 320 so the PPI is a very low
125<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:35.380> that's<00:04:35.530> actually<00:04:35.800> exactly<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.580> same

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
125 and that's actually exactly the same

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.490 
125 and that's actually exactly the same
as<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.090> last<00:04:37.270> one<00:04:37.510> as<00:04:37.600> well<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.020> screen<00:04:38.290> has

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
as the last one as well the screen has

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.990 
as the last one as well the screen has
changed<00:04:38.530> slightly<00:04:39.160> though<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.610> old<00:04:39.730> one<00:04:39.850> was

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
changed slightly though the old one was

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.310 
changed slightly though the old one was
just<00:04:40.270> TFT<00:04:40.810> screen

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
just TFT screen

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.370 
just TFT screen
this<00:04:41.650> one<00:04:41.860> isn't<00:04:42.130> IPS<00:04:42.820> LCD<00:04:43.270> display<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.200> it's

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
this one isn't IPS LCD display so it's

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.320 
this one isn't IPS LCD display so it's
much<00:04:44.620> better<00:04:44.860> different<00:04:45.669> viewing<00:04:45.910> angles

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
much better different viewing angles

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.360 
much better different viewing angles
then<00:04:47.200> if<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.410> can<00:04:47.500> pick<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.770> up<00:04:47.830> or<00:04:48.040> not<00:04:48.160> but

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
then if you can pick that up or not but

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.340 
then if you can pick that up or not but
it's<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.880> little<00:04:49.090> bit<00:04:49.240> better<00:04:49.750> than<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.200> old

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
it's a little bit better than the old

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.640 
it's a little bit better than the old
one<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.690> one<00:04:52.690> thing<00:04:52.840> that<00:04:52.900> I<00:04:53.020> like<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.200> do<00:04:53.410> is<00:04:53.560> to

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
one so one thing that I like to do is to

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.870 
one so one thing that I like to do is to
check<00:04:53.740> out<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:53.950> wallpapers<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:54.550> press<00:04:54.760> and

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
check out the wallpapers so press and

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
check out the wallpapers so press and
hold<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.740> wallpaper<00:04:57.340> gallery<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.720> get

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
hold and wallpaper gallery so you get

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.710 
hold and wallpaper gallery so you get
some<00:05:02.260> I<00:05:02.500> like<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.310> one<00:05:06.389> quite<00:05:07.389> a<00:05:07.419> few

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
some I like that one quite a few

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.500 
some I like that one quite a few
different<00:05:08.590> ones<00:05:08.940> straight<00:05:09.940> out<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.270> box

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
different ones straight out the box

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.020 
different ones straight out the box
which<00:05:10.930> are<00:05:11.050> quite<00:05:11.200> liked<00:05:11.470> but<00:05:12.430> let's<00:05:12.700> get<00:05:12.850> for

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
which are quite liked but let's get for

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.440 
which are quite liked but let's get for
that<00:05:13.180> one<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.680> there<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.340> go<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:16.120> can<00:05:16.180> see<00:05:16.360> the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
that one and there we go you can see the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.150 
that one and there we go you can see the
resolution<00:05:16.570> isn't<00:05:17.139> actually<00:05:17.380> too<00:05:17.560> bad<00:05:17.830> but<00:05:18.070> in

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
resolution isn't actually too bad but in

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.260 
resolution isn't actually too bad but in
terms<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.520> comparing<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.150> other

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
terms of comparing it to other

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.270 
terms of comparing it to other
smartphones<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.350> is<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.620> little<00:05:20.919> bit<00:05:21.100> on<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
smartphones it is a little bit on the

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.159 
smartphones it is a little bit on the
low<00:05:21.430> side<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.270> let's<00:05:22.389> pop<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.690> down<00:05:22.720> just

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
low side so let's pop that down just

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.650 
low side so let's pop that down just
scroll<00:05:24.010> across<00:05:24.100> yes<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.700> does<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:24.940> few<00:05:25.479> more

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
scroll across yes it does a few more

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.810 
scroll across yes it does a few more
there<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:28.410> there<00:05:29.410> we<00:05:29.530> go<00:05:29.710> let's<00:05:30.580> see<00:05:30.729> if

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
there and there we go let's see if
