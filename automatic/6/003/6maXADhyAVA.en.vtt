work as an illustrator painter and live
artist<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:47.470> think<00:00:48.470> it<00:00:48.620> would<00:00:48.710> be<00:00:48.830> hard<00:00:49.070> to

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
artist I think it would be hard to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.820 
artist I think it would be hard to
describe<00:00:49.670> my<00:00:50.180> style<00:00:50.240> in<00:00:50.720> one<00:00:50.960> way<00:00:51.170> because<00:00:51.560> I

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
describe my style in one way because I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.550 
describe my style in one way because I
try<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.100> change<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.030> adapt<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.360> each<00:00:53.930> brief

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
try and change and adapt to each brief

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:05.899 
try and change and adapt to each brief
or<00:00:54.920> format<00:00:55.490> or<00:00:55.700> audience

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.899 

the<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> define<00:01:07.229> my<00:01:07.860> favorite<00:01:08.280> projects

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the way I define my favorite projects

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.630 
the way I define my favorite projects
would<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.509> not<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.100> much<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> final

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
would be not just so much the final

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
would be not just so much the final
outcome<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.689> lot<00:01:12.930> about<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.289> process<00:01:13.770> I'm

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
outcome but a lot about the process I'm

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.800 
outcome but a lot about the process I'm
always<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> looking<00:01:15.149> at<00:01:15.270> new<00:01:15.420> ways<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
always kind of looking at new ways of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560 
always kind of looking at new ways of
working<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.610> looking<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.850> new<00:01:18.180> ways<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
working and looking at new ways of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.279 
working and looking at new ways of
expressing<00:01:19.640> my<00:01:20.640> creativity<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.659> there's

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
expressing my creativity so there's

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.870 
expressing my creativity so there's
always<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.829> new<00:01:23.130> challenge<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.850> think

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
always a new challenge and I think

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.410 
always a new challenge and I think
that's<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> most<00:01:24.570> motivating<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.500> me

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.260 

I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:40.380> I've<00:01:40.470> been<00:01:40.650> quite<00:01:40.890> fond<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.030> being

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I think I've been quite fond of being

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.780 
I think I've been quite fond of being
quite<00:01:42.540> purist<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> comes<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.979> working

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
quite purist when it comes to working

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
quite purist when it comes to working
and<00:01:44.939> I've<00:01:45.060> had<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> real<00:01:45.509> separation<00:01:45.750> between

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
and I've had a real separation between

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
and I've had a real separation between
what's<00:01:46.590> analog<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.060> what's<00:01:48.210> traditional

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
what's analog was and what's traditional

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.100 
what's analog was and what's traditional
-<00:01:48.990> what's<00:01:49.200> digital<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.190> complete<00:01:51.110> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
- what's digital and and complete it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
- what's digital and and complete it
allows<00:01:52.560> me<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.280> chances<00:01:53.940> but<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
allows me to take more chances but it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
allows me to take more chances but it
also<00:01:54.990> allows<00:01:55.500> me<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:56.039> more<00:01:56.250> experimental

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
also allows me to be more experimental

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.779 
also allows me to be more experimental
because<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> element<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> risk<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.770> gone

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.740 

the<00:02:07.789> main<00:02:08.119> way<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.289> work<00:02:09.649> would<00:02:10.489> be<00:02:10.879> if<00:02:11.510> I'm

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the main way that I work would be if I'm

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.100 
the main way that I work would be if I'm
looking<00:02:11.900> at<00:02:12.250> figure<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.459> I'll<00:02:13.940> choose<00:02:14.330> whether

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
looking at figure so I'll choose whether

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.210 
looking at figure so I'll choose whether
I<00:02:15.230> use<00:02:16.420> photobooth<00:02:17.420> sometimes<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.709> I'll

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
I use photobooth sometimes and I'll

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.940 
I use photobooth sometimes and I'll
recreate<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:20.090> position<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:20.870> oppose<00:02:21.349> that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
recreate a position and oppose that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
recreate a position and oppose that
helps<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:24.250> dialogue<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.489> narrative<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.299> will

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
helps a dialogue or a narrative I will

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
helps a dialogue or a narrative I will
work<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:28.040> predominantly<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.000> figure<00:02:29.299> first

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
work with predominantly the figure first

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.020 
work with predominantly the figure first
because<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:29.989> want<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.709> be<00:02:30.739> that's<00:02:31.640> where

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
because I want that to be that's where

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.360 
because I want that to be that's where
it<00:02:32.750> connects<00:02:33.110> with<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.319> viewer<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.739> think<00:02:34.099> so

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it connects with the viewer I think so

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.160 
it connects with the viewer I think so
the<00:02:34.459> gaze<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> eyes<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.959> expression

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the gaze and the eyes and the expression

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.850 
the gaze and the eyes and the expression
and<00:02:36.829> then<00:02:37.790> everything<00:02:38.569> else<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:39.379> be<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and then everything else would be the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.000 
and then everything else would be the
sort<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.190> supporting<00:02:40.760> characters<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.810> way

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
sort of supporting characters in a way

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.490 
sort of supporting characters in a way
so<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.670> piece<00:02:43.910> will<00:02:44.329> be<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:44.780> refined<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
so that piece will be really refined and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.220 
so that piece will be really refined and
completed<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.579> then<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.269> will<00:02:47.540> scan<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.049> in

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
completed and then I will scan that in

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.740 
completed and then I will scan that in
maybe<00:02:49.069> print<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.549> out<00:02:49.730> we'll<00:02:50.030> work<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.390> chasing

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
maybe print it out we'll work on chasing

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.630 
maybe print it out we'll work on chasing
paper<00:02:50.959> as<00:02:51.260> an<00:02:51.440> overlay<00:02:51.799> on<00:02:51.829> top<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.519> I'll

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
paper as an overlay on top and I'll

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.130 
paper as an overlay on top and I'll
start<00:02:52.910> working<00:02:53.090> with<00:02:53.569> with<00:02:54.349> maybe<00:02:54.980> text<00:02:55.700> or

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
start working with with maybe text or

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.050 
start working with with maybe text or
other<00:02:57.140> element<00:02:57.680> whether<00:02:57.980> then<00:02:58.250> natural

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
other element whether then natural

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.940 
other element whether then natural
wildlife<00:03:00.280> things<00:03:01.280> like<00:03:01.459> that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.520 

through<00:03:07.640> using<00:03:07.880> digital<00:03:08.209> textures<00:03:09.080> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
through using digital textures and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.339 
through using digital textures and
creating<00:03:10.130> brushes<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.819> could<00:03:11.599> create

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
creating brushes I could create

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.260 
creating brushes I could create
something<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:13.069> maybe<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.670> sort<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.090> vintage

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
something that maybe a sort of vintage

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.780 
something that maybe a sort of vintage
