00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.840
 Someone who competes for this tournament leader fight has ever lived 63 kg 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.920

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.629
 This year is wild rush 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:53.510
 It will be converted to the 67 kg class from this time I got an active league match 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:57.409
 And Jun Nakazawa players is the first race this time from the Martial Arts Japan Kickboxing Federation 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.089
 You think from in that both players would like to hit the enthusiasm 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.089
 First Nakata thank you from sperm 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.930
 Well 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.540

 I think I want to play a memorable game 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.840
 Then someone request player 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.930
 a I will try to me to me these days of Kirogu 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:32.410
 The fact is that the first match is not for three consecutive years early 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.300
 It's a bit sweaty, but it's hard for me 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:42.850
 I feel very much indebted to the crash when I do it once every morning 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.590
 You 've just been crashing the game for the past three years, not just the New Year's three years 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.829
 I will not lie to the crash 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.340
 I'm going to play a game that is sure to live in order to live 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.340
 Do you think 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.580
 Masu Tei 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.690
 There was also English 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.780
 Well, I originally originally reviewed it and I made a debut at 70 km 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.080
 8 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.300
 I heard there was a crash 63 ball and there was a part that was forced to drop 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:33.320
 Each time the raw material has become a number more than 10 kg lighter than an honest challenge 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.320
 Originally I feel like going back to a place where my power is easy 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.140
 So I need your help because you will find your question 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.670
 Well, maybe I can't play a pretty beautiful game 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.510
 I can throw a lot 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.470
 Even if it is beaten well, it looks like it 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.610
