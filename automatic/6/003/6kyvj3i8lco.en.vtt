00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
just like crazy is it somewhere in

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.710 
just like crazy is it somewhere in
between<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:49.100> guess<00:04:49.789> it's<00:04:49.970> all<00:04:50.090> depending<00:04:50.600> on

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
between I guess it's all depending on

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.710 
between I guess it's all depending on
which<00:04:50.960> bike<00:04:51.740> yeah<00:04:51.979> which<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.340> long<00:04:52.490> time<00:04:52.789> okay

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
which bike yeah which a long time okay

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.420 
which bike yeah which a long time okay
so<00:04:54.199> somewhere<00:04:54.500> between<00:04:54.560> five<00:04:55.039> hundred

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
so somewhere between five hundred

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.980 
so somewhere between five hundred
dollars<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:55.970> ten<00:04:56.120> thousand<00:04:56.479> dollars<00:04:56.720> you<00:04:56.930> can

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
dollars and ten thousand dollars you can

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.409 
dollars and ten thousand dollars you can
get<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.260> bicycle<00:04:57.770> yeah<00:04:58.490> close<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:58.970> closer<00:04:59.240> to

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
get a bicycle yeah close it closer to

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.000 
get a bicycle yeah close it closer to
the<00:04:59.600> middle<00:04:59.750> submit<00:05:00.440> look<00:05:00.650> there<00:05:00.830> yeah
