transformation usually I don't see off
the<00:01:42.740> tail<00:01:42.890> for<00:01:43.040> transformation<00:01:43.610> but<00:01:43.730> I'm

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
the tail for transformation but I'm

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.790 
the tail for transformation but I'm
gonna<00:01:44.030> because<00:01:44.390> recording<00:01:44.990> makes<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.650> little

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
gonna because recording makes a little

gonna because recording makes a little
top<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.310> it'll<00:01:46.460> get<00:01:46.580> in<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.730> way<00:01:49.300> first

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
top and it'll get in the way first

I start by unlocking his hips they kind
of<00:01:53.900> just<00:01:54.140> unpack<00:01:54.620> from<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.750> back<00:01:56.990> there

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
and then they start they come free this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.930 
and then they start they come free this
back<00:01:59.840> portion<00:02:00.170> here<00:02:00.530> will<00:02:00.710> unhooked<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:02.420> so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
back portion here will unhooked like so

little white panels rotate those around
it's<00:04:04.500> easier<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.800> do<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.980> when<00:04:05.070> they're<00:04:05.190> kind

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
it's easier to do it when they're kind

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460 
it's easier to do it when they're kind
of<00:04:05.400> down<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.790> far

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470

they did that if you even look at those

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.680 
they did that if you even look at those
they're<00:04:18.360> asymmetrical<00:04:18.900> also<00:04:20.390> push<00:04:21.390> them<00:04:21.540> back

they will lock into a little peg ports
in<00:04:29.790> there<00:04:30.770> click<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:34.260> hands<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.830> usually<00:04:35.070> just

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
in there click the hands I usually just

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.390 
in there click the hands I usually just
rotate<00:04:35.700> them<00:04:35.850> around<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:37.250> straighten<00:04:38.250> this

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
rotate them around I straighten this

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.160 
rotate them around I straighten this
portion<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.060> then<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.420> pulled<00:04:39.690> these<00:04:39.840> claws

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
portion and then I pulled these claws

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.340 
portion and then I pulled these claws
forward<00:04:40.790> it's<00:04:41.790> pretty<00:04:42.090> much<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.450> for<00:04:42.750> his<00:04:42.870> arms

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
forward it's pretty much it for his arms

forward it's pretty much it for his arms
his<00:04:43.500> arms<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.340> reason<00:04:44.610> why<00:04:44.700> I

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
his arms this is the reason why I

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.460 
his arms this is the reason why I
initially<00:04:45.030> didn't<00:04:45.480> like<00:04:45.630> them<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.050> it's
