00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
out of metal than plastic this time

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
out of metal than plastic this time
around<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> cost<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.170> step<00:00:49.440> forward

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
seems it's now going to include a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
seems it's now going to include a
non-removable<00:00:54.510> battery<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.620> time

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
non-removable battery and this time

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
non-removable battery and this time
around<00:00:55.949> smaller<00:00:56.610> than<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> galaxy

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
around smaller than that of the galaxy

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
battery with them just a case the phone

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.080 
battery with them just a case the phone
dies<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.100> alternatives<00:01:20.909> as

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
dies but you do have alternatives as

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.969 
dies but you do have alternatives as
well<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.630> an<00:01:21.750> extended<00:01:22.200> battery<00:01:22.320> case<00:01:22.770> or

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
well like an extended battery case or

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
well like an extended battery case or
even<00:01:23.100> external<00:01:23.759> battery<00:01:24.090> packs<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.810> another

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
even external battery packs now another

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
even external battery packs now another
issue<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.640> 2600<00:01:26.640> milliamp<00:01:26.790> hour<00:01:27.180> battery

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
issue is that 2600 milliamp hour battery

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.020 
issue is that 2600 milliamp hour battery
that<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.140> still<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> rumor<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that is still a rumor but if that is so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.289 
that is still a rumor but if that is so
this<00:01:30.299> may<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.439> total<00:01:32.159> issue<00:01:32.400> since<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this may not be a total issue since the

this may not be a total issue since the
Snapdragon<00:01:34.020> 810<00:01:34.500> suppose<00:01:34.890> make<00:01:35.100> an

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
Snapdragon 810 suppose make an

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
Snapdragon 810 suppose make an
appearance<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> s6<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.990> supposedly<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
appearance on the s6 which supposedly is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
appearance on the s6 which supposedly is
going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.189> better<00:01:38.549> battery<00:01:39.150> consumption

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
going to have better battery consumption

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
going to have better battery consumption
but<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> same<00:01:40.680> time<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.159> don't<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.579> why

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but at the same time I don't see why

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
but at the same time I don't see why
Samsung<00:01:42.509> would<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.869> made<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> batteries

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
Samsung would have made the batteries

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.490 
Samsung would have made the batteries
smaller<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.149> course<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.630> decide<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.290> one

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
smaller then of course I decide with one

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
smaller then of course I decide with one
step<00:01:46.710> forward<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.369> two<00:01:47.579> steps<00:01:47.909> back

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180

the<00:01:48.960> battery<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> thinner<00:01:50.250> which

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the battery is going to be thinner which
