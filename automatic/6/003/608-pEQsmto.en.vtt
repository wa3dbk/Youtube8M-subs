00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
weeks down the line and then that's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.170 
weeks down the line and then that's
where<00:01:33.740> we<00:01:33.829> came<00:01:33.979> out<00:01:34.130> with<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.369> e<00:01:34.399> posey<00:01:34.820> no.2

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
where we came out with the e posey no.2

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.109 
where we came out with the e posey no.2
is<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.840> course<00:01:36.109> it<00:01:36.890> actually<00:01:37.460> does<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> little

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
is of course it actually does a little

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.969 
is of course it actually does a little
bit<00:01:38.240> more<00:01:38.420> than<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.659> nitrix<00:01:39.079> but<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:39.740> still

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
bit more than the nitrix but it still

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.620 
bit more than the nitrix but it still
shares<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.369> same<00:01:40.520> fundamentals<00:01:41.149> as<00:01:41.240> partial

from it now one thing I should notice
when<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.099> pick<00:02:19.340> up<00:02:19.489> these<00:02:19.640> posing<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.660> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
when I pick up these posing is that it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.720 
when I pick up these posing is that it
does<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.140> more<00:02:21.319> veiling<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.860> pretty<00:02:22.130> high

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
does have more veiling and pretty high

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.270 
does have more veiling and pretty high
up<00:02:22.760> here<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.330> ingredients<00:02:23.860> label<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.099> tell

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
up here on the ingredients label so tell

valine<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.920> Arjun<00:02:28.310> ace<00:02:28.400> inhibitor<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
valine is in Arjun ace inhibitor now it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.510 
valine is in Arjun ace inhibitor now it
sounds<00:02:29.870> me<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.200> BS<00:02:30.590> Evans<00:02:30.950> become<00:02:31.190> aware<00:02:31.400> of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
sounds me like BS Evans become aware of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.100 
sounds me like BS Evans become aware of
that<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> pencil<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.660> said<00:02:32.959> that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
that and the pencil but you said that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.089 
that and the pencil but you said that
would<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.319> part<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> reason<00:02:33.920> why<00:02:34.040> this

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
would be part of the reason why this

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.830 
would be part of the reason why this
product<00:02:34.459> came<00:02:34.670> out<00:02:34.849> is<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.300> right<00:02:35.599> well<00:02:35.810> I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
product came out is that right well I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.150 
product came out is that right well I
mean<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.200> that's<00:02:36.470> also<00:02:36.769> part<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> reason

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
mean that that's also part of the reason

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.640 
mean that that's also part of the reason
but<00:02:37.519> then<00:02:37.700> again<00:02:37.819> how<00:02:38.510> could<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.870> make<00:02:39.050> nitrix

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
but then again how could you make nitrix

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.199 
but then again how could you make nitrix
better<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.280> know<00:02:40.370> if<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.610> if<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.940> really

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
better you know if you if you really

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.030 
better you know if you if you really
look<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.720> track<00:02:41.930> history<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.380> nitric

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
look at the track history of nitric

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.500 
look at the track history of nitric
oxide<00:02:43.130> products<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.819> pretty<00:02:44.000> work<00:02:44.150> out<00:02:44.330> let's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
oxide products not pretty work out let's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.620 
oxide products not pretty work out let's
look<00:02:44.690> at<00:02:44.780> two<00:02:44.930> nights<00:02:45.140> ago<00:02:45.260> at<00:02:45.560> products

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
look at two nights ago at products

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.690 
who you had nitrogen at pump tech you
know<00:02:52.790> x2<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.390> x3<00:02:54.010> what's<00:02:55.010> really<00:02:55.280> left<00:02:55.489> now

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
know x2 and x3 what's really left now

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.720 
know x2 and x3 what's really left now
no.2<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.110> nitrix<00:02:57.920> which<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.370> very<00:02:58.549> good

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
no.2 and nitrix which is a very good

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.339 
no.2 and nitrix which is a very good
product<00:02:58.940> then<00:02:59.569> again<00:02:59.780> we<00:02:59.870> had<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> delivery

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
product then again we had a delivery

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.650 
product then again we had a delivery
system<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.980> kept<00:03:01.459> nitrix<00:03:01.910> alive<00:03:02.360> pretty

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
system that kept nitrix alive pretty

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.140 
system that kept nitrix alive pretty
much<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> last<00:03:03.110> seven<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.440> eight<00:03:03.620> years<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:05.120> I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
much the last seven to eight years so I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.610 
much the last seven to eight years so I
mean<00:03:05.360> we<00:03:05.540> actually<00:03:05.900> had<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.349> make<00:03:06.470> that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
mean we actually had and make that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.080 
mean we actually had and make that
product<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:06.980> are<00:03:07.190> having<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.549> do<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.880> well

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
product that are having to do that well

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.380 
product that are having to do that well
let's<00:03:08.750> look<00:03:08.989> at<00:03:09.140> people's<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:09.920> know<00:03:10.069> to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
let's look at people's you know to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.940 
let's look at people's you know to
basically<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.810> want<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.049> do<00:03:12.140> with<00:03:12.290> what<00:03:12.560> equal

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
basically we want to do with what equal

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.650 
basically we want to do with what equal
zine<00:03:13.099> is<00:03:13.310> obviously<00:03:13.819> put<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.209> delivery

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
zine is obviously put the delivery

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.300 
zine is obviously put the delivery
system<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.049> there<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.380> then<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.650> there's<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
system in there and then I there's the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.039 
system in there and then I there's the
arginine<00:03:16.760> compound<00:03:17.269> which<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
arginine compound which is the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.630 
arginine compound which is the
fundamentals<00:03:18.500> nitric<00:03:18.830> oxide<00:03:19.190> but<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:19.489> what

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
fundamentals nitric oxide but then what

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.539 
fundamentals nitric oxide but then what
we<00:03:19.760> did<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:19.940> edit<00:03:20.359> normally<00:03:20.799> programming<00:03:21.799> and

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
we did was edit normally programming and

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.640 
we did was edit normally programming and
then<00:03:22.640> also<00:03:22.910> we<00:03:23.239> actually<00:03:23.540> added<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.290> anabolic

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
then also we actually added the anabolic

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.500 
then also we actually added the anabolic
red<00:03:25.100> mass<00:03:25.310> matrix<00:03:25.760> which<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.269> set<00:03:26.450> of

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
red mass matrix which is the set of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.259 
red mass matrix which is the set of
botanicals<00:03:27.109> like<00:03:27.680> purple<00:03:28.040> coneflower<00:03:28.519> which

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
botanicals like purple coneflower which

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.180 
botanicals like purple coneflower which
in<00:03:29.570> turn<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.290> going<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.530> spike<00:03:30.739> your<00:03:30.769> III

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
in turn is going to spike your III

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.550 
in turn is going to spike your III
poetry<00:03:31.609> levels<00:03:31.940> now<00:03:32.060> what<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.239> means<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.750> the

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
poetry levels now what that means is the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.199 
poetry levels now what that means is the
red<00:03:33.739> blood<00:03:33.950> cell<00:03:34.190> count<00:03:34.220> within<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.030> blood

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
red blood cell count within the blood

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.059 
red blood cell count within the blood
stream<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.660> actually<00:03:35.840> gonna<00:03:36.109> be<00:03:36.170> boosted<00:03:36.799> a

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
stream is actually gonna be boosted a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.610 
stream is actually gonna be boosted a
lot<00:03:37.819> of<00:03:37.910> people<00:03:38.180> for<00:03:39.170> example

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
lot of people for example

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.910 
lot of people for example
endurance<00:03:40.250> athletes<00:03:40.989> boxers<00:03:41.989> they<00:03:42.560> go<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.739> Big

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
endurance athletes boxers they go to Big

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.289 
endurance athletes boxers they go to Big
Bear<00:03:43.069> California<00:03:43.100> or<00:03:43.850> they<00:03:43.940> go<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.090> high

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
Bear California or they go to high

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.000 
Bear California or they go to high
altitude<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:45.260> order<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.620> increase<00:03:45.769> in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
altitude in order to increase in

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.890 
altitude in order to increase in
endurance<00:03:46.190> why<00:03:46.579> because<00:03:46.910> training<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
endurance why because training in the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.629 
endurance why because training in the
thin<00:03:47.930> air<00:03:48.260> you're<00:03:48.470> gonna<00:03:48.560> actually<00:03:48.769> bump<00:03:49.519> up

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
thin air you're gonna actually bump up

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.640 
thin air you're gonna actually bump up
the<00:03:49.760> red<00:03:49.880> blood<00:03:50.090> cells<00:03:50.359> naturally<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.079> then

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
the red blood cells naturally and then

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.780 
the red blood cells naturally and then
you<00:03:51.859> guys<00:03:51.950> are<00:03:52.069> gonna<00:03:52.190> benefit<00:03:52.519> from<00:03:52.579> that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
you guys are gonna benefit from that

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.039 
you guys are gonna benefit from that
because<00:03:52.940> you'd<00:03:53.239> more<00:03:53.389> red<00:03:53.569> blood<00:03:53.600> cells<00:03:53.959> you

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
because you'd more red blood cells you

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.900 
because you'd more red blood cells you
have<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.290> your<00:03:54.350> body<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.250> more<00:03:55.430> oxygen

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
have in your body but the more oxygen

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.069 
have in your body but the more oxygen
and<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.120> more<00:03:56.269> nutrients<00:03:56.720> are<00:03:56.780> getting<00:03:56.989> to

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
and the more nutrients are getting to

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.050 
and the more nutrients are getting to
draw<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.350> BOTS<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:58.280> know<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.639> muscles<00:03:58.970> of

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
draw the BOTS you know to the muscles of

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.210 
draw the BOTS you know to the muscles of
the<00:03:59.090> rough<00:03:59.269> body<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.470> that's<00:04:00.590> what<00:04:00.829> basically

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
the rough body so that's what basically

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.979 
the rough body so that's what basically
what<00:04:01.340> we're<00:04:01.430> doing<00:04:01.459> here<00:04:01.700> purple<00:04:02.569> coneflower

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
what we're doing here purple coneflower

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.360 
what we're doing here purple coneflower
is<00:04:03.139> just<00:04:03.350> one<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.889> four<00:04:04.220> or<00:04:04.310> five

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
is just one of the four or five

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.680 
is just one of the four or five
ingredients<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.970> we<00:04:05.090> have<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.329> there<00:04:05.450> which

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
ingredients that we have in there which

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.420 
ingredients that we have in there which
spikes<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.380> red<00:04:06.530> blood<00:04:06.739> cell<00:04:06.950> count<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.370> in

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
spikes the red blood cell count and in

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.250 
spikes the red blood cell count and in
terms<00:04:07.670> not<00:04:07.970> just<00:04:08.299> your<00:04:08.450> endurance<00:04:08.840> but<00:04:09.019> think

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
terms not just your endurance but think

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.449 
terms not just your endurance but think
about<00:04:09.440> how<00:04:09.530> many<00:04:09.590> people<00:04:09.739> are<00:04:10.010> out<00:04:10.190> there<00:04:10.220> that

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
about how many people are out there that

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.699 
about how many people are out there that
are<00:04:10.579> trying<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.910> get<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.959> muscle<00:04:12.319> hardness

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
are trying to get the muscle hardness

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.470 
are trying to get the muscle hardness
without<00:04:13.100> going<00:04:13.790> through<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.120> prohormone

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
without going through the prohormone

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.080 
without going through the prohormone
side<00:04:14.840> now<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.410> for<00:04:15.709> hormones<00:04:16.100> are<00:04:16.220> bad<00:04:16.370> you

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
side now that for hormones are bad you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.000 
side now that for hormones are bad you
know<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.930> is<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.079> perfect<00:04:18.320> substitute<00:04:18.889> for

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
know this is a perfect substitute for

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.500 
know this is a perfect substitute for
those<00:04:19.100> people

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
those people

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.000 
those people
really<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.900> just<00:04:20.140> want<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.350> get<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> pumps<00:04:20.860> and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
really I just want to get the pumps and

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.250 
really I just want to get the pumps and
feeling<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:21.970> feeling<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.420> look<00:04:22.630> but<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:23.230> know

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
feeling the feeling to look but you know

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
that one but yeah pretty much it's all

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.590 
that one but yeah pretty much it's all
on<00:05:50.590> body<00:05:50.800> weight<00:05:51.180> depending<00:05:52.180> on<00:05:52.270> that<00:05:52.420> will

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
on body weight depending on that will

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.210 
on body weight depending on that will
depend<00:05:52.780> on<00:05:52.960> if<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.200> gotta<00:05:53.380> go<00:05:53.500> three<00:05:53.770> tablets

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
depend on if you gotta go three tablets

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.360 
depend on if you gotta go three tablets
three<00:05:54.910> times<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.180> day<00:05:55.210> or<00:05:55.420> four<00:05:55.750> tablets

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
three times a day or four tablets

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.220 
three times a day or four tablets
okay<00:05:57.370> so<00:05:57.880> these<00:05:58.210> aren't<00:05:58.420> decent<00:05:58.780> size<00:05:58.930> tablet

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
okay so these aren't decent size tablet

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.360 
okay so these aren't decent size tablet
so<00:05:59.440> if<00:05:59.500> you're<00:05:59.590> somebody<00:05:59.860> that's<00:05:59.980> gonna<00:06:00.190> have

so if you're somebody that's gonna have
trouble<00:06:00.700> with<00:06:00.790> tablets<00:06:01.240> this<00:06:01.360> probably<00:06:01.780> isn't

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
trouble with tablets this probably isn't

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.290

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
know yes some people break the tablets

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.390 
know yes some people break the tablets
but<00:06:11.020> when<00:06:11.200> that<00:06:11.380> happens<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:11.950> kind<00:06:12.160> of<00:06:12.190> kill

the delivery system on that you know

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.420 
the delivery system on that you know

seconds wants to you know convert us and
then<00:06:30.839> snuffed<00:06:31.529> out<00:06:31.739> yeah<00:06:31.860> anything<00:06:32.099> that's

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:32.369 
then snuffed out yeah anything that's

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.309 
then snuffed out yeah anything that's
affecting<00:06:32.909> here<00:06:33.209> your<00:06:33.419> body's<00:06:33.869> ability<00:06:34.019> to

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
affecting here your body's ability to

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.839 
affecting here your body's ability to
dilate<00:06:35.009> and<00:06:35.039> constrict<00:06:35.429> blood<00:06:35.699> vessels

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
dilate and constrict blood vessels

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.790 
dilate and constrict blood vessels
that's<00:06:36.809> that's<00:06:37.110> your<00:06:37.259> blood<00:06:37.409> pressure<00:06:37.649> so

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
that's that's your blood pressure so

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.320 
that's that's your blood pressure so
your<00:06:38.039> body's<00:06:38.309> going<00:06:38.580> to<00:06:38.729> have<00:06:38.879> a<00:06:38.909> check<00:06:39.209> and

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
your body's going to have a check and

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.609 
your body's going to have a check and

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:40.619 
balance system the control everybody

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:42.139 
balance system the control everybody
always<00:06:41.339> wants<00:06:41.459> to<00:06:41.699> maintain<00:06:41.879> that

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.149 
always wants to maintain that

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:43.939 
always wants to maintain that
homeostasis<00:06:42.629> so<00:06:42.869> you<00:06:43.469> know<00:06:43.559> you<00:06:43.679> can<00:06:43.800> only

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
homeostasis so you know you can only

trick<00:06:44.129> your<00:06:44.249> body<00:06:44.429> for<00:06:44.699> so<00:06:44.849> long<00:06:45.089> right<00:06:45.539> it's

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:47.249 
really what it comes out that's that's

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:48.559 
really what it comes out that's that's
why<00:06:47.519> it's<00:06:47.789> key<00:06:47.969> that<00:06:47.999> you<00:06:48.209> have<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.419> lose

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:48.569 
why it's key that you have to lose

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.899 
why it's key that you have to lose
someone<00:06:49.050> it's<00:06:49.589> still<00:06:49.830> one<00:06:49.979> six<00:06:50.279> seconds<00:06:50.699> but

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
someone it's still one six seconds but

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.600 
someone it's still one six seconds but
the<00:06:51.749> delivery<00:06:52.050> system<00:06:52.289> almost<00:06:52.499> keeps<00:06:53.339> it<00:06:53.490> as

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
the delivery system almost keeps it as

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.669 
the delivery system almost keeps it as
like<00:06:53.819> a<00:06:53.849> fountain<00:06:54.179> of<00:06:54.360> nl<00:06:54.719> just<00:06:55.229> constantly

impressive in the body or in the blood

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.040 
impressive in the body or in the blood
which<00:06:58.289> allows<00:06:58.919> that<00:06:58.949> basis<00:06:59.819> dilation<00:07:00.179> and<00:07:00.539> you

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
which allows that basis dilation and you
