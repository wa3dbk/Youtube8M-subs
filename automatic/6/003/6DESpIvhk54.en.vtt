00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.229 
say you have a straight edge this is a
little<00:02:10.649> bit<00:02:10.739> more<00:02:10.890> tricky<00:02:11.099> even<00:02:11.700> though<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
little bit more tricky even though it is

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.850 
little bit more tricky even though it is
a<00:02:12.270> straighter

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
a straighter

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.700 
a straighter
just<00:02:13.670> because<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:17.170> right<00:02:18.170> along<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.590> edge

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
just because it's right along the edge

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.110 
just because it's right along the edge
of<00:02:18.920> your<00:02:19.130> image<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.460> cut

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
of your image and so you can just cut

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.990 
of your image and so you can just cut
through<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.510> normal

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
through it as normal

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.260 
through it as normal
you<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.210> got<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.360> also<00:02:26.660> be<00:02:26.780> careful<00:02:27.110> with

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
you just got to also be careful with

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.440 
you just got to also be careful with
with<00:02:29.270> it's<00:02:29.840> sticking<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.530> stuff<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.010> whatever

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
with it's sticking to stuff and whatever

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.510 
with it's sticking to stuff and whatever
this<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.510> another<00:02:32.840> sticker<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.230> did<00:02:33.500> but<00:02:33.830> you

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
this is another sticker I did but you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.280 
this is another sticker I did but you
could<00:02:34.760> also<00:02:35.800> take<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.950> stickers<00:02:38.290> completely

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
could also take the stickers completely

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.900 
could also take the stickers completely
off<00:02:39.440> its<00:02:39.590> backing<00:02:39.800> like<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.250> did<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.790> put

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
off its backing like I just did and put

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.449 
off its backing like I just did and put
it<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> bigger<00:02:41.450> sticker<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.080> then<00:02:42.770> cut<00:02:43.070> down

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
it on a bigger sticker and then cut down

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.460 
it on a bigger sticker and then cut down
from<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.120> only<00:02:44.540> problem<00:02:44.930> with<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.230> is

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
from that the only problem with this is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.140 
from that the only problem with this is
that<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:48.340> different<00:02:49.340> type<00:02:50.120> of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
that if it is a different type of

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.410 
that if it is a different type of
backing<00:02:50.630> I<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.170> found<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.680> some<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.420> some

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
backing I have found that some are some

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.020 
backing I have found that some are some
of<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.810> stickers<00:02:54.140> don't<00:02:54.320> stay<00:02:55.160> as<00:02:55.489> well<00:02:55.790> on

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
of the stickers don't stay as well on

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420 
of the stickers don't stay as well on
this<00:02:56.330> type<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.570> backing<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.980> use<00:02:58.220> like

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
this type of backing so if you use like

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.370 
this type of backing so if you use like
the<00:02:58.580> same<00:02:58.820> backing<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.450> like<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.230> same

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
the same backing of like the same

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.490 
the same backing of like the same
sticker<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.890> used<00:03:01.190> that's<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.850> best<00:03:02.030> option

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
sticker you used that's the best option

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.040 
sticker you used that's the best option
so<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.970> one<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.360> little<00:03:05.540> bit<00:03:05.750> different

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
so this one is a little bit different

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.100 
so this one is a little bit different
but<00:03:06.170> from<00:03:06.770> here<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.840> cut<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.959> down

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
but from here you can just cut it down

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.440 
but from here you can just cut it down
like<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.620> even<00:03:11.680> get<00:03:12.680> as<00:03:13.550> close<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.239> want

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
like that even get as close as you want

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.770 
like that even get as close as you want
to<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.230> then<00:03:15.709> from<00:03:16.070> there<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.880> peel

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
to it and then from there you can peel

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.039 
to it and then from there you can peel
it<00:03:17.810> right<00:03:18.200> away<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:20.030> method<00:03:20.510> isn't<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.870> best

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
it right away this method isn't the best

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.530 
it right away this method isn't the best
I<00:03:21.380> would<00:03:21.709> most<00:03:21.950> suggest<00:03:22.700> this<00:03:23.150> method<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:25.540> you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
I would most suggest this method and you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.430 
I would most suggest this method and you
could<00:03:26.690> always<00:03:28.120> take<00:03:29.120> your<00:03:29.630> razor<00:03:29.870> blade<00:03:30.049> or

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
could always take your razor blade or

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.710 
could always take your razor blade or
whatever<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.040> go<00:03:31.640> on<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.000> back<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.450> sticker

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
whatever and go on the back of a sticker

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.170 
whatever and go on the back of a sticker
and<00:03:33.019> lightly<00:03:33.650> press<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.370> find<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.150> a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
and lightly press I find this is a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.030 
and lightly press I find this is a
really<00:03:35.570> risky<00:03:35.750> method<00:03:36.290> just<00:03:36.500> because<00:03:36.799> I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
really risky method just because I

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.160 
really risky method just because I
always<00:03:37.280> tend<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.760> go<00:03:37.910> through<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.750> sticker<00:03:39.049> on

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
always tend to go through the sticker on

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.900 
always tend to go through the sticker on
the<00:03:39.380> front<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.920> then<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.519> wasted

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the front and then it's just a wasted

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.930 
the front and then it's just a wasted
sticker<00:03:42.070> but<00:03:43.070> yeah<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.430> if<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:43.580> already<00:03:43.820> have

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
sticker but yeah so if you already have

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.080 
sticker but yeah so if you already have
a<00:03:44.090> pre-cut<00:03:44.570> sticker<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:46.310> easiest<00:03:46.820> way<00:03:47.060> I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
a pre-cut sticker the easiest way I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.479 
a pre-cut sticker the easiest way I
found<00:03:47.450> besides<00:03:47.930> putting<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.190> here<00:03:49.459> and

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
found besides putting it on here and

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.789 
found besides putting it on here and
risking<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.180> not<00:03:50.269> stay<00:03:50.690> although<00:03:51.620> this

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
risking that and not stay although this

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.650 
risking that and not stay although this
one<00:03:52.010> seems<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.430> pretty<00:03:52.640> holding<00:03:53.450> up<00:03:53.540> pretty

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
one seems to be pretty holding up pretty

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.800 
one seems to be pretty holding up pretty
well<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:54.739> just<00:03:54.890> risk<00:03:55.370> losing<00:03:55.940> some<00:03:56.330> adhesive

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
well you just risk losing some adhesive

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.039 
well you just risk losing some adhesive
nature<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.790> just<00:03:59.030> find<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.870> best

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
nature and so I just find the best

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.000 
nature and so I just find the best
method<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.739> peel<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.610> little<00:04:02.000> bit<00:04:02.269> of<00:04:02.390> it<00:04:02.570> so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
method is to peel a little bit of it so

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.340 
method is to peel a little bit of it so
you<00:04:04.010> have<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:05.090> then<00:04:05.209> take<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.780> little

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
you have that and then take a little

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.270 
you have that and then take a little
sliver<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:07.010> backing<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.170> one's<00:04:09.380> pretty

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
sliver of backing so this one's pretty

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.180 
sliver of backing so this one's pretty
good<00:04:10.519> make<00:04:11.510> sure<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.140> on<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.620> backing<00:04:12.799> side

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
good make sure it is on the backing side

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.289 
good make sure it is on the backing side
that<00:04:13.340> you're<00:04:13.459> putting<00:04:13.670> on<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.820> sticker<00:04:14.090> not

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
that you're putting on the sticker not

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.110 
that you're putting on the sticker not
the<00:04:14.630> other<00:04:14.870> face<00:04:15.170> because<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.680> could<00:04:16.120> make

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
the other face because it could make

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.640 
the other face because it could make
your<00:04:17.299> sticker<00:04:17.600> actually<00:04:17.959> stay<00:04:18.169> stuck<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.620> that

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
your sticker actually stay stuck to that

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.130 
your sticker actually stay stuck to that
and<00:04:18.979> then<00:04:19.579> just<00:04:19.790> put<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.329> in<00:04:20.450> between<00:04:20.600> the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
and then just put it in between the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.710 
and then just put it in between the
layer<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.890> sticker<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.460> then<00:04:22.910> snip<00:04:23.510> off<00:04:23.690> the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
layer of sticker and then snip off the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.110 
layer of sticker and then snip off the
end<00:04:24.050> whatever

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
end whatever

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.440 
end whatever
so<00:04:26.120> this

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
so this

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.160 
so this
way<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:28.040> have<00:04:28.160> backing<00:04:28.640> on<00:04:28.880> these<00:04:29.540> two<00:04:29.780> parts

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
way you have backing on these two parts

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.910 
way you have backing on these two parts
but<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:32.300> doesn't<00:04:32.990> affect<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.350> too<00:04:33.500> much<00:04:33.650> but

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
but that doesn't affect it too much but

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.780 
but that doesn't affect it too much but
you<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.340> then<00:04:34.670> have<00:04:35.570> easy<00:04:36.020> access<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.640> and

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
you can then have easy access to it and

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.540 
you can then have easy access to it and
it<00:04:38.240> has<00:04:38.270> some<00:04:38.450> hold<00:04:39.020> or<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.920> little<00:04:40.250> bit<00:04:40.340> hold

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
it has some hold or a little bit hold

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.570 
it has some hold or a little bit hold
just<00:04:40.730> because<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.150> has<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.510> been<00:04:41.570> removed<00:04:42.580> in

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
just because it has not been removed in

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.870 
just because it has not been removed in
comparison<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.990> rest<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:45.880> it'll

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
comparison to the rest of it so it'll

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.760 
comparison to the rest of it so it'll
give<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.210> pretty<00:04:47.480> good<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:48.380> at<00:04:48.590> least
