00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and I will spray over the seat just to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.560 
and I will spray over the seat just to
make<00:00:53.850> sure<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.690> penetrates<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.680> seat

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
make sure that it penetrates the seat

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.779 
make sure that it penetrates the seat
and<00:00:57.590> when<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:58.739> done<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.190> I'll<00:00:59.550> use

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and when I'm done with that I'll use

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.310 
and when I'm done with that I'll use
markers<00:01:00.359> I'll<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:01.109> black<00:01:01.379> marker<00:01:01.829> first

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.290 

and<00:01:08.409> then<00:01:09.310> I<00:01:09.580> will<00:01:09.700> use<00:01:10.860> blue<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:13.270> green

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
and then I will use blue and a green

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.550 
and then I will use blue and a green
marker<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.180> make<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.510> as<00:01:17.200> bad<00:01:17.530> as

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
marker just to make it as bad as

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.180 
marker just to make it as bad as
possible<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:19.390> as<00:01:19.630> many<00:01:19.840> stands<00:01:20.260> as<00:01:20.560> possible

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
possible with as many stands as possible

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.130 
possible with as many stands as possible
and<00:01:21.400> then<00:01:22.330> my<00:01:23.110> goal<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.460> clean<00:01:24.760> this<00:01:24.940> as<00:01:25.210> it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and then my goal is to clean this as it

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.920 
and then my goal is to clean this as it
nothing<00:01:26.950> ever<00:01:27.190> happened

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
nothing ever happened

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.770 
nothing ever happened
now<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:30.250> make<00:01:30.550> sure<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.330> use<00:01:31.540> this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
now just make sure that you use this

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.910 
now just make sure that you use this
stuff<00:01:33.840> only<00:01:34.840> when<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.200> needed<00:01:35.350> because<00:01:35.650> it's

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
stuff only when it's needed because it's

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.870 
stuff only when it's needed because it's
very<00:01:36.040> expensive<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:40.060> are<00:01:40.330> gonna<00:01:40.539> have<00:01:40.899> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
very expensive now you are gonna have to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.700 
very expensive now you are gonna have to
wait<00:01:43.440> at<00:01:44.440> least<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:45.310> would<00:01:46.000> say<00:01:46.350> three<00:01:47.350> minutes

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
wait at least I would say three minutes

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.930 
wait at least I would say three minutes
and<00:01:48.509> after<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.920> gotta<00:01:51.160> become<00:01:51.369> very

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
and after that it gotta become very

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.380 
and after that it gotta become very
foamy<00:01:52.300> so<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.350> are<00:01:53.920> scrub<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.520> phone<00:01:54.820> with

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
foamy so you are scrub the phone with

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.389 
foamy so you are scrub the phone with
this<00:01:55.600> brush<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:57.640> um<00:01:57.910> keep<00:01:58.720> on<00:01:58.869> scrubbing

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.950 
this brush and just um keep on scrubbing
the<00:02:00.399> stuff<00:02:00.700> penetrates<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:03.960> connects

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the stuff penetrates and it connects

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.729 
the stuff penetrates and it connects
somehow<00:02:05.500> with<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.070> pain<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.750> takes<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.560> on

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
somehow with the pain and it takes it on

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.199
