00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:09.959
Hey, it's Don with ProMaster Home Repair here.

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.620
Just a quick, impromptu video.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.250
I happened to walk back out in the shop and
one of my craftsmen was working on a window,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.439
and I said, "Hey Tim, What are you working
on?" and he said, "Well, I'm repairing some

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.410
wood rot around a window frame."

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.529
So I thought I'd make this quick video just
to show you this because this is critical.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.499
Folks think when their windows start to rot
out they've got to tear the window frame out,

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.399
they've got to buy all new windows for their
house, so they invite one of these sales people

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.110
from one of these major window companies,
and then they get pressured into buying all

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.110
new windows.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.110
NO!

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.110
A lot of times you can repair this stuff.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.110
So take a look at this.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.500
Some of the corners of this window frame were
rotted out, and if the glass is still good

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.160
and the rest of the window is still good,
you can rebuild these things at a fraction

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
of the cost.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.670
So why don't you take a look here and Tim
is going to explain what he did.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.450
I think we have a before picture too we can
put up for the folks just to see what it was

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.160
and just explain to all the home owners out
there so they can see how you fixed this.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.770
Well Don, what it was, is the bottom right
corner here was rotted out.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.090
That was this here right?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.090
Yes.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.100
And it was separated, and the window here
was actually falling out.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.670
The homeowner actually went ahead and took
this piece out himself and was trying to rebuild

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.619
it, and wasn't having much luck.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:32.530
So what we did is we went ahead and just bought
a small frame from the manufacturer and took

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.310
it apart and e were able to make our right
side here and our bottom piece here.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.050
Then we just put it back together and it was
a fraction of the cost.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.579
And we'll just prime it, paint it, and it'll
be as good as new.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.579
Yup.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.579
Fantastic!

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:47.579
