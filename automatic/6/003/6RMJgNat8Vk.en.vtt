00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.330 
the hospitals joint replacement Center
Kathy<00:02:04.930> already<00:02:05.230> had<00:02:05.380> her<00:02:05.590> right<00:02:05.800> side<00:02:05.830> done

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
Kathy already had her right side done

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.760 
Kathy already had her right side done
associate<00:02:07.150> she's<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.900> in<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.320> second

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.070 
associate she's going in for a second
side<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.190> Kathy<00:02:09.580> really<00:02:10.180> knows<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> lot<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.930> what

to expect already the traditional way of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.540 
to expect already the traditional way of
doing<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.870> total<00:02:14.140> hip<00:02:14.260> replacement<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.340> cut

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
doing a total hip replacement we cut

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.040 
doing a total hip replacement we cut
through<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.790> largest<00:02:16.270> muscles<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:16.840> body

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
we have to repair all those muscles

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.420 
we have to repair all those muscles
after<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.930> surgery<00:02:23.290> itself<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> recovery

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
after the surgery itself so the recovery

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.670 
after the surgery itself so the recovery
can<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.700> significantly<00:02:25.690> longer<00:02:26.020> due<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.500> the

can be significantly longer due to the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.200 
can be significantly longer due to the
repair<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.130> those<00:02:27.370> muscles<00:02:27.820> with<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
cuff is made of titanium so we get a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.040

her<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.700> little<00:03:59.940> bit<00:04:00.060> more<00:04:00.329> length<00:04:00.630> here<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.109> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
her a little bit more length here in the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.590 
her a little bit more length here in the
prosthesis<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.430> what<00:04:02.609> we<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.239> make<00:04:03.570> a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
prosthesis and so what we do is make a

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.330 
prosthesis and so what we do is make a
line<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.200> bottom<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.620> her<00:04:04.739> pelvis<00:04:05.160> which

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
line on the bottom of her pelvis which

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.729 
line on the bottom of her pelvis which
is<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> known<00:04:05.760> landmark<00:04:06.359> anatomic<00:04:07.170> site<00:04:07.440> and

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
is a known landmark anatomic site and

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.530 
is a known landmark anatomic site and
what<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.340> should<00:04:08.670> happen<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.299> line

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
what it should happen is this line

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.930 
what it should happen is this line
should<00:04:09.720> bisect<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.769> same<00:04:11.040> spot<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.730> bone

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
should bisect the same spot of this bone

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.509 
should bisect the same spot of this bone
on<00:04:12.239> each<00:04:12.480> side<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.109> that<00:04:13.170> will<00:04:13.650> tell<00:04:13.890> me<00:04:13.920> if

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
on each side and that will tell me if

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.759 
on each side and that will tell me if
this<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:15.000> exactly<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.810> same<00:04:16.019> which<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.590> on

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
this is exactly the same which it is on

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.500 
this is exactly the same which it is on
her<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.280> was<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.489> little<00:04:17.789> bit<00:04:17.940> higher<00:04:18.180> or

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
her if this was a little bit higher or

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.360 
her if this was a little bit higher or
if<00:04:18.539> this<00:04:18.780> hit<00:04:19.289> here<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:19.769> would<00:04:19.919> know<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.220> leg

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
if this hit here we would know the leg

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.009 
if this hit here we would know the leg
was<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.549> little<00:04:20.820> shorter<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.539> I'm<00:04:21.690> able<00:04:21.870> to

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
was a little shorter so I'm able to

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.560 
was a little shorter so I'm able to
adjust<00:04:22.530> my<00:04:22.970> components<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.240> time<00:04:24.419> of

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
adjust my components at the time of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.040 
adjust my components at the time of
surgery<00:04:24.810> based<00:04:25.289> on<00:04:25.470> that

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
surgery based on that

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.530

second hip done so close together

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.240 
second hip done so close together
because<00:06:18.539> it<00:06:18.659> wasn't<00:06:18.930> even<00:06:19.110> three<00:06:19.349> months<00:06:19.650> time

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
because it wasn't even three months time

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.430 
because it wasn't even three months time
and<00:06:21.340> because<00:06:21.910> I<00:06:21.940> work<00:06:22.240> full-time<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:22.960> in<00:06:23.320> a

and because I work full-time and in a
school<00:06:23.590> environment<00:06:23.860> I<00:06:24.370> needed<00:06:24.730> to<00:06:25.000> get<00:06:25.150> back

quicker<00:06:26.080> rather<00:06:26.320> than<00:06:26.620> later<00:06:26.830> so<00:06:27.130> this<00:06:27.670> has

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
quicker rather than later so this has

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.790 
quicker rather than later so this has
been<00:06:28.090> a<00:06:28.150> really<00:06:28.420> good<00:06:28.690> alternative<00:06:29.430> for<00:06:30.430> me
