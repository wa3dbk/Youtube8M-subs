miles<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:09.780> I'll<00:00:09.990> show<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.380> off<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.679> just<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
miles on it I'll show that off in just a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.390 
miles on it I'll show that off in just a
second<00:00:11.309> here<00:00:11.429> just<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:11.940> over<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> thousand

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
second here just a bit over a thousand

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.770 
second here just a bit over a thousand
it's<00:00:14.400> got<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> lot<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> mods<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.509> well<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
it's got a lot of mods on it as well and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.939 
it's got a lot of mods on it as well and
I<00:00:15.839> thought<00:00:15.960> I'd<00:00:16.080> take<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> few<00:00:16.350> minutes<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.800> show

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I thought I'd take a few minutes to show

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.660 
I thought I'd take a few minutes to show
those<00:00:17.160> off<00:00:18.109> first<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.740> biggest<00:00:19.949> improvement

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
those off first the biggest improvement

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.330 
those off first the biggest improvement
is<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> suspension<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.289> record<00:00:22.710> shocks<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is the suspension the record shocks that

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.740 
is the suspension the record shocks that
are<00:00:23.460> 12<00:00:23.640> minute<00:00:23.910> shocks<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> little

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
are 12 minute shocks so it's a little

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
are 12 minute shocks so it's a little
bit<00:00:25.050> higher<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> back<00:00:25.590> than<00:00:26.010> factory<00:00:26.430> but

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
bit higher in the back than factory but

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.240 
bit higher in the back than factory but
it<00:00:27.240> gives<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.539> significantly<00:00:28.500> better<00:00:28.710> handling

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it gives a significantly better handling

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.830 
it gives a significantly better handling
and<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> significantly<00:00:30.150> better<00:00:30.420> ride<00:00:31.520> the

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
and a significantly better ride the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
and a significantly better ride the
stalks<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> normally<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> taillights

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
I thought I'd take a second to do a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.140 
I thought I'd take a second to do a
quick<00:03:42.170> walk<00:03:42.650> around<00:03:42.680> video<00:03:43.250> showcasing<00:03:43.970> some

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
of the mods first and the biggest

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.170 
of the mods first and the biggest
improvement<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.319> record<00:03:48.739> shocks<00:03:49.180> those

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
improvement is the record shocks those

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.089 
improvement is the record shocks those
are<00:03:50.360> twelve<00:03:50.599> inch<00:03:50.780> shocks<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.379> raises<00:03:51.950> the
