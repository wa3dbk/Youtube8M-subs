00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you know a lot of people thought that it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.690 
you know a lot of people thought that it
was<00:01:59.369> gonna<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.640> basically<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.299> same<00:02:00.479> body<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
was gonna be basically the same body and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.179 
was gonna be basically the same body and
they're<00:02:02.700> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.920> same

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
they're kind of right it is the same

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.650 
they're kind of right it is the same
print<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:06.030> different<00:02:06.390> colors<00:02:06.750> more<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.259> less

print with different colors more or less

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.320 
print with different colors more or less
but<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.319> looks<00:02:10.349> cool<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.370> Cape<00:02:11.670> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
but I think it looks cool this Cape it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.580 
but I think it looks cool this Cape it
looks<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.900> package

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
looks on the package

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.229 
looks on the package
to<00:02:14.280> be<00:02:14.510> dark<00:02:15.510> red<00:02:15.989> almost<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.730> actually

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
to be dark red almost but it's actually

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.160 
to be dark red almost but it's actually
kind<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.690> brown<00:02:19.019> color<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:20.840> would<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:21.930> liked

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
kind of a brown color I would have liked

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.229 
kind of a brown color I would have liked
toasting<00:02:22.530> it'd<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.739> really<00:02:23.519> more<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:24.000> dark

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
toasting it'd be really more of a dark

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.960 
toasting it'd be really more of a dark
red<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.170> does<00:02:25.500> look<00:02:25.800> Brown<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:26.819> not

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
red but it does look Brown and I'm not

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.820 
red but it does look Brown and I'm not
sure<00:02:27.120> if<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.330> was<00:02:27.420> accidental<00:02:27.690> maybe<00:02:28.650> they

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
sure if that was accidental maybe they

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.890 
sure if that was accidental maybe they
meant<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.580> dark<00:02:29.849> red<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.299> don't<00:02:30.510> know
