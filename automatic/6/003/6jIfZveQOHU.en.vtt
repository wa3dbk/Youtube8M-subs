00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hi guys, here I am again and I want a short Advent now 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.470
 give 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 he i am meanwhile again ridiculous or campaigns on from the TA 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.610
 out of the feeling that otherwise it has so beloved organizer January the granary has that dead 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.579
 not even the heroes are completely automated 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.639
 instead of the receipt of the registration this evidenced against fire damaged 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:24.269
 on 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.859
 We already have enough of those and have a hero fighting Hansa 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.449
 Deceased Popstar all get that I no longer the whole place 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.720
 need to beat each one over the pile 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.240
 and this will work with them soon 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.030
 We have stayed here last October, which is exactly what prestige is 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 mills 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 No you can not build on the mixed so for example 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.130
 a crisis is Montreal 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.200
 I can now that others with huge on carrier times gossip what 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.390
 happens 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.850
 the effort with these things you just beautify then beautiful 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.170
 gets thereby also prestige projects 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.550
 and can extend it further with No prison cells for example 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.090
 all functions so that the heroes are attracted by these 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.090
 Mix Prestige So you build a way for them I have an entrance 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.670
 Percent 50 seconds comes the next wave 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.470
 they will arrive here 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.700
 and are attracted by the mixes that are here in this room 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 at the same time a few treasure chests have been set up tight 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.960
 Brown the gimmicks are like for example the cats here are lighter and 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.240
 that suck this stuff 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.430
 the kids sure a seed a little bit of gold and rejoice thereby the rises 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.860
 Series Media 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.220
 then you see up there's more stuff 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.900
 and walk up the hall here 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.770
 at her are also enjoying these shelves and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.830
 the pretty Neil Youngs years to the ceasefire of campfires 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.400
 and then they know already in the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.060
 deadly trap 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.580
 my whole skeletons around 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 the problem is still there 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.209
 I see that as you see above I have 18 out of 20 people to build one up 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.120
 So I can not really grow that big, do not know if his club with 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.369
 that you can do this optimally 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:21.669
 or if you notice it kind of the second mission of a campaign 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:22.929
 Michler 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.939
 so will be observed 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.259
 oan mugs also have a lot of things not yet available 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.029
 that is exactly what they have in their minds and treasures 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.219
 Crinkle straight in here as I wanted 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:40.179
 in Minden have with the cherish and collected already got a few 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:46.779
 Little dots on them very dear was never in a store here five were new 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.499
 Discover solutions Neidhardt 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 yesterday he was pleased 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.009
 and outside Hometown Stoner ca 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.009
 I have not seen it that way yet 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.389
 and during a hopefully equal lure here found for mind 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.849
 the mix in that direction 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.149
 and there comes one soon and wants to keep the treasure chest filled up 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.239
 own com / shop made Ströhl says Katz 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.299
 yes Love One Last Year Löw «So Bauer the inhabitants once Hermann Petz 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.969
 have set up 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
 and want to stop next Saturday 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.089
 and now 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:24.939
 he's trapped now 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.239
 behind them a victory ARAG 04 goes to lure the OPC 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.649
 and 3 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.949
 but that goes wrong 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.019
 So horn idea would be 90 million stubby monsters six out of six 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.039
 Hours everything parried 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:46.579
 Martina Steffen dpa riches Maria a helmet duty indicates against 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.900
 his route at short notice 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.530
 So it was with many old Anspacher percent then it is again 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.199
 so far 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.040
 as the half of the lot also here satisfies need satisfaction 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:01.129
 they are damaged by our monsters 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.199
 to get 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.579
 and you see my Koblenz by the collar / were closer opponents 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.809
 DC just fresh and local traffic 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.689
 Carry animals beat opponents or pass out defeated opponents 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.909
 jail cell 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.769
 and here around Krümmel screamed the soul energy what slowly out through him 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.499
 the captivity 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.499
 Thier and 2 is how the mechanics work in Daniel Lüns 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.219
 Althoff with it and now here I hate my short last 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.979
 to lock 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.759
 and then maybe someone of you will get it out right now 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.219
 always works so well Super effective learning makes 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.720
 then post just like the answer 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.210
 that I'll see that, too 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.599
 a by then Klös
