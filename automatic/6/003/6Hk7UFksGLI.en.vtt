00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
do too much research into what this ball

do too much research into what this ball
is<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> like<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.939> this<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is going to be like but I think this is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.800 
is going to be like but I think this is
her<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> flow<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:23.510> like<00:00:24.510> as

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
her like going with the flow and like as

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.609 
her like going with the flow and like as
the<00:00:25.230> days<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.990> went<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> flow<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the days go on I went with the flow a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:40.729 
the days go on I went with the flow a
lot<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:35.510> broken<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:38.120> failed<00:00:39.120> attempt<00:00:39.750> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
lot more broken down failed attempt so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.220 
lot more broken down failed attempt so
I've<00:00:41.190> ridden<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> boards<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I've ridden a lot of boards and a lot of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
I've ridden a lot of boards and a lot of
years<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:45.149> there's<00:00:45.300> definitely<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
years and I think there's definitely a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
years and I think there's definitely a
pressure<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.649> riding<00:00:47.340> along<00:00:47.670> towards<00:00:48.000> blame

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
pressure that riding along towards blame

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.119 
pressure that riding along towards blame
or<00:00:48.780> riding<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> shape<00:00:49.620> board<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
or riding up on the shape board is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.090 
or riding up on the shape board is
recouped<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
recouped and that you have to be a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
recouped and that you have to be a
potato<00:00:53.730> chip<00:00:54.000> rider

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
potato chip rider

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350 
potato chip rider
trying<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.710> start<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.160> doing<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:57.000> short<00:00:57.180> for

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
trying to start out doing more short for

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
trying to start out doing more short for
driving<00:00:57.720> here<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.130> I<00:00:59.160> realized<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
driving here and then I realized I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.979 
driving here and then I realized I
wasn't<00:00:59.850> having<00:01:00.060> as<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.420> fun<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.550> I

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
wasn't having as much fun and I

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
wasn't having as much fun and I
ultimately<00:01:03.989> decided<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.370> fun

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ultimately decided to do what was fun

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
ultimately decided to do what was fun
and<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.510> catch<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.440> waves<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:08.610> did

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and to catch a lot of waves and I did

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
and to catch a lot of waves and I did
that<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.570> picked<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.290> fun<00:01:10.500> board

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
that and just picked up some fun board

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730 
that and just picked up some fun board
and<00:01:11.190> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> end<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> day<00:01:13.440> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and I think at the end of the day I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
and I think at the end of the day I
think<00:01:14.250> my<00:01:14.460> philosophy<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.780> older

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
think my philosophy is as I get older

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.670 
think my philosophy is as I get older
I'm<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.860> gonna<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.250> fun<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.350> I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
I'm just gonna have fun and you know I'm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
I'm just gonna have fun and you know I'm
not<00:01:19.800> doing<00:01:20.160> this<00:01:20.190> for<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> living<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
not doing this for to make a living so I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.500 
not doing this for to make a living so I
think<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.220> rid<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> sort<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
think if you get rid of that sort of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.639 
think if you get rid of that sort of
baggage<00:01:25.729> have<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:27.060> more<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:28.470> you'll

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
cold and cruel infection you know if

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.260 
cold and cruel infection you know if
you're<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.780> you're<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.020> good<00:02:21.400> surfer<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:23.090> can

you're if you're a good surfer you can

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.750 
you're if you're a good surfer you can
kind<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.630> write<00:02:23.810> anything<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:25.190> don't<00:02:25.700> know

maybe you're like more like a retro

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.540 
maybe you're like more like a retro
