this is the rosette stitch it's a four

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.710 
this is the rosette stitch it's a four
row<00:00:07.800> repeat<00:00:07.830> worked<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.820> an<00:00:08.970> even<00:00:09.360> number<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:09.720 
row repeat worked on an even number of

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.650 
row repeat worked on an even number of
stitches<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.580> I'm<00:00:11.580> gonna<00:00:11.790> show<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.120> Row<00:00:12.599> two

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
stitches and I'm gonna show you Row two

stitches and I'm gonna show you Row two
of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> pattern<00:00:13.650> only<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.999> because<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.419> think

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
of the pattern only just because I think

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.510 
of the pattern only just because I think
that<00:00:15.959> is<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> road<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.800> most<00:00:17.039> people<00:00:17.370> would

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
that is the road that most people would

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.450 
that is the road that most people would
have<00:00:17.670> trouble<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.240> rows<00:00:19.140> 1<00:00:19.470> &amp;<00:00:19.650> 3<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:20.220> the

exactly the same as row to accept that

exactly the same as row to accept that

this<00:00:39.539> little<00:00:39.749> sample<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.769> 14<00:00:41.309> stitches<00:00:41.519> on

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
this little sample I have 14 stitches on

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020 
this little sample I have 14 stitches on
my<00:00:42.059> needle<00:00:42.179> and<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.710> yarn<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.249> baby's<00:00:44.999> first

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
my needle and the yarn is baby's first

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.809 
my needle and the yarn is baby's first
by<00:00:45.929> lion<00:00:46.409> brand<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.219> cotton<00:00:47.550> acrylic

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
by lion brand it's a cotton acrylic

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.930 
by lion brand it's a cotton acrylic
blend<00:00:48.359> and<00:00:48.859> I'm<00:00:49.859> using<00:00:50.039> size<00:00:50.399> 7<00:00:50.909> needles<00:00:51.359> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
blend and I'm using size 7 needles and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.239 
blend and I'm using size 7 needles and
even<00:00:53.940> though<00:00:54.089> this<00:00:54.269> yarn<00:00:54.659> is<00:00:54.989> nice<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.620> soft

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
even though this yarn is nice and soft

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.759 
even though this yarn is nice and soft
and<00:00:56.640> squishy<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.479> don't<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.319> like<00:00:58.559> it

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
and squishy I don't really like it

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.489 
and squishy I don't really like it
because<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.519> does<00:00:59.819> this<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.929> hate<00:01:01.170> yarn

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
because it does this and I hate yarn

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.719 
because it does this and I hate yarn
that<00:01:02.429> does<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.250> probably<00:01:05.640> just

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that does this so this is probably just

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.800 
that does this so this is probably just
going<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.240> sit<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.140> stash<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.810> collect

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
going to sit in my stash and collect

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.010 
going to sit in my stash and collect
dust<00:01:10.430> or<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:12.030> probably<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> for

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
dust or I will probably just use it for

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
dust or I will probably just use it for
samples<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> anyway<00:01:15.329> moving<00:01:15.630> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.680 

tricky<00:01:18.990> part<00:01:19.260> of<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> pattern<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
tricky part of this pattern is that you

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.090 
tricky part of this pattern is that you
are<00:01:22.430> purling<00:01:23.430> two<00:01:23.790> stitches<00:01:24.270> together<00:01:24.510> and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
are purling two stitches together and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
are purling two stitches together and
then<00:01:26.100> before<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> drop<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.240> off<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> left

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
then before you drop them off the left

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
then before you drop them off the left
needle<00:01:27.900> you're<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.370> knit<00:01:29.880> them

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
needle you're also going to knit them

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.990 
needle you're also going to knit them
together<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.640> purl<00:01:38.640> two

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
together so to do that you just purl two

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.790 
together so to do that you just purl two
together<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.260> you<00:01:40.290> don't<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
together and if you don't know how to

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.840 
together and if you don't know how to
purl<00:01:41.100> two<00:01:41.340> together<00:01:41.690> it's<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:43.520> next<00:01:44.520> two

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
purl two together it's the next two

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.630 
purl two together it's the next two
stitches<00:01:45.120> on<00:01:45.570> your<00:01:45.600> needle<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.350> just

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
stitches on your needle you would just

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
stitches on your needle you would just
pretend<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.940> you're<00:01:48.240> purling<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.930> but

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
pretend like you're purling one but

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.350 
pretend like you're purling one but
you're<00:01:49.320> purling<00:01:49.830> two<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.400> same<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:53.360> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
you're purling two at the same time and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.380 
you're purling two at the same time and
then<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.200> yarn<00:01:55.470> goes<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
then the yarn goes to the back of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.090 
then the yarn goes to the back of the
work<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> position<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.670> knit<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
work so you're in a position to knit and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.290 
work so you're in a position to knit and
then<00:02:03.680> knit<00:02:04.680> those<00:02:04.950> same<00:02:05.250> two<00:02:05.640> stitches

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
then knit those same two stitches

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
then knit those same two stitches
together<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.990> if<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> don't<00:02:10.830> know<00:02:11.010> how<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
together and if you don't know how to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.270 
together and if you don't know how to
knit<00:02:11.490> two<00:02:11.790> together<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.800> opposite

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
knit two together it's just the opposite

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.100 
knit two together it's just the opposite
of<00:02:14.430> purling<00:02:14.820> two<00:02:15.030> together<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.480> take<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.900> two

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
of purling two together you take the two

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.890 
of purling two together you take the two
stitches<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.860> work<00:02:17.370> them<00:02:17.640> as<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.750> it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
stitches and just work them as if it

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.210 
stitches and just work them as if it
were<00:02:18.990> only<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.590> stitch<00:02:20.180> oops<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.560> you're

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
were only one stitch oops and you're

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.890 
were only one stitch oops and you're
just<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.269> way<00:02:27.510> across

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
just going to do that all the way across

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
just going to do that all the way across
the<00:02:28.260> second<00:02:28.620> row<00:02:30.019> purl<00:02:31.019> two<00:02:31.440> together<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the second row purl two together and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.540

and I have a little bit of trouble with
this<00:02:51.870> stitch<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.439> I'm<00:02:52.799> kind<00:02:53.159> of<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.579> tight

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
this stitch because I'm kind of a tight

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.250 
this stitch because I'm kind of a tight
knit<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.209> sometimes<00:02:54.689> and<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:57.599> get<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> needle

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
knit or sometimes and to get the needle

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
in here to make the knit two together is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:11.589 
in here to make the knit two together is
a<00:03:00.959> little<00:03:01.370> tricky

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.530 

and<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:12.409> not<00:03:12.530> gonna<00:03:12.739> bore<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.340> with

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
finishing the row here I think you get

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.459 
finishing the row here I think you get
the<00:03:17.180> idea<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:19.030> purling<00:03:20.030> two<00:03:20.329> together<00:03:20.749> like

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
the idea of purling two together like

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:28.330 
the idea of purling two together like
this<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:24.349> then<00:03:25.389> knitting<00:03:26.439> two<00:03:27.439> together<00:03:27.739> like

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
this and then knitting two together like

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.839 
this and then knitting two together like
this<00:03:34.090> then<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.239> get<00:03:35.389> this<00:03:35.569> really<00:03:36.019> lovely

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
this then you get this really lovely

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.690 
this then you get this really lovely
textured<00:03:38.409> fabric<00:03:39.409> this<00:03:39.829> is<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:40.189> right<00:03:40.370> side

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
textured fabric this is the right side

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.319 
textured fabric this is the right side
but<00:03:41.569> if<00:03:41.719> you<00:03:41.840> look<00:03:41.989> at<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.409> wrong<00:03:42.650> side<00:03:43.329> it's

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
but if you look at the wrong side it's

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.869 
but if you look at the wrong side it's
not<00:03:44.569> that<00:03:44.780> ugly<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.469> would<00:03:46.189> say<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.669> could

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
not that ugly I would say that you could

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.000 
not that ugly I would say that you could
probably<00:03:47.950> reverse<00:03:48.950> these<00:03:49.219> if<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.180> wanted<00:03:50.449> to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
probably reverse these if you wanted to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.960 
probably reverse these if you wanted to
but<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:53.169> the<00:03:54.169> rosette<00:03:54.620> stitch

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.030
