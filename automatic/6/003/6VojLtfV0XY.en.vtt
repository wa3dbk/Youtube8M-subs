was<00:02:59.250> really<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.880> annoying<00:03:00.150> especially

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
was really really annoying especially

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.990 
was really really annoying especially
like<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.830> way<00:03:01.980> my<00:03:02.010> defense<00:03:02.520> tripped<00:03:02.820> over

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
like the way my defense tripped over

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.760 
like the way my defense tripped over
each<00:03:03.210> other<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.780> yeah<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.530> how<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.650> game

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
each other so yeah that is how the game

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.340 
each other so yeah that is how the game
meant<00:03:05.130> we<00:03:05.400> had<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:06.060> into<00:03:06.300> extra<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:07.110> I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
meant we had to go into extra time I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.170 
meant we had to go into extra time I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
with two to one as you can see again

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.160 
with two to one as you can see again
from<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> stats<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.510> was<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> really<00:03:39.959> really

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
from the stats it was a really really

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.680 
from the stats it was a really really
close<00:03:40.410> game<00:03:40.470> especially<00:03:41.150> especially<00:03:42.150> during

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
close game especially especially during

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.720 
close game especially especially during
extra<00:03:42.989> time<00:03:43.080> my<00:03:43.380> opponent<00:03:43.800> also<00:03:44.070> got<00:03:44.340> another

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
extra time my opponent also got another

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.010 
extra time my opponent also got another
chance<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.270> it<00:03:45.330> could<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.630> gone<00:03:45.750> either<00:03:45.840> way

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
chance so it could have gone either way

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.500 
chance so it could have gone either way
I<00:03:46.110> guess<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.920> anyway<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.489> go<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.910> what<00:03:48.300> will<00:03:48.420> be

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
I guess but anyway we go in what will be

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.330 
I guess but anyway we go in what will be

which you can do actually with the left
and<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.009> right<00:04:51.069> trigger<00:04:51.520> if<00:04:51.729> you<00:04:51.880> behold<00:04:52.150> them

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.620 
again with safety we go with the in-air
elastico<00:05:15.009> to<00:05:15.130> be<00:05:15.250> two<00:05:15.520> defenders<00:05:16.090> we<00:05:16.240> went<00:05:16.449> for

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
elastico to be two defenders we went for

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.899 
elastico to be two defenders we went for
a<00:05:16.690> nice<00:05:16.930> shot<00:05:17.229> but<00:05:17.409> again<00:05:17.710> it's<00:05:17.949> goalkeepers

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
a nice shot but again it's goalkeepers

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.760 
a nice shot but again it's goalkeepers
there<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.210> save<00:05:19.449> it<00:05:19.599> another<00:05:19.960> big<00:05:20.289> chance<00:05:20.560> with

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
there to save it another big chance with

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.350 
there to save it another big chance with
safety<00:05:21.130> where<00:05:21.580> we<00:05:21.699> probably<00:05:22.090> could<00:05:22.330> have

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
safety where we probably could have

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.570 
safety where we probably could have
completed<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:23.050> challenge<00:05:23.470> but<00:05:23.590> once<00:05:23.830> again<00:05:24.009> we

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
completed a challenge but once again we

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.920 
completed a challenge but once again we
just<00:05:24.789> couldn't<00:05:25.090> put<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.300> into<00:05:25.569> the<00:05:25.690> back<00:05:25.870> of

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
just couldn't put it into the back of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.170 
just couldn't put it into the back of
the<00:05:26.169> net<00:05:26.319> a<00:05:26.349> real<00:05:26.650> real<00:05:26.889> shame<00:05:27.250> then<00:05:27.550> we<00:05:27.909> move

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
the net a real real shame then we move

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.300 
the net a real real shame then we move
on<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.449> will<00:05:28.659> be<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:29.289> final<00:05:29.560> game<00:05:29.919> of<00:05:30.069> this

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
on it will be the final game of this

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.879 
on it will be the final game of this
episode<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:31.060> we<00:05:31.120> come<00:05:31.599> up<00:05:31.659> against<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.050> really

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
episode and we come up against a really

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.170 
episode and we come up against a really
really<00:05:33.009> weird<00:05:33.250> team<00:05:33.430> as<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:33.639> can<00:05:33.759> see<00:05:33.940> all<00:05:34.090> of

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
really weird team as you can see all of

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.580 
really weird team as you can see all of
his<00:05:34.479> players<00:05:34.810> were<00:05:34.990> pretty<00:05:35.229> much<00:05:35.380> alone

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
his players were pretty much alone

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.770 
his players were pretty much alone
players<00:05:35.949> and<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.820> do<00:05:36.880> believe<00:05:37.240> this<00:05:37.449> was<00:05:37.630> a

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
players and I do believe this was a

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.719 
players and I do believe this was a
subscriber<00:05:38.380> actually<00:05:38.740> from<00:05:38.949> Germany<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.400> can

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
subscriber actually from Germany I can

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.399 
subscriber actually from Germany I can
maybe<00:05:39.880> hear<00:05:40.120> him<00:05:40.270> in<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.419> background<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:41.020> was

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
maybe hear him in the background I was

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:42.719 
maybe hear him in the background I was
actually<00:05:41.710> pretty<00:05:41.860> good<00:05:42.039> at<00:05:42.099> skin<00:05:42.400> was<00:05:42.550> as<00:05:42.580> you

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
actually pretty good at skin was as you

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.129 
actually pretty good at skin was as you
can<00:05:42.849> see<00:05:43.030> right<00:05:43.060> there<00:05:43.360> pulling<00:05:43.630> off<00:05:43.780> skin<00:05:44.020> was

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
can see right there pulling off skin was

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.689 
can see right there pulling off skin was
with<00:05:44.320> Garrett<00:05:44.620> bill<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.039> he<00:05:45.460> was<00:05:45.580> actually

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
with Garrett bill and he was actually

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.700 
with Garrett bill and he was actually
playing<00:05:46.120> pretty<00:05:46.509> decent<00:05:47.020> despite<00:05:47.349> the<00:05:47.500> fact

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
playing pretty decent despite the fact

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.279 
playing pretty decent despite the fact
that<00:05:47.830> his<00:05:48.009> team<00:05:48.219> only<00:05:48.669> at<00:05:48.789> like<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.270> think<00:05:49.690> 46

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
that his team only at like I think 46

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.839 
that his team only at like I think 46
chemistry<00:05:50.800> and<00:05:51.009> some<00:05:51.310> of<00:05:51.400> his<00:05:51.460> players<00:05:51.699> were

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
chemistry and some of his players were

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.760 
chemistry and some of his players were
actually<00:05:52.120> on<00:05:52.180> three<00:05:52.449> chemistry<00:05:52.900> as<00:05:53.020> well<00:05:53.229> but

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
actually on three chemistry as well but

minute it's my opponent on the boat I
once<00:06:31.210> again<00:06:31.509> with<00:06:31.690> Garrett<00:06:32.020> bill<00:06:32.169> pulling<00:06:32.530> off

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
once again with Garrett bill pulling off

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.290 
once again with Garrett bill pulling off
a<00:06:32.740> few<00:06:32.919> skill<00:06:33.190> Musa<00:06:33.610> flicks<00:06:33.909> it<00:06:34.000> out<00:06:34.120> with<00:06:34.270> a

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
a few skill Musa flicks it out with a

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.969 
a few skill Musa flicks it out with a
rainbow<00:06:34.509> flake<00:06:34.870> I<00:06:35.050> try<00:06:35.349> to<00:06:35.409> clear<00:06:35.740> the<00:06:35.860> way

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
rainbow flake I try to clear the way

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.980 
rainbow flake I try to clear the way
then<00:06:36.460> he<00:06:36.490> goes<00:06:36.610> to<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:36.880> valley<00:06:37.180> with<00:06:37.419> Ramsey

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
then he goes to the valley with Ramsey

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.510 
then he goes to the valley with Ramsey
which<00:06:38.169> in<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.500> end<00:06:38.560> was<00:06:38.800> a<00:06:38.830> pretty<00:06:39.070> easy<00:06:39.159> say

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
which in the end was a pretty easy say

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.350 
which in the end was a pretty easy say
fourth<00:06:39.789> ave

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
fourth ave

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.629 
fourth ave
so<00:06:40.599> that<00:06:40.990> is<00:06:41.110> how<00:06:41.229> the<00:06:41.289> game<00:06:41.590> in<00:06:41.770> it<00:06:41.889> won<00:06:42.400> a<00:06:42.430> game
