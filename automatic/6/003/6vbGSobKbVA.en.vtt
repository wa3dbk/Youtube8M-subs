00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.509
 hello to you flex of and today I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.910
 I would like to show you one trick 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.230
 we successfully used ours with platoon 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 heart we are in battle 8 level on 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.890
 seventh tanks frontal projection of which 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.429
 punch all enemies in this battle of ours 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 the main task was to help 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.899
 pushing the direction of the second 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.000
 line and further after successfully completed 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.590
 tasks we decided to return to defense 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 bases 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.190
 note that the enemy isu 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 back from line six and yours 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.370
 shot almost a third of our team we 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.309
 we are going to defend the base and are facing us 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 full top of 3 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.550
 after carrying out certain 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.629
 manipulations we exchanged our 800 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.979
 health fulovogo a top strand of the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 which is pretty good in my opinion 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 indicator while you need to act 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.610
 It was very fast since the ninth 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.010
 the lines 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.990
 some more were coming 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.340
 opponents 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.549
 It should be noted that the remaining two 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 against so many enemies 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.030
 we no longer expected to win but 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.020
 However, we did not give up and did everything 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.020
 what was in our power 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.430
 after successfully repelling the attack 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.560
 the main part of the enemies we stayed in 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.220
 principle together as a class 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.729
 we no longer expected 2 vanity 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.500
 seventh tank 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.800
 against two of the eight artillery sevens 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.320
 quite an unpleasant deal with that 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.890
 we did not know how many hp left 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.860
 at enemy tanks we drove first 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.369
 together on this hill but after i 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.640
 suggested putting a panther on a square 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.660
 k0 for several reasons first declination 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.110
 guns at the panther 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.870
 pretty bad secondly no more 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.420
 effectively in this case was to arrange 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.519
 with an ambush from two directions would like 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.720
 note that this fight was played before 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.780
 nerf bushes and think that in version 0 8 7 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.150
 panther with no shot most likely was 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.750
 would be illuminated but nevertheless this 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.810
 the catch of live bait I think will 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.730
 relevant on many cards only 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.380
 condition what you need to put 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 your ally a little further on this 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.750
 distance so after shot he's not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.620
 was lit on like any good 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.299
 fishing needs to be carefully prepared and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.500
 keep quiet as bait 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.780
 pretty bitten 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.410
 but the less appetizing French 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:14.260
 M4 tank roll which I managed our 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:22.570
 fisherman with a fishing rod from panther understood 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:27.450
 shooting enemies by default my task was 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.870
 highlight and survive as long as possible 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.690
 while enemies 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.090
 trying to get your tank stock 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.129
 ally can safely produce 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 shooting is very important in this case 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.290
 is that act bait 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.319
 you need to be extremely careful not to get 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.319
 damage 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.579
 using this method we have already shot 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.730
 two enemies and left both juice and enemy 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.640
 bumblebee for a long time I've been browsing 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.420
 ninth line since from the back 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.910
 the enemy must climb very high 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:38.800
 long and likely that he 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:41.650
 lit up becoming round lit up 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.990
 enemy Hummel but I don't know where else 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.060
 is issue 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:53.440
 so I roll back and for a long time 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:55.570
 I try to be out of the light despite 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.810
 that Jesus shone on ac3 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.640
 she could easily drive around edel by 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.600
 9 lines or with the direction of the bridge therefore 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.800
 I occasionally rolled back closer to 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.680
 ninth line gazed to that side at 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.290
 so that she does not catch us by surprise 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:23.080
 as we see, we are quite successful 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.690
 applied this technique and pulled pretty 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.700
 hopeless battle in vantage tanks 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.790
 itâ€™s good for the fight 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.380
 have done much more than most 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.930
 top tanks and thus once again 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.919
 ordered what you need to fight to the end 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.080
 and always expect to win hope 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.970
 that you were interested thank you for 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.970
 attention and see you soon
