pistol<00:00:06.509> normally<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> wanted<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:08.069> mods<00:00:08.340> like

pistol normally I wanted do mods like

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.400 
pistol normally I wanted do mods like
this<00:00:08.820> because<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.480> not<00:00:10.080> something<00:00:10.380> that

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
this because it's not something that

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.830 
this because it's not something that
fits<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.920> skyrim<00:00:11.519> era<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> time<00:00:12.360> set<00:00:12.690> is

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
fits the skyrim era in the time set is

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.320 
fits the skyrim era in the time set is
set<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.490> actually<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:15.210> really

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
set in but I actually really really

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.260 
set in but I actually really really
liked<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> mod<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.460> reasons<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
liked the mod for reasons not because of

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.000 
liked the mod for reasons not because of
what<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> mod<00:00:18.810> supposed<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:19.740> what

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
what the mod supposed to do but what

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640 
what the mod supposed to do but what
it's<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.460> supposed<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.410> that's<00:00:22.410> when

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it's not supposed to do and that's when

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
it's not supposed to do and that's when
you<00:00:22.830> kill<00:00:23.100> people<00:00:23.210> if<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.359> time<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.600> perfectly

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you kill people if you time it perfectly

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
you kill people if you time it perfectly
before<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:26.220> die<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> parallelization

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
before they die from the parallelization

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109 
before they die from the parallelization
or<00:00:27.990> whatever<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> fire<00:00:29.519> burning<00:00:29.880> or

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
or whatever or the fire burning or

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.120 
or whatever or the fire burning or
whatever<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.630> happening<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> them<00:00:31.439> they

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
whatever it's happening to them they

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
whatever it's happening to them they
live<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> air<00:00:33.239> when<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> kill<00:00:33.960> him<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
live in the air when you kill him like a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.990 
live in the air when you kill him like a
bomb<00:00:34.559> went<00:00:34.739> off<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.640> funny<00:00:35.850> just

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
bomb went off and it's funny just

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670 
bomb went off and it's funny just
watching<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.510> flying<00:00:36.750> around<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.230> floating

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
watching them flying around and floating

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
watching them flying around and floating
and<00:00:37.800> send<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.340> down<00:00:38.610> into<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> ground<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and send back down into the ground it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
and send back down into the ground it
adds<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.350> humor<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.980> me<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> hopefully

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
adds a little humor for me and hopefully

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
adds a little humor for me and hopefully
for<00:00:42.450> everyone<00:00:42.750> else<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.920> bug

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
for everyone else it is a bug

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
for everyone else it is a bug
unfortunately<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.270> hopefully<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> Mater

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
unfortunately so hopefully the Mater

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.170 
unfortunately so hopefully the Mater
knows<00:00:46.890> about<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.340> wants<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> keep<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
knows about it and wants to keep it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
knows about it and wants to keep it
because<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.050> adds<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.610> said

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because it adds a little like I said

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
because it adds a little like I said

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
if you're charging up the gun to shoot

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
if you're charging up the gun to shoot
you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> hear<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.859> could<00:01:02.039> hear<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> fire

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

spell<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.690> creating<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.339> they

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
spell that it's creating because they

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
spell that it's creating because they
use<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> fire<00:01:06.060> spell<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.020> i<00:01:07.200> think

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
use the fire spell to do this i think

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

I don't want to be holding back the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.179 
I don't want to be holding back the
trigger<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.070> hearing<00:01:27.530> me<00:01:28.530> charging<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
trigger and hearing me charging up a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.310 
trigger and hearing me charging up a
spell<00:01:29.549> maybe<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> modder<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.020> he<00:01:31.170> ever

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
spell maybe if the modder if he ever

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
spell maybe if the modder if he ever
does<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.979> maybe<00:01:32.220> he<00:01:32.490> knows<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
does see this maybe he knows about it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.700 
does see this maybe he knows about it
maybe<00:01:33.570> he<00:01:33.720> doesn't<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:34.020> about<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
maybe he doesn't know about it and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
maybe he doesn't know about it and
hopefully<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.340> fixed<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.150> that's<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> only

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
hopefully it's fixed so that's the only

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710
