00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.840
Welcome to my new
channel.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.670
This channel is a project that I have of
diffusion of some habits of life more

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.647
healthy and more ecological, of a more responsible consumption.

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:16.320
Let nobody be frightened by the name of the channel 
"V of Vegana"

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.880
I'm not going to try to make anyone vegan, that's a personal choice,
[* I do not see it like this anymore, let's veganicemos the world! *]

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.480
but I would like to add little habits

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.860
that can make our stay on this planet a little less destructive.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.640
Above all, what interests me is that everything is ecological and that there is no animal abuse.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.600
You already know that, especially in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, animal testing takes place.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.540
This implies that animals are used to make toxicity and resistance tests

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.160
the product that we are trying to sell through a process of torture [and murder] of these animals.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.795
I'm not going to put unpleasant images, whoever wants to can search in google

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.880
and you will find a lot of information about it.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.800
What I want is to avoid that we continue collaborating with it, collaborating a little less with the companies that make them.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.480
Therefore I will try to teach you different methods:

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.800
I will teach you cosmetics, natural remedies ... I am a masseuse, because I can teach you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.780
techniques to eliminate pain without
need to go to medications

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.140
and other chemical substances that are also harmful to our health.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.420
On the other hand, apart from animal testing
and the ecological impact, either because it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
they release toxic gases in their production or by the plastic of the containers that are consumed.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.280
For example in cosmetics, remains of ...

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.120
remains of petrochemicals that are used for example to give texture, color, smell ... they stay in our body.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
Many of them [of the companies] say that "they are innocuous quantities" ...

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.380
Yes, they are innocuous amounts, but the
Most remain accumulated in our body,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.399
in our organs, our tissues ... that
apart from staying in our body and resulting

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.340
harmful to us, remains
products used in factories pass rivers

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.480
and are incorporated into the metabolism of aquatic flora and fauna.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.380
These toxins have different effects on our body:

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.600
some are carcinogenic, they create
respiratory problems, allergies ...

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.260
My idea is to eliminate all this, at the
of health and ethically, in terms of animal testing,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.440
on an ecological level ...

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.900
I will give you small remedies so that you can change your habits.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.520
For me, with each person who follows this channel

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.000
change only one of your habits, it would be a great achievement.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.280
If someone takes a run and begins to change something else, and when he realizes it is vegan,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.640
what happened to me,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.560
It would be a real achievement for me.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.960
Well, nothing more,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.740
just tell you that for those
maybe a little more lazy,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.980
for them there is Susana's store
Blanco, my great mentor,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.400
that from here I send a huge greeting,

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:08.830
and there you can buy all the products already made, and of course you can participate in the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.880
courses that she offers, where she will teach you a lot of recipes so that

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.760
you can ride your little one
natural cosmetics laboratory at home.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.400
Well, nothing more, I hope you subscribe to my channel

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.720
I hope you like it a lot and above all that it has an effect and that we can really go

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.635
changing our habits little by little.

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:34.320
In short, so that between all we take care a little more the planet, the animals and our body,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.900
that we only have one and we have to take care of it.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.540
So nothing more. In the first video I will show you how to make a mascara or homemade eyeliner.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.120
I wait for you in the next video.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.600
Ciao!
