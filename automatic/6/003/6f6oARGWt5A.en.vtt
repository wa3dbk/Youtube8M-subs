oh my god in my imeem he bought caught
my<00:01:41.579> eye<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.600> was<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.140> tough<00:01:43.290> experience<00:01:43.560> for

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
my eye out it was a tough experience for

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.960 
my eye out it was a tough experience for
me<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> took<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> couple<00:01:44.460> days<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.909> over

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
me it took me a couple days to get over

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
me it took me a couple days to get over
that<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.220> probably<00:01:47.399> take<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that but I think I probably take a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
that but I think I probably take a
Gatorade<00:01:48.299> shower<00:01:48.540> instead<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.049> could

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
Gatorade shower instead I could

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.679 
Gatorade shower instead I could
definitely<00:01:49.680> deal<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.490> than

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
definitely deal with that more than

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
definitely deal with that more than
shaving<00:01:51.689> cream<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:51.960> your<00:01:52.110> eye

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
shaving cream in your eye

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.029

so you have the ford raptor do you

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.469

consider<00:01:56.310> yourself<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.789> truck<00:01:57.030> type<00:01:57.270> rather

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
consider yourself the truck type rather

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.330 
consider yourself the truck type rather
than<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> fast<00:01:58.020> car<00:01:58.259> definitely<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.100> truck
