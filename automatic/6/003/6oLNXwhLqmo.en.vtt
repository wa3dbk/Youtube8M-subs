00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:10.009
 My videos are also getting more and more access to channels 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:15.409
 So you will receive a variety of personal messages, but a little 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:20.250
 Well somehow and Toka or return reply you have what the say so what I think it would be unreasonable 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:26.100
 It I eventually end is supposed to say'm not my relationship 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 Well, that's right I was also pointed out with a friend or nearer , but that's parent-child correspondence 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.150
 not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.790
 However 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.850
 I'd like to know, but I 'm not saying I'm not working alone in the world 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 I think there are places that bother you in various strange ways 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.370
 Well if it was what I said 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.570
 So 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.140
 I apologize but I list other than it be otherwise 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.540
 Please contact the person who made it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.650
 There Well a little trouble where even I it is not a sincere response is said Te corresponding syrups 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.910
 I will 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.990
 First of all good things that have been told first to the wide record of two-channel Toka amazon 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.760
 vine or something 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:12.640
 I'm cooked but I 'm using the feature to see if it's related 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:13.640
 For example, when I finish playing my video, I 'm related to the related video next to it 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.610
 I do not mean that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:30.500
 The person who sees the person's hobbies If you look at my animation, you see what 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:33.440
 Would you not me most that day called Ah Looking at that my videos on it in the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.630
 After all American songs called Nemura 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.159
 so 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 Person's jump ringlight the fire cd that the cd 4 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:49.250
 Was like the video you are playing Ru surround the record is there are people who are associated with something 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:55.460
 This open reel with a tape of something open rill is put out there 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.710
 However, it is just in the face position and it is always carried around and something is said 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.370
 Me 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.100
 Previous 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.100
 I say because it is now, but it feels like it doesn't matter- 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 It will be fine 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:17.170
 I think I do not matter Well if it is said that it is not a genuine response 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.170
 I think I can not help but I think that is a bit unreasonable 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.599
 Also like the site site called Car at Nifty or channel with me 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 Such the same way 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.810
 That nifty 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.890
 It is an original nifty-serve less but I'm running there 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:41.490
 There is a car information video festival video channel that it 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:45.990
 It is bad feeling I'd video comes out, such as the wavy softening at first what or black screen 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.530
 Well it is bad feelings do is I think out as I related videos 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.530
 I say so 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.310
 Oh dear 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.950
 Please say to this video Carnifty 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:03.840
 Because it is not a video I made 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.840
 Well I 'm sending cursive nifty car or something weird radio wave 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.680
 Oh dear 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.360
 Please think so already so let's go away just if I have that ability 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.170
 If it is enough to make a carnifty video ticket, the candidate is used for him in other places 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.010
 I want to 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.530
 If there is such an ability, if there is such an ability that can be moved with the power of curses such as No. 1 more 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.480
 Another place 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:34.239
 I would like to use it in a different place without letting her mother Nifty's video 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:40.989
 Well this is also a bit unreasonable, and I have made a video of a recent rally 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.890
 I will edit the sponsor name and put it, but there is Bill Star Academy that service Japan 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.310

 There is somewhere, so please inquire there . 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:19.729
 I am dealing with building sign shock 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.729
 Well I don't know if it's my responsibility 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.320
 Because there is such a company 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.500
 Please together poi 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.009
 that 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.819
 The other part is not cloudy 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:35.169
 It is not my typo not to be a pet r 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.080
 After level 5 what is 5 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.550
 I do not know it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.780
 If you look up on that wikipedia 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.689
 It was written that it is because it is a company that makes a five-star game 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:51.019
 Aside from this I'm going to show you in my related videos 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:56.899
 It's not my responsibility, I 'll come back to you 

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:58.189
 Whether Adler is an anchor ring Toka softening electromagnetic waves Toka kind of doubt not you in my 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:02.329
 There is 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:03.320
 It is often said in relation to something like amazon vine, but I do nothing 

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:06.150
 is not it 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:11.100
 Anchoring it video honest 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.690
 Well this even though I might would be told not a sincere attitude I kinda 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.260
 I can not understand 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:22.890
 Take a video of a car running away normally 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:29.790
 It is stalking the person who took the video 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:33.630
 Toka is monitoring which videos up main huge force came enormous pressure that ad monitoring suggested 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.630
 It is said that I am honestly what I think 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.930
 Please take a look at the Keep using this video link 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.729
 By the way, it seems to appear well as my related video 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.629
 I wonder if I'm doing technology crime 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.629
 It is said so 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.260
 I do not do it 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:06:00.860
 Anyway , technology crime that kind of thing is being done 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.860
 Anyway I would be a negative person, I'm never gone 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.740
 Well a little bit different 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:13.270
 I want to point out a little more constructive things but there Do not point out 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:20.400
 It allo Well 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:20.400
 It is what I described complaints Well, there is my video or more of 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:29.840
 There are things out of my reach beyond videos 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.840
 It feels like you please forgive me a bit 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.490
 Oh dear 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:44.150
 When this matter are drinking with his brother to say something but I was wondering what you try to kill 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:49.710
 I was told that it would be better to make something a little more fun 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:53.560
 Well I just talked to me normally because it's a bit uninteresting myself 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:57.569
 Well Tsu Please try a little show understanding 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:02.750
 Please understand the person who is watching my animation for a moment 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:07.210
 Well some people are already very much for everyone but 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.210
 It is more than I want to understand these things
