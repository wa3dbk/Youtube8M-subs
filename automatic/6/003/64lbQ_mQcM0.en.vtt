what to give you some guidelines on

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.480 
what to give you some guidelines on
evaluation<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:09.960> management<00:00:10.080> coding<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.400> if

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
evaluation and management coding so if

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.830 
evaluation and management coding so if
you'll<00:00:11.639> take<00:00:11.820> your<00:00:12.030> textbook<00:00:12.480> the

you'll take your textbook the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.230 
you'll take your textbook the
step-by-step<00:00:13.230> textbook<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.370> we're<00:00:14.940> looking

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
step-by-step textbook and we're looking

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.450 
step-by-step textbook and we're looking
in<00:00:15.360> chapter<00:00:15.780> 10<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.560> if<00:00:16.650> you'll<00:00:16.830> go<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> page

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
in chapter 10 so if you'll go to page

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.529 
in chapter 10 so if you'll go to page
280<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.800> on<00:00:19.800> page<00:00:20.130> 280<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
280 and on page 280 the first thing that

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
280 and on page 280 the first thing that
it<00:00:21.630> shows<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> three<00:00:22.830> factors

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it shows you here are the three factors

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.990 
it shows you here are the three factors
of<00:00:23.430> E&amp;M<00:00:24.029> coding<00:00:24.470> I<00:00:25.470> realized<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.340> E&amp;M<00:00:26.730> coding

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of E&amp;M coding I realized that E&amp;M coding

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720 
of E&amp;M coding I realized that E&amp;M coding
is<00:00:27.269> very<00:00:27.539> difficult<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:29.010> will<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> spend

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
is very difficult you will need to spend

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.420 
is very difficult you will need to spend
more<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.420> section<00:00:30.960> probably<00:00:31.920> than

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
more time on this section probably than

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
more time on this section probably than
any<00:00:32.640> other<00:00:32.880> sections<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.690> course<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
any other sections in this course you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.580 
any other sections in this course you
will<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.980> dealing<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.370> E&amp;M<00:00:35.880> coding<00:00:36.230> in<00:00:37.230> any

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
will be dealing with E&amp;M coding in any

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350 
will be dealing with E&amp;M coding in any
medical<00:00:38.280> field<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:38.730> anytime<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
medical field because anytime a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
medical field because anytime a
physician<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.050> involved<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.129> enm

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
physician is involved you will have enm

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
physician is involved you will have enm
codes<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:43.050> important<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
codes so it's very important that you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.150 
codes so it's very important that you
get<00:00:44.550> familiar<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.450> section<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> I'll

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
get familiar with this section and I'll

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.709 
get familiar with this section and I'll
know<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:48.539> are

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
know how to do these well they are

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.979 
know how to do these well they are
time-consuming<00:00:49.430> they<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.610> difficult<00:00:50.989> they

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
time-consuming they are difficult they

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
time-consuming they are difficult they
are<00:00:52.050> detailed<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> take

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
are detailed so you will need to take

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.080 
are detailed so you will need to take
your<00:00:54.660> time<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.379> doing<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> part<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.489> page

your time with doing this part on page

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
your time with doing this part on page
280<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.930> three<00:00:58.199> factors<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.920> enm<00:00:59.309> coding

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
280 the three factors of enm coding

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.299 
280 the three factors of enm coding
those<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.719> place<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.350> service<00:01:01.800> type<00:01:02.100> of
