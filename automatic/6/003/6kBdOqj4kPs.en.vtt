00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:09.160
 Piece seems Well today 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.640
 Before singing a song 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.970
 In the comments section of the video 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.110
 Please introduce the capitast you are using 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.310
 What 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.050
 Since I had a comment that say 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.810
 Today I think I will introduce you usually or walk 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.210
 So today 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.390
 The fluorescent light has been ticking and it has always been ticking 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.960
 Please do not two 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 I have only two cups I would like to introduce 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.670
 I heard began to is I was when of about twenty years old that you think all the way from that time 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.179
 This is it 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.410
 It is this open capo toast in the open mountain 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.880
 eh 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:01.670
 But I this I that falsification of the second generation 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:07.250
 I used the first color red, but this silver ton is rusty 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.090
 But I'm always getting a little white, but I saw that and I got broken 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.760
 The 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.860
 He looks two eyes this is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.370
 Where to go to Mother Nick 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.710
 I wonder if it will be used across 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.300
 It is cooking 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.300
 Hmm 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 Hmm 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.360
 It is a general inspection support a 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.600
 I have one more 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.409
 Recently all around 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.460
 I use it for videos, and this is what I usually use all the time 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.980
 It is written that ns pro 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.140
 ns or pop 2 amo 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.400
 I bought it on the net 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:58.190
 Because the rate of that net looks pretty good reputation 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:04.510
 I bought this This is a different kind of mushroom When it is different screw 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.510
 It will be in the past of the type to be fixed by tightening the cattle 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.550
 Middle j 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.819
 I will fix it by pulling out google and tightening. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 Four 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.640
 If it is 8 at the meeting, it is smooth 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.550
 Hm 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.300
 me 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.300
 me 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.840
 It is a 2 past that actually various types are already various types other than these two 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.099
 I have it, but when I actually play it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.990
 I think that I understand, but here is Higo at all by the past 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:43.940
 It's different . 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.230
 These two have always used it from before 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 a 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.040
 I'd have played relatively recently bought this 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.980
 If you pull, this is really easy to play 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.340
 Sense of holding that open string 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.190
 In 8 per this 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.220
 I can pull in two rows 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.220
 Oh 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.950
 me 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:17.840
 It is very easy to pull and the power of one's finger is not so strong 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:23.840
 A temple with a short finger is preferably as high as possible 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:31.980
 I feel I mean Na' is called can be suppressed with a small force, but this really 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:34.680
 It is easy to play Armor fixed all the way in this position, from the beginning to the end of the song 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.920
 And say, Hikiyo' 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.880
 It is Toka time of the song this is I'm such proceed traveling 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:48.819
 For example , when the key changes in the middle 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:53.830
 That 's right, there's a song that changes the tone at the end, but that's when that's the case 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:57.400
 You can fix this if you grab this capo and talk immediately 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:07.150
 a, for example, the last shop Kosha 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:08.760
 And conceded Toka pulled out this change prior to the pin than at the time of the song you want to last in the prefectural government 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.720
 Can be pulled 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.260
 It's like that 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.990
 For television 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:21.620
 Mr. Sakurai in 3 is good 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.840
 I think it's a fireworks or something, but when I sing fireworks I use this and before I get into the last savi 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.650
 To 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.040
 Shift by only this amount 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.540
 The in the last of the rust and said pulling have 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.200
 I think the actual Naa I'm also using a professional person Oh look on TV 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.500
 Oh 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.160
 I said 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 So in the middle of the song on the way to the zodiac 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.920
 Or changing the Pont-position look- 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.190
 Time is 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.780
 I think that I wonder if here of Kaparu sprouting recommended 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.620
 It is easy to play and compare variously 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.630
 After that 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:04.880
 It depends on the song you play 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:11.310
 I think that 8 capo will go back and I think that's good, so try variously by all means and play 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:13.900
 I think I should try to find something that suits you 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.290
 Today parked divided the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:22.620
 I tried to introduce my own capo 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:24.680
 The past is the recommended very personally 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.400
 Baby treats 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.639
 Because I am also playing and talking 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.780
 Oh, by all means 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.960
 I think it would be nice to hear that too 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.969
 Thank you for your registration 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.329
