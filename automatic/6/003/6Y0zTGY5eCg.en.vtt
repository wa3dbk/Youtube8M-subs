00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you know just to dr. peppers day 590

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
you know just to dr. peppers day 590
calories<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.120> not

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
calories just for that and that's not

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.049

including what you're eat so I found a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.780 
including what you're eat so I found a
good<00:01:03.210> alternative<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.320> uh<00:01:04.610> dr.<00:01:05.610> pepper

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
good alternative is these uh dr. pepper

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.030 
Kim's is they only have ten calories
that<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.930> limit<00:01:10.260> yourself<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.740> maybe

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that so if you limit yourself to maybe

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.850 
that so if you limit yourself to maybe

and now I when I got done doing that I

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.280 
and now I when I got done doing that I
was<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> lot<00:02:29.860> heavier<00:02:30.460> then<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.420> was<00:02:31.660> premature

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
was a lot heavier then I was premature

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:45.420 
was a lot heavier then I was premature
for<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.680> actually<00:02:32.980> lost<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:43.500> 500<00:02:44.500> calorie<00:02:45.070> diets

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
for I actually lost so 500 calorie diets

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.080 
for I actually lost so 500 calorie diets
are<00:02:45.580> really<00:02:46.540> really<00:02:47.500> good<00:02:47.740> quick<00:02:48.040> fix<00:02:48.400> but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
are really really good quick fix but

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.330 
are really really good quick fix but
they<00:02:49.300> are<00:02:49.540> never<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.960> solution<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.740> you're

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
they are never the solution if you're

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.810 
they are never the solution if you're
looking<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.120> stay<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.110> way<00:02:53.440> if<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.490> want<00:02:54.700> to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
looking to stay that way if you want to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.380 
looking to stay that way if you want to
get<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.240> way<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.350> guess<00:02:57.100> maybe<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.880> month

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
get that way for I guess maybe a month

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.880 
get that way for I guess maybe a month
or<00:02:58.720> two<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.280> problem<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:01.680> whenever<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
or two the problem is see whenever you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.250 
or two the problem is see whenever you
start<00:03:03.160> eating<00:03:03.400> normal<00:03:04.150> again<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.959> go<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
start eating normal again if you go to a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.190 
start eating normal again if you go to a
restaurant<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:05.830> something<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.959> eat

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
restaurant or something then you eat

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.500 
restaurant or something then you eat
like<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.590> used<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.920> eat<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.550> gain<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:10.120> two

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
like you used to eat you gain like two

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.630 
like you used to eat you gain like two
times<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.140> weight<00:03:11.320> which<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.010> would<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.370> if

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
times the weight which you would have if

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.090 
times the weight which you would have if
you<00:03:12.820> were<00:03:12.850> just<00:03:13.150> lost<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.770> little<00:03:14.950> bit

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
you were just lost so it is a little bit

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.330 
you were just lost so it is a little bit
more<00:03:15.340> harder<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:17.080> do<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.410> right<00:03:17.709> now<00:03:17.920> what<00:03:18.220> I'm

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
more harder to do it right now what I'm

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.030 
more harder to do it right now what I'm
doing<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.880> mean<00:03:19.060> 1,500<00:03:19.989> calories<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> day<00:03:20.620> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
doing is I mean 1,500 calories a day and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.740 
doing is I mean 1,500 calories a day and
I<00:03:21.880> think<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.239> completely<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:25.600> at

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
I think that's completely out I was at

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.300 
I think that's completely out I was at
3:30<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.530> now<00:03:27.060> 3:14<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.420> mean<00:03:29.230> about<00:03:29.470> 1,500

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
3:30 and now 3:14 I mean about 1,500

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.720 
3:30 and now 3:14 I mean about 1,500
calories<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> day<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:32.230> am<00:03:32.730> walking

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
calories a day and I am walking

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.520 
calories a day and I am walking
sometimes<00:03:34.510> from<00:03:35.140> 3<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.830> 4<00:03:36.100> hours<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:37.600> this<00:03:38.320> is

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
sometimes from 3 to 4 hours and this is

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.320 
sometimes from 3 to 4 hours and this is
going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.769> because<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.580> usually<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> real

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
going to because I usually have a real

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.820 
going to because I usually have a real
hard<00:03:40.570> time<00:03:40.660> with<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.140> scale<00:03:41.380> because<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
hard time with the scale because I

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.680 
hard time with the scale because I
really<00:03:42.100> like<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.400> keep<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:43.030> know<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.450> hard

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
really like to keep you know it's hard

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.540 
really like to keep you know it's hard
to<00:03:43.989> resist<00:03:44.080> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.709> if<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.010> just<00:03:45.220> take<00:03:45.489> a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
to resist going to it if you just take a

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.390 
to resist going to it if you just take a
walk<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.600> now<00:03:47.140> I've<00:03:47.380> kind<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.769> disciplined

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
walk so now I've kind of disciplined

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.180 
walk so now I've kind of disciplined
myself<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.810> scale<00:03:50.110> once<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.620> week<00:03:50.830> so<00:03:51.130> I
