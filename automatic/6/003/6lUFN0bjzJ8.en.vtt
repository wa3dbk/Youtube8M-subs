00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.450
 Hello everyone, Iâ€™ll try to portray it 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 does it mean clutch disc slave 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 from cummins diesel engine volume 28 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.730
 that's why my task is all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 the question that can be put on the ground 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.119
 write 1432 since work is equal 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.220
 That would be all the clutch is not satisfied 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.080
 nothing is clear that you fit 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 creeper in diameter around fit 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.230
 but he must have a damper 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.420
 the so -called idling in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.280
 There is no information anywhere on the Internet 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:49.140
 Found here and for certain managed to find out 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.960
 only empirically here's one person 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 advised how to check it 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:04.650
 primary roller box experience drive on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:08.540
 Slots choose the backlash and swing like 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.189
 you can see the roller stands still and the drive goes 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.830
 the damper spring is not compressed 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.650
 it means that here from 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.600
 idle damper and drive on 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.630
 diesel engine and how i actually 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 supposed to install can be here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.799
 so this is a diesel Kamenets disk we 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 We will put on ZMZ 514 30 was 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:47.070
 leave we together important and fallen schooling 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.740
 this atari is all so smooth 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.079
 so nice but so full 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.729
 backlash spinning tight felt that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.310
 He lubrication there is it such here 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.340
 the dress cuff is detached in principle 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.460
 the theory should be hives in mud logs 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.880
 protected and live serve long 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.390
 that's all this kit remains here 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.980
 such here 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.200
 basket and the same firm sax from the same 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.500
 of himself 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.510
 diesel wheel 28 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.920
 gazelevsky option and sports to whom 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:32.670
 it will go something like this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:38.100
 here's the way in theory everything should work 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.100
 here actually got thanks
