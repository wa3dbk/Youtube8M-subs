sake out is is weak as piss sometimes

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.090 
sake out is is weak as piss sometimes
but<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.119> how<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> use<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
but if you know how to use it it's so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.969 
but if you know how to use it it's so
good<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:45.119> why<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.479> close<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> ghosts<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
good that's why in close to the ghosts I

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
good that's why in close to the ghosts I
hope<00:01:47.220> shotguns<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.570> black<00:01:48.840> ops<00:01:49.049> 1

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
hope shotguns are like in black ops 1

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
hope shotguns are like in black ops 1
but<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.250> again<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.850> were<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
but then again they were kind of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.499 
but then again they were kind of
balanced<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.820> versus<00:01:53.820> certain<00:01:54.210> assault

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
balanced out versus certain assault

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.440 
balanced out versus certain assault
rifles<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> certain<00:01:55.350> SMGs<00:01:56.180> forget<00:01:57.180> about<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
rifles and certain SMGs forget about the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.709 
rifles and certain SMGs forget about the
LMG<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> only<00:01:58.200> girl<00:01:58.380> mg<00:01:58.829> were<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.909> m60

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
LMG the only girl mg were was the m60

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.920 
LMG the only girl mg were was the m60
really<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.290> maybe<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.829> stoner<00:02:02.780> rpk<00:02:03.780> was

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
really and maybe the stoner rpk was

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.700 
really and maybe the stoner rpk was
garbage<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> HK<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.189> kind<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> shitty<00:02:06.329> too

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
garbage in the HK was kind of shitty too

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.490 
garbage in the HK was kind of shitty too
so<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.610> we'll<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.450> saw<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> couple<00:02:10.319> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
so you know we'll see I saw a couple of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.400 
so you know we'll see I saw a couple of
shotguns<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.069> call<00:02:11.220> duty<00:02:11.430> ghosts

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
shotguns and call duty ghosts

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.220 
shotguns and call duty ghosts
they<00:02:12.650> look<00:02:12.800> cool<00:02:13.010> but<00:02:13.450> we'll<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.690> don't

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
they look cool but we'll see I don't

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.110 
they look cool but we'll see I don't
know<00:02:15.380> if<00:02:15.500> there's<00:02:15.680> only<00:02:15.830> two<00:02:16.100> there's<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.910> two

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
know if there's only two there's on two

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.280 
know if there's only two there's on two
shotguns<00:02:17.480> or<00:02:17.570> maybe<00:02:17.750> there<00:02:17.870> was<00:02:17.960> only<00:02:18.080> two

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
balanced enough and that you can use

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.700 
balanced enough and that you can use
them<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.120> not<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.870> know<00:02:26.930> freak<00:02:27.320> out<00:02:27.470> where

another<00:04:27.990> generic<00:04:28.530> call<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:28.980> duty<00:04:29.160> although<00:04:29.340> it

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
another generic call of duty although it

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.890 
another generic call of duty although it

looks like another genetic call of duty

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.900 
looks like another genetic call of duty
but<00:04:31.380> sometimes<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.070> has<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.400> spark<00:04:32.850> that

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
but sometimes it has that spark that

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.750 
but sometimes it has that spark that
that<00:04:33.330> forgotten<00:04:34.080> element<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:35.370> makes<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.640> all

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that forgotten element that makes it all

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.110 
that forgotten element that makes it all
