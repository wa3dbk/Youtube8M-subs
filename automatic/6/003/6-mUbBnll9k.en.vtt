experiment<00:00:38.280> showed<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.940> had<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
experiment showed that if you had a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.430 
experiment showed that if you had a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
a spark hit these they would call here a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
a spark hit these they would call here a

line on close to the circuit the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
line on close to the circuit the
coherent<00:00:50.399> became<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> basis<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.149> radio

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
coherent became the basis of radio

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.229 
coherent became the basis of radio

12<00:00:54.600> 15<00:00:55.050> years<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.520> go<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
12 15 years so here we go for the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.080 
12 15 years so here we go for the
experiment<00:00:58.010> generate<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> spark<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.489> here's<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
experiment generate a spark so here's a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
experiment generate a spark so here's a
gas<00:01:00.570> lighter<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:02.010> two<00:01:02.160> electrodes<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
gas lighter is the two electrodes and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
gas lighter is the two electrodes and
the<00:01:02.820> aerials<00:01:03.090> generators<00:01:03.480> back<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the aerials generators back and as you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
the aerials generators back and as you
can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.150> these<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:06.420> aligned<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
can see these have actually aligned and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.190 
can see these have actually aligned and
cones<00:01:08.040> passing<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.390> turn<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
cones passing now to turn it off it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
cones passing now to turn it off it
needed<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.010> known<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> knock-back

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
needed what was known as a knock-back

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
needed what was known as a knock-back
and<00:01:12.170> what's<00:01:13.170> happened<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.830> we've

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and what's happened there is that we've

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.940 
and what's happened there is that we've
decohere<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.299> iron<00:01:16.229> filings<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.799> now

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
decohere the iron filings have now

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.609 
decohere the iron filings have now
brought<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.549> circuit<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.119> again<00:01:18.390> click<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
brought in circuit so again click and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
brought in circuit so again click and
there<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.400> generate<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.840> electromagnetic

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
there we go generate an electromagnetic

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.219 
there we go generate an electromagnetic
wave<00:01:22.619> from<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> spark<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:24.270> made<00:01:24.540> particles

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
wave from the spark it's made particles

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.100 
wave from the spark it's made particles
align<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.159> circuit<00:01:26.549> closed<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> knock-back

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
align the circuit closed and knock-back

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
align the circuit closed and knock-back
now<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.650> model<00:01:28.950> yokes<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.119> used<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
now in model yokes and it was used to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.260 
now in model yokes and it was used to
control<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.840> airship<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:32.159> model<00:01:32.939> airship

an attractor and some other models as

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.039 
an attractor and some other models as
well<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.579> spectrum<00:01:39.390> limiters<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.869> very

well but the spectrum limiters are very

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.420 
well but the spectrum limiters are very
much<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.409> powerful<00:01:40.860> than<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.220> fact

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
much more powerful than this in fact

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.920 
much more powerful than this in fact
indeed<00:01:41.729> they're<00:01:41.939> illegal<00:01:42.329> today<00:01:42.600> because

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
indeed they're illegal today because

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.289 
indeed they're illegal today because
they<00:01:43.619> transmit<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.820> across<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> spectrum

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
they transmit all across the spectrum

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
they transmit all across the spectrum
and<00:01:45.750> cause<00:01:46.049> massive<00:01:46.409> problems<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and cause massive problems and this is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.819 
and cause massive problems and this is
very<00:01:48.390> low<00:01:48.570> powered<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> range<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.710> a
