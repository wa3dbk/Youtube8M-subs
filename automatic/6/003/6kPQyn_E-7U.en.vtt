00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820 

oh<00:00:04.819> hello<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.850> didn't<00:00:06.270> see<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.420> there<00:00:06.690> I'm<00:00:07.620> just

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
oh hello I didn't see you there I'm just

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.070 
oh hello I didn't see you there I'm just
experimenting<00:00:08.280> with<00:00:08.820> peptic<00:00:09.210> microbial<00:00:09.870> fuel

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
experimenting with peptic microbial fuel

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.709 
experimenting with peptic microbial fuel
cells<00:00:10.670> microbial<00:00:11.670> fuel<00:00:11.790> cells<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.240> basically

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
cells microbial fuel cells are basically

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.900 
cells microbial fuel cells are basically
an<00:00:12.870> alternative<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.650> battery<00:00:13.950> power<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
an alternative for battery power and the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.880 
an alternative for battery power and the
great<00:00:15.089> thing<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.680> power

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
great thing about that is that the power

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.920 
great thing about that is that the power
never<00:00:17.310> diminishes<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.180> continuous<00:00:18.720> power

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
never diminishes it's continuous power

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.370 
never diminishes it's continuous power
so<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.310> over<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.380> ocean

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so what I have over here is ocean

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.730 
so what I have over here is ocean
sediment<00:00:22.830> from<00:00:23.039> coastal<00:00:23.460> New<00:00:23.580> Jersey<00:00:24.439> this<00:00:25.439> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
sediment from coastal New Jersey this is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.769 
sediment from coastal New Jersey this is
the<00:00:26.039> benthic<00:00:26.430> layer<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> ocean<00:00:27.240> sediment

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the benthic layer of the ocean sediment

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
the benthic layer of the ocean sediment
which<00:00:27.869> means<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> top<00:00:28.710> layer<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
which means it's just the top layer of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.910 
which means it's just the top layer of
the<00:00:29.340> ocean<00:00:29.789> floor<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.140> put<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> sediment

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the ocean floor so we put the sediment

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.940 
the ocean floor so we put the sediment
into<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.340> beaker<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> added<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.960> sea<00:00:34.739> water

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
into this beaker and added on sea water

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330 
into this beaker and added on sea water
and<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.920> take<00:00:38.160> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and what I'm going to do is take this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
and what I'm going to do is take this
graphite<00:00:39.030> disk<00:00:39.450> anode<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:41.250> carbon

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
graphite disk anode and this carbon

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.139 
graphite disk anode and this carbon
fiber<00:00:41.820> cathode<00:00:43.040> I'm<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> submerge<00:00:44.789> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
fiber cathode I'm going to submerge this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680 
fiber cathode I'm going to submerge this
anode<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> sediment<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.420> I'm<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
anode into the sediment and I'm going to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.580 
anode into the sediment and I'm going to
place<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.039> path<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> sea<00:00:52.410> water

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
place the path out into the sea water

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.279 
place the path out into the sea water
and<00:00:53.090> after<00:00:54.090> hooking<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.870> wires<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and after hooking up all the wires and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
and after hooking up all the wires and
everything<00:00:55.530> what's<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> happen<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
everything what's going to happen is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
everything what's going to happen is
we're<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> monitor<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.500> voltage<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
we're going to monitor the voltage and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.209 
we're going to monitor the voltage and
current<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> computer<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> bacteria

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
current in the computer and the bacteria

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.000 
current in the computer and the bacteria
in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.879> sediment<00:01:03.359> oxidizes<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.350> organic

how<00:01:18.020> are<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.320> doing<00:01:18.680> hi<00:01:19.190> Betty<00:01:19.520> well<00:01:20.120> I<00:01:20.360> am

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
how are you doing hi Betty well I am

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.870 
how are you doing hi Betty well I am
standing<00:01:21.290> in<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.560> sewer<00:01:21.830> party<00:01:22.280> talking<00:01:22.760> to

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
standing in the sewer party talking to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.540 
standing in the sewer party talking to
you<00:01:23.090> hear<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.290> music<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.860> party<00:01:28.220> is<00:01:28.310> starting

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
you hear the music the party is starting

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
you hear the music the party is starting
to<00:01:28.880> die<00:01:29.060> down

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
to die down

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.300 
to die down
perhaps<00:01:30.410> we<00:01:30.680> should<00:01:30.710> spice<00:01:31.190> up<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.610> party

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
perhaps we should spice up the party

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.670 
perhaps we should spice up the party
spice<00:01:34.310> up<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.760> party<00:01:35.120> we<00:01:35.900> are<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.170> only<00:01:36.320> ones

need them to power up the disco ball how

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.090 
need them to power up the disco ball how
are<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.450> going<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.840> do<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.020> when<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.890> fish

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
are we going to do that when the fish

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.820 
are we going to do that when the fish
