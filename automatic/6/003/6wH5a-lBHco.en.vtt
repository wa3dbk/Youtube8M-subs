00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it for as long as the dancer can hold

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.680 
it for as long as the dancer can hold
the<00:01:45.090> pose<00:01:46.220> sometimes<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.730> is<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.630> need

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
the pose sometimes what I do is I need

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.920 
the pose sometimes what I do is I need
to<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.650> locations<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.970> wouldn't<00:01:51.780> allow

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
to go into locations that wouldn't allow

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
to go into locations that wouldn't allow
me<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.440> do<00:01:52.620> that<00:01:52.800> but<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.160> want<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
me to do that but I want to get the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.790 
me to do that but I want to get the
photograph<00:01:54.300> because<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.410> be<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> really

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
photograph because it would be a really

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.270 
photograph because it would be a really
cool<00:01:56.040> shot<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.540> Apple<00:01:57.870> store<00:01:58.160> when<00:01:59.160> we

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
cool shot so the Apple store when we

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.900 
cool shot so the Apple store when we
shot<00:01:59.490> there<00:01:59.730> I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.440> got<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.620> good<00:02:01.910> 45

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
shot there I think we got a good 45

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.850 
shot there I think we got a good 45
seconds<00:02:03.360> before<00:02:03.510> they<00:02:03.780> came<00:02:03.960> over<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.740> know

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
seconds before they came over you know

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.170 
seconds before they came over you know
and<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.160> all<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.490> needed<00:02:05.910> because

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
and that's all we really needed because

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.060 
and that's all we really needed because
Tennille<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> dancer<00:02:07.440> really<00:02:07.650> couldn't<00:02:07.920> hold

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
Tennille the dancer really couldn't hold

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.520 
Tennille the dancer really couldn't hold
a<00:02:08.340> split<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.330> from<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:09.780> 45<00:02:10.200> seconds

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
a split like that from one 45 seconds

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.440 
a split like that from one 45 seconds
anyway<00:02:10.800> because<00:02:11.010> I<00:02:11.190> found<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:12.150> often

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
anyway because I found that more often

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.850
