the very end we're gonna sneak back for

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.509 
the very end we're gonna sneak back for
that<00:02:49.730> last<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.239> transition<00:02:50.959> chord<00:02:51.290> back<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
that last a transition chord back to the

that last a transition chord back to the
B<00:02:52.639> minor<00:02:52.909> 7<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.629> repeats<00:03:00.909> alright<00:03:01.909> now

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
B minor 7 and that repeats alright now

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:14.339 
B minor 7 and that repeats alright now
let's<00:03:02.780> talk<00:03:02.810> rhythm

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.929 

so<00:03:15.349> that<00:03:15.530> same<00:03:15.769> pattern<00:03:16.189> repeats<00:03:16.549> for<00:03:16.790> each

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
so that same pattern repeats for each

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.089 
so that same pattern repeats for each
chord<00:03:17.299> for<00:03:17.480> each<00:03:17.599> measure<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.620> pattern

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
chord for each measure and that pattern

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:27.589 
chord for each measure and that pattern
is

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:54.450 

1<00:03:28.599> 2<00:03:29.140> 3<00:03:29.500> 4<00:03:30.250> M<00:03:30.549> 1<00:03:30.849> &amp;<00:03:31.060> 2<00:03:31.359> &amp;<00:03:31.659> 3<00:03:31.780> go<00:03:32.469> 1<00:03:32.799> 2<00:03:33.579> 3<00:03:33.609> 4<00:03:34.480> M<00:03:34.959> &amp;<00:03:35.530> 2<00:03:35.799> 3

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.790 

what<00:03:55.460> three<00:03:56.240> four<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.780> one<00:03:57.020> two<00:03:57.200> three<00:03:57.560> four

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
what three four and one two three four

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:09.510 
what three four and one two three four
three<00:04:00.800> four

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.180 

so<00:04:10.520> basically<00:04:10.850> what<00:04:11.180> we<00:04:11.270> have<00:04:11.300> is<00:04:11.480> a

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
so basically what we have is a

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.580 
so basically what we have is a
syncopated<00:04:13.750> toggling<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.080> hands<00:04:15.440> we're

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
syncopated toggling of the hands we're

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.050 
syncopated toggling of the hands we're
gonna<00:04:15.710> switch<00:04:16.070> back<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.310> forth<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.970> a

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
gonna switch back and forth in a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.210 
gonna switch back and forth in a
syncopated<00:04:17.510> way<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.500> with<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.799> first<00:04:19.010> chord

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
syncopated way so with that first chord

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.420 
syncopated way so with that first chord
we're<00:04:19.310> gonna<00:04:19.400> go<00:04:19.609> one<00:04:20.269> two<00:04:20.570> three<00:04:21.170> four<00:04:22.130> and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
we're gonna go one two three four and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:37.090 
we're gonna go one two three four and
one<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.150> two<00:04:23.270> three<00:04:35.110> right<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.320> if<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:36.950> keep

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
one and two three right and if you keep

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.470 
one and two three right and if you keep
the<00:04:37.190> pedal<00:04:37.400> down<00:04:37.520> through<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.240> won't<00:04:38.390> be

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
the pedal down through that it won't be

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480 
the pedal down through that it won't be
so<00:04:38.660> choppy<00:04:38.960> but<00:04:39.590> I'm<00:04:39.740> playing<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.130> choppy<00:04:40.370> on

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
so choppy but I'm playing it choppy on

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.280 
so choppy but I'm playing it choppy on
purpose<00:04:40.910> now<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.300> can<00:04:41.420> hear<00:04:41.630> each<00:04:41.810> section

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
purpose now so you can hear each section

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.790 
purpose now so you can hear each section
each<00:04:42.560> hand<00:04:43.070> different<00:04:43.850> part<00:04:44.560> all<00:04:45.560> right<00:04:45.620> so

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
each hand different part all right so

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.260 
each hand different part all right so
when<00:04:45.920> we<00:04:46.010> put<00:04:46.160> that<00:04:46.280> all<00:04:46.400> together<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.940> little

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
when we put that all together a little

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:58.800 
when we put that all together a little
slowly<00:04:47.540> it's<00:04:48.320> gonna<00:04:48.410> sound<00:04:48.590> like<00:04:48.710> this

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
