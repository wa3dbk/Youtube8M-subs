barrel is here at the bottom now what

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.920 
barrel is here at the bottom now what
that<00:00:44.430> does<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> keeps<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.420> hand<00:00:45.719> your

unlike a standard revolver where you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.560 
unlike a standard revolver where you
pull<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> trigger<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> hammer<00:01:03.149> cocks

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
back and then fires or you do what I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.820 
back and then fires or you do what I
just<00:01:05.939> did<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.240> cock<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> back<00:01:07.110> manually<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
just did there cock it back manually and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.380 
just did there cock it back manually and
fire<00:01:08.189> each<00:01:08.400> time<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.850> double<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.270> single

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
fire each time so double and single

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.149 
fire each time so double and single
action<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.619> uses<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> extra

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
action this actually uses the extra

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.410 
action this actually uses the extra
energy<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.520> firing<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> shells<00:01:12.150> into

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
energy from firing the shells into

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
energy from firing the shells into
cocking<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> hammer<00:01:13.110> back<00:01:13.770> each<00:01:14.130> time<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
cocking the hammer back each time so it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
cocking the hammer back each time so it
becomes<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.530> semi-automatic<00:01:16.530> revolver<00:01:17.400> which

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
becomes a semi-automatic revolver which

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.910 
becomes a semi-automatic revolver which
was<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:18.060> unique<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> those<00:01:19.170> super

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
because it is so long and this is real

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.030 
because it is so long and this is real
wood<00:04:01.900> there's<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.410> little<00:04:02.560> screw<00:04:02.829> right<00:04:02.860> here

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
wood there's a little screw right here

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.410 
wood there's a little screw right here
you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.489> back<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:03.850> screw<00:04:04.060> out<00:04:04.150> take

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
you can just back that screw out take

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.910 
you can just back that screw out take

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
the whole grip off and then fill it no

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.990 
the whole grip off and then fill it no
problem<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.400> not<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.640> big<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.880> deal

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
problem it's not that big of a deal

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.610 
problem it's not that big of a deal
because<00:04:07.329> you<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.660> get<00:04:07.810> actually<00:04:08.019> quite<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.440> few

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
because you can get actually quite a few

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.319 
because you can get actually quite a few
shots<00:04:08.860> out<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.280> single<00:04:09.489> grip<00:04:09.790> fill<00:04:09.970> because

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
shots out of a single grip fill because

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.360 
shots out of a single grip fill because
of<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.510> reservoir<00:04:11.049> fills<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.070> entire

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
of the reservoir fills up this entire

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.850 
of the reservoir fills up this entire
grip<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.480> with<00:04:13.600> only<00:04:13.720> six<00:04:13.870> shots<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.739> can

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
grip and with only six shots you can

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.500 
grip and with only six shots you can
probably<00:04:15.010> go<00:04:15.160> through<00:04:15.370> about<00:04:15.549> 18<00:04:16.090> or<00:04:16.359> maybe

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
probably go through about 18 or maybe

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.069 
probably go through about 18 or maybe
even<00:04:16.570> 24<00:04:17.229> shots<00:04:17.500> before<00:04:17.859> having<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.549> refill

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
even 24 shots before having to refill

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.300 
even 24 shots before having to refill
actions<00:04:20.079> like<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.320> described<00:04:20.709> earlier<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.160> can

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
actions like I described earlier you can

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.860 
actions like I described earlier you can
either<00:04:21.580> pull<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> trigger<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.630> fires

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
either pull the trigger and it fires

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.480 
either pull the trigger and it fires
it's<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.200> really<00:04:23.590> stiff<00:04:23.830> trigger<00:04:24.070> pull<00:04:24.310> really

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
made pistol because they obviously have

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.650 
made pistol because they obviously have
lower<00:04:59.190> FPS<00:04:59.790> requirements<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.450> they're<00:05:00.570> not

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
lower FPS requirements and they're not

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.820 
lower FPS requirements and they're not
really<00:05:00.870> building<00:05:01.080> these<00:05:01.290> pistols<00:05:01.650> for

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
outside of that market and of course

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.500 
outside of that market and of course
like<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.480> said<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.780> get<00:05:03.870> about<00:05:04.020> 24<00:05:04.950> 25<00:05:05.430> 27<00:05:06.150> shots

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
before having to refill so it is

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.670 
before having to refill so it is
actually<00:05:09.300> pretty<00:05:09.540> efficient<00:05:09.960> on<00:05:10.020> gas<00:05:10.230> even

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
though the lower FPS accuracy is also

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.270

really<00:05:51.330> think<00:05:51.539> this<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.810> collector's<00:05:52.200> piece

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
really think this is a collector's piece

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.170 
really think this is a collector's piece
because<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.010> lower<00:05:53.160> FPS<00:05:53.610> because<00:05:53.820> of<00:05:54.090> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
because of the lower FPS because of the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.060 
because of the lower FPS because of the
shell<00:05:54.390> loading<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:54.900> all<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.169> it<00:05:55.350> is<00:05:55.410> super

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
shell loading and all that it is super

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.860 
shell loading and all that it is super
cool<00:05:56.370> but<00:05:56.970> this<00:05:57.120> isn't<00:05:57.450> something<00:05:57.660> that's

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
cool but this isn't something that's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.300 
cool but this isn't something that's
