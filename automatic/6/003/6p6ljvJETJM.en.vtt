because I didn't title it is like

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.269 
because I didn't title it is like
time-saving<00:00:26.580> devices<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:28.160> devices<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
time-saving devices and devices that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.139

off this is a trap for a super hostile

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.439 
off this is a trap for a super hostile
map<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> pocket<00:00:52.140> hostilities<00:00:52.620> map<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.449> so

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
map or a pocket hostilities map and so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.170 
map or a pocket hostilities map and so
what<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> show<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> before<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
what I'm going to show you before I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
what I'm going to show you before I
actually<00:00:57.539> activate<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> circuit

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
actually activate it is the circuit

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.049 
actually activate it is the circuit
itself<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.059> marked

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
itself so as you can see I have marked

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.810 
itself so as you can see I have marked
all<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.100> different<00:01:05.100> types<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.460> liquids

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
all of the different types of liquids

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
all of the different types of liquids
with<00:01:06.450> different<00:01:07.140> types<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.380> wool<00:01:07.790> lava<00:01:08.790> red

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
with different types of wool lava red

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.550 
with different types of wool lava red
water<00:01:09.840> blue<00:01:10.640> when<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> goes<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.330> here

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
water blue when it goes all it over here

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
water blue when it goes all it over here
so<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:15.170> at<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:16.860> beginning<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:18.290> love

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so you have at the very beginning a love

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
so you have at the very beginning a love
a<00:01:19.560> block<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.130> stationary<00:01:20.640> connect<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> do

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a block that is stationary connect to do

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
a block that is stationary connect to do
a<00:01:21.180> furnace<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.710> flow<00:01:22.920> under<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a furnace and it will flow under this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
a furnace and it will flow under this
water<00:01:23.580> block<00:01:24.080> certified<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.409> below<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
water block certified right below the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.960 
water block certified right below the
water<00:01:26.400> block<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:27.479> will<00:01:27.630> connect<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> this

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
water block which will connect to this

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
water block which will connect to this
flowing<00:01:29.970> lava<00:01:30.380> solidify<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.520> will

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
flowing lava solidify that and that will

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
flowing lava solidify that and that will
then<00:01:32.820> flow<00:01:33.150> under<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.509> water<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.829> some

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
then flow under this water and for some

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.100 
then flow under this water and for some
reason<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.610> doesn't<00:01:35.970> turn<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> cobble<00:01:36.869> stone

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
reason it doesn't turn to cobble stone

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.960 
reason it doesn't turn to cobble stone
but<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> water<00:01:38.369> flows<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.060> anyways<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.970> don't

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but the water flows out anyways I don't

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.429 
but the water flows out anyways I don't
quite<00:01:42.299> understand<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.320> I'll

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
quite understand and then then I'll

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.460 
quite understand and then then I'll
solidify<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.829> into<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:44.939> cobblestone<00:01:45.470> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
solidify this into more cobblestone it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
solidify this into more cobblestone it
will<00:01:46.590> flow<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:46.920> each<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.689> do<00:01:48.689> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
will flow into each other and do what

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.130 
will flow into each other and do what
they<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.200> intended<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:50.750> now<00:01:51.750> you've<00:01:51.960> seen

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
they are intended to do now you've seen

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.330 
they are intended to do now you've seen
this<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:55.470> much<00:01:55.619> probably

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this and you pretty much probably

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.870 
this and you pretty much probably
understand<00:01:57.229> what<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> does<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
understand what it does I'm going to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.200 
understand what it does I'm going to
mine<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.810> iron<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.009> actually<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
mine this iron which is actually the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.490 
mine this iron which is actually the
basis<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> trap<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.140> iron<00:02:07.250> more<00:02:08.250> iron<00:02:09.500> even

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
basis of the trap so iron more iron even

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
basis of the trap so iron more iron even
more<00:02:10.679> iron<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.190> probably<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.150> an

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
more iron I probably have it like an

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.730 
more iron I probably have it like an
iron<00:02:12.510> deposit

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
iron deposit

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.900 
iron deposit
instead<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> walkway<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.760> that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
instead of just like a walkway like that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.280 
instead of just like a walkway like that
but<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.630> would<00:02:15.720> dig<00:02:15.870> into<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.140> room

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
but then you would dig into this room

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.330 
but then you would dig into this room
these<00:02:16.530> will<00:02:16.650> also<00:02:16.830> prove<00:02:16.950> me<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
these will also prove me out of the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.220 
these will also prove me out of the
bedrock<00:02:17.760> by<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.000> way<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:19.020> that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
bedrock by the way just because that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.890 
bedrock by the way just because that
makes<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.710> trap<00:02:19.860> easier<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
makes the trap easier and here on the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
makes the trap easier and here on the
floor<00:02:22.110> when<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.500> torches<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.980> would<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
floor when it's torches I would have a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.750 
floor when it's torches I would have a
sign<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.520> says<00:02:23.850> here<00:02:24.630> make<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> few<00:02:25.260> swords

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
sign that says here make a few swords

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.210 
sign that says here make a few swords
you're<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.270> need<00:02:27.300> them<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:29.040> when

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you're going to need them and so when

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.400 
you're going to need them and so when
you<00:02:29.340> put<00:02:29.580> your<00:02:29.640> coal<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.990> mind<00:02:31.140> from<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
you put your coal do you mind from the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.660 
you put your coal do you mind from the
back<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:32.010> not<00:02:32.100> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> mine<00:02:32.460> from<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
back I'm just not going to mine from the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.650 
back I'm just not going to mine from the
back<00:02:32.730> cuz<00:02:32.940> there's<00:02:33.060> nothing<00:02:33.270> behind<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.510> right

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
back cuz there's nothing behind it right

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.170 
back cuz there's nothing behind it right
now<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.960> then<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.710> put<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.040> your<00:02:35.370> iron

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
now and then you put it in your iron

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.080 
now and then you put it in your iron
that<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.360> might<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.630> put<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that you might on put some of it and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.630 
that you might on put some of it and
then<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.420> mine<00:02:40.080> up<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.350> stuff<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.550> you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
then you mine up this stuff so that you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.880 
then you mine up this stuff so that you
can<00:02:41.820> make<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.360> sticks<00:02:43.230> later<00:02:44.100> probably

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
can make like sticks later probably

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.340 
can make like sticks later probably
because<00:02:46.890> come<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.730> wood<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.780> always<00:02:48.960> nice<00:02:49.320> to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
because come on wood it's always nice to

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.370 
because come on wood it's always nice to
have<00:02:49.550> even<00:02:50.550> if<00:02:50.700> even<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.840> don't<00:02:51.990> plan<00:02:52.050> on

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
have even if even if you don't plan on

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.250 
have even if even if you don't plan on
making<00:02:52.770> sticks<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:53.970> using<00:02:54.300> these<00:02:54.450> at<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:54.990> in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
making sticks or using these at all in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.620 
making sticks or using these at all in
your<00:02:56.060> swords<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.870> one<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.630> then

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
your swords and this one and then

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.130 
your swords and this one and then
there's<00:03:00.810> lava<00:03:00.990> pouring<00:03:01.410> into<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.860> room<00:03:02.130> and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
there's lava pouring into the room and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.380 
there's lava pouring into the room and
obviously<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.400> something<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.210> want

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
obviously that is not something you want

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.300 
obviously that is not something you want
in<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.870> room<00:03:07.080> made<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.410> bedrock<00:03:07.770> which<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.190> what

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
in a room made of bedrock which is what

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.500 
in a room made of bedrock which is what
this<00:03:08.400> would<00:03:08.610> be<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.270> summer<00:03:09.480> break

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
this would be but it's summer break

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.550 
this would be but it's summer break
because<00:03:09.720> I'm<00:03:09.840> ex<00:03:09.960> don't<00:03:10.140> break<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:13.440> was

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
because I'm ex don't break so it was

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.960 
because I'm ex don't break so it was
pretty<00:03:13.680> much<00:03:13.860> with<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> trap<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.670> mean

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
pretty much with the trap is I mean

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.970 
pretty much with the trap is I mean
you'll<00:03:15.210> get<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.600> iron<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.940> no<00:03:17.940> way<00:03:18.060> out

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
you'll get the iron but no way out

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.770 
you'll get the iron but no way out
unless<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.310> course<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:21.210> have<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.390> fly<00:03:21.570> mod

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
unless of course you have the fly mod

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.350 
unless of course you have the fly mod
which<00:03:21.990> I<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.560> which<00:03:22.710> case<00:03:22.980> i<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:24.150> just

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
which I have in which case i can just

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.010 
which I have in which case i can just
walk<00:03:25.050> through<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:26.160> love<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.540> even<00:03:27.810> pour<00:03:27.960> it

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
walk through the love and even pour it

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.560 
walk through the love and even pour it
on<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> side<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.890> anything<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.240> had<00:03:30.420> out

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
on the side so anything that you had out

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.450 
on the side so anything that you had out
there<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:31.200> that's<00:03:31.590> made<00:03:31.740> of<00:03:31.860> wood<00:03:32.010> will<00:03:32.220> burn

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
there like that's made of wood will burn

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.640 
there like that's made of wood will burn
and<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.710> not<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.250> fun<00:03:35.490> time<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.650> so

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and it's just not a fun time and so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.110 
and it's just not a fun time and so
here's<00:03:37.890> what<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.190> looks<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.520> after<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
here's what it looks like after the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.630 
here's what it looks like after the
activation<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.780> started<00:03:43.230> flowing<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:44.400> is

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
activation this started flowing this is

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.450 
activation this started flowing this is
lit<00:03:44.820> by<00:03:44.850> there<00:03:45.210> just<00:03:45.750> left<00:03:45.960> by<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.460> flowed

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
lit by there just left by this flowed

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.020 
lit by there just left by this flowed
under<00:03:47.660> some<00:03:48.660> reason<00:03:49.020> doesn't<00:03:49.890> turn<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
under some reason doesn't turn the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.260 
under some reason doesn't turn the
cobblestone<00:03:52.640> stand-in<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:53.760> still<00:03:54.030> lava

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
cobblestone stand-in it's still lava

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.270 
cobblestone stand-in it's still lava
this<00:03:54.990> flows<00:03:55.200> anyways<00:03:55.530> though<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.950> how's<00:03:56.100> that

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
this flows anyways though so how's that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.910 
this flows anyways though so how's that
this<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.960> and<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:59.370> lava<00:03:59.910> pours<00:04:00.540> down<00:04:00.920> into

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
this that and the lava pours down into

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.620 
this that and the lava pours down into
the<00:04:02.040> time<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.100> that's<00:04:05.790> about<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.060> guys<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.570> hope

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
the time so that's about it guys I hope

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.780 
the time so that's about it guys I hope
you<00:04:07.610> think<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.850> pretty<00:04:09.030> cool<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.660> was<00:04:09.870> a

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
you think this is pretty cool this was a

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.420 
you think this is pretty cool this was a
pretty<00:04:11.790> fun<00:04:12.150> thing<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.510> me<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.780> build<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.430> it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
pretty fun thing for me to build and it

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.970 
pretty fun thing for me to build and it
will<00:04:15.209> probably<00:04:15.600> cause<00:04:16.020> a<00:04:16.049> lot<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.410> pain<00:04:16.739> in

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
will probably cause a lot of pain in

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.539 
will probably cause a lot of pain in
some<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.760> 02<00:04:18.330> 03<00:04:18.480> epes<00:04:19.220> he<00:04:20.220> does<00:04:20.370> pocket

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
some of 02 03 epes he does pocket

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.010 
some of 02 03 epes he does pocket
hostilities<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.330> think<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.630> said<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.900> already

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
hostilities I think I said that already

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.219 
hostilities I think I said that already
but<00:04:22.560> he<00:04:23.040> does<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:24.360> they're<00:04:24.870> really<00:04:25.080> good

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
but he does and it's they're really good

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.030 
but he does and it's they're really good
you<00:04:25.740> should<00:04:25.919> go<00:04:25.979> check<00:04:26.130> him<00:04:26.220> out

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
you should go check him out
