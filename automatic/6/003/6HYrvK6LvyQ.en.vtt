00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
temperature of the tech stable you can

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.309 
temperature of the tech stable you can
see<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.120> water<00:02:13.330> levels<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> little<00:02:13.870> low<00:02:14.110> in

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.540 
see the water levels a little low in
here<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.040> want<00:02:15.129> to<00:02:15.250> keep<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> water

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
here but you want to keep the water

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.020 
here but you want to keep the water
level<00:02:15.700> above<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.120> heater<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.849> heater

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
everybody a front shot of the tank so

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.789 
everybody a front shot of the tank so
this<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.670> week<00:03:21.970> two<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.329> good<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:26.470> Saints

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
this is week two is that good the Saints

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.789 
this is week two is that good the Saints
now<00:03:26.920> suppose<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:27.310> out<00:03:27.459> mm-hmm<00:03:28.000> all<00:03:28.470> right<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.739> I

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
now suppose it out mm-hmm all right so I

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.369 
now suppose it out mm-hmm all right so I
guess<00:03:29.949> the<00:03:30.069> next<00:03:30.250> step<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:31.199> we're<00:03:32.199> going<00:03:32.319> to

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
guess the next step is we're going to

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.289 
guess the next step is we're going to
check<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.980> water<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.519> pick<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.209> two<00:03:35.019> corals

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
