00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
oil filter and oil filter adapter and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.770 
oil filter and oil filter adapter and
we're<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> swap<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.160> over<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> 3.4

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
we're going to swap that over to the 3.4

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.680 
we're going to swap that over to the 3.4
engine<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.040> first<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.700> all<00:00:14.849> let's<00:00:15.090> go<00:00:15.599> ahead

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
engine so first of all let's go ahead

and remove the filter and to do that if
you<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.789> Kane<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.750> leave<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
you have Kane and it's a leave it's a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.880 
you have Kane and it's a leave it's a
one<00:00:23.100> inch<00:00:23.420> socket<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.869> pull<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> off<00:00:25.289> but

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
one inch socket and pull that off but

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.689 
one inch socket and pull that off but
sometimes<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:27.180> muscling<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:29.430> if<00:00:29.519> your

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
sometimes just muscling it now if your

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
sometimes just muscling it now if your
engine<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:29.939> been<00:00:30.090> run<00:00:31.009> it's<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.250> like

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
engine has been run it's just like

going to get oil coming out as soon as
the<00:00:37.379> filter<00:00:37.710> comes<00:00:37.949> out<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.519> make<00:00:38.670> sure<00:00:38.699> you

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
the filter comes out just make sure you

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.899 
the filter comes out just make sure you
have<00:00:38.940> an<00:00:38.999> oil<00:00:39.179> pan<00:00:39.420> below<00:00:40.519> all<00:00:41.519> rights<00:00:41.639> now

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909 
have an oil pan below all rights now

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.919 
have an oil pan below all rights now
we're<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.179> to<00:00:42.299> remove<00:00:43.819> the<00:00:44.819> bolt<00:00:45.690> right

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
we're going to remove the bolt right

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.599 
we're going to remove the bolt right
here<00:00:46.999> next<00:00:47.999> to<00:00:48.209> the<00:00:48.600> oil<00:00:48.929> pressure<00:00:49.609> sending

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
here next to the oil pressure sending

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.739 
here next to the oil pressure sending
unit<00:00:51.829> there's<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:54.179> I<00:00:54.420> believe

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
unit there's actually two one I believe

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.779 
unit there's actually two one I believe
that<00:00:54.899> holds<00:00:55.109> little<00:00:55.799> pressure<00:00:56.190> sending<00:00:56.639> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that holds little pressure sending you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.049 
that holds little pressure sending you
in<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:56.969> bracket<00:00:57.389> on<00:00:57.539> which<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.409> get<00:00:58.529> that<00:00:58.739> out

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
in and bracket on which you get that out

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
in and bracket on which you get that out
there's<00:01:00.059> another<00:01:00.269> one<00:01:00.479> behind<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.769> go

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
there's another one behind it so go

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.300 
there's another one behind it so go
ahead<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.839> start<00:01:03.839> loosening<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:10.310> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
ahead and start loosening that up so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
ahead and start loosening that up so
there<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.579> have<00:01:11.609> that<00:01:11.990> alright<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.320> we're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
there we have that alright so now we're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.050 
there we have that alright so now we're
going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.829> use<00:01:14.039> a<00:01:14.990> 15<00:01:15.990> millimeter<00:01:16.439> deep<00:01:17.429> socket

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
going to use a 15 millimeter deep socket

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.440 
going to use a 15 millimeter deep socket
and<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.540> careful<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.180> oil<00:01:24.180> pressure

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and be careful with the oil pressure

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.860 
and be careful with the oil pressure
sending<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:26.060> over<00:01:27.060> stranger<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.660> bend

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
sending two that's over stranger to bend

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.290 
sending two that's over stranger to bend
it<00:01:30.350> don't<00:01:31.350> feel<00:01:31.530> comfortable<00:01:31.890> I'd<00:01:32.190> remove<00:01:32.550> the

it don't feel comfortable I'd remove the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.880 
it don't feel comfortable I'd remove the
oil<00:01:33.330> pressure<00:01:33.840> sending<00:01:34.350> unit<00:01:34.410> first<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:36.890> work

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
oil pressure sending unit first but work

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
oil pressure sending unit first but work
around<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:39.120> that<00:01:39.300> too<00:01:44.960> I've<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.350> loose

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.199 
and there we have it and all we needed
was<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:12.140> quarter<00:03:13.140> inch<00:03:13.260> wrench<00:03:14.030> all<00:03:15.030> right

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
was just a quarter inch wrench all right

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.250 
was just a quarter inch wrench all right
so<00:03:15.540> now<00:03:15.690> we've<00:03:15.870> got<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.319> bolt<00:03:16.950> removed<00:03:17.430> from

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
so now we've got the bolt removed from

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.620 
so now we've got the bolt removed from
the<00:03:19.260> engine<00:03:19.890> we're<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.640> install<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the engine we're going to install the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.880 
the engine we're going to install the
fiero<00:03:22.620> oil<00:03:23.340> pressure<00:03:23.670> sending<00:03:24.180> unit<00:03:24.739> now<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
fiero oil pressure sending unit now it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.300 
fiero oil pressure sending unit now it
actually<00:03:26.040> doesn't<00:03:27.020> thread<00:03:28.020> up<00:03:28.230> exactly<00:03:29.069> right

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
actually doesn't thread up exactly right

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.970 
actually doesn't thread up exactly right
it's<00:03:29.700> close<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.050> actually<00:03:31.440> will<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:31.830> an

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
it's close but we actually will need an

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.839 
it's close but we actually will need an
adapter<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.569> get<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:35.220> adapter

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
adapter and you can get this adapter

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.680 
adapter and you can get this adapter
