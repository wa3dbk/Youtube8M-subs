00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
so the rode smartlav here's what you get

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.640 
so the rode smartlav here's what you get
for<00:00:47.770> $60<00:00:48.520> you<00:00:48.760> get<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.450> mic<00:00:49.660> with<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:49.990> trrs

for $60 you get the mic with a trrs

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.600 
for $60 you get the mic with a trrs
connector<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:52.300> is<00:00:52.420> specially<00:00:52.930> wired<00:00:53.230> for

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
connector it is specially wired for

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.890 
connector it is specially wired for
compatibility<00:00:54.610> with<00:00:54.850> iPhones<00:00:55.330> and<00:00:55.630> most

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
compatibility with iPhones and most

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.410 
compatibility with iPhones and most
Android<00:00:56.440> devices<00:00:56.940> including<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:57.970> Galaxy

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
Android devices including the Galaxy

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.870 
Android devices including the Galaxy
Note<00:00:58.540> 3<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.810> probably<00:00:59.620> most<00:00:59.830> Samsung<00:01:00.489> Galaxy

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
Note 3 and probably most Samsung Galaxy

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.330 
Note 3 and probably most Samsung Galaxy
phones<00:01:01.150> that<00:01:02.080> is<00:01:02.230> important<00:01:02.739> because<00:01:02.830> Samsung

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
phones that is important because Samsung

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.910 
phones that is important because Samsung
Galaxy<00:01:03.670> phones<00:01:03.910> have<00:01:04.180> proprietary<00:01:04.920> wiring

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
Galaxy phones have proprietary wiring

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.160 
Galaxy phones have proprietary wiring
which<00:01:06.490> makes<00:01:06.729> it<00:01:06.910> not<00:01:07.090> compatible<00:01:07.479> with<00:01:07.750> any

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
which makes it not compatible with any

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.910 
which makes it not compatible with any
standard<00:01:08.770> microphone<00:01:09.130> without<00:01:09.670> an<00:01:09.850> adapter

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
standard microphone without an adapter

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.250 
standard microphone without an adapter
so<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:12.040> comes<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.400> this<00:01:12.460> box<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.900> get<00:01:14.110> this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
so it comes in this box so you get this

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.680 
so it comes in this box so you get this
leather<00:01:14.590> pouch<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:15.430> clip<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> high

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
leather pouch and this clip it is a high

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
quality clip that is mostly metal and it

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.290 
quality clip that is mostly metal and it
feels<00:01:19.690> very<00:01:20.020> durable<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:21.430> also<00:01:21.670> comes<00:01:22.060> with<00:01:22.180> a

feels very durable it also comes with a

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.090 
feels very durable it also comes with a
QuickStart<00:01:22.930> guide<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.470> shows<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.710> how<00:01:24.040> to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
QuickStart guide that shows you how to

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.430 
QuickStart guide that shows you how to
put<00:01:24.400> wires<00:01:24.640> through<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:25.270> clip<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
put wires through this clip so that the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.499 
put wires through this clip so that the
wires<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.190> least<00:01:27.430> visible<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.300> mic

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
wires is the least visible and the mic

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.930 
wires is the least visible and the mic
is<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.869> most<00:01:29.110> comfortable<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.610> galaxy

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
is the most comfortable on the galaxy

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.730 
is the most comfortable on the galaxy
note<00:01:33.970> 3<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.509> will<00:01:34.600> not<00:01:34.869> sound<00:01:35.140> good<00:01:35.290> with<00:01:35.619> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
note 3 it will not sound good with the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.650 
note 3 it will not sound good with the
standard<00:01:36.220> voice<00:01:36.460> recorder<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.180> comes<00:01:37.450> with

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
standard voice recorder that comes with

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.080 
standard voice recorder that comes with
the<00:01:37.780> device<00:01:38.160> instead<00:01:39.160> I<00:01:39.220> recommend<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.820> free

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
the device instead I recommend the free

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.320 
the device instead I recommend the free
app<00:01:40.300> called<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.869> wreck<00:01:41.200> forged<00:01:41.830> light<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
app called the wreck forged light the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.999 
app called the wreck forged light the
most<00:01:43.540> important<00:01:44.170> thing<00:01:44.290> about<00:01:44.410> this<00:01:44.770> app<00:01:44.979> is

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
most important thing about this app is

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.280 
most important thing about this app is
that<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.580> lets<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.940> turn<00:01:46.240> off<00:01:46.390> automatic<00:01:47.110> gain

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
that it lets you turn off automatic gain

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
that it lets you turn off automatic gain
control<00:01:47.320> or<00:01:48.039> AGC<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.140> let's<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.619> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
control or AGC so let's do that and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.940 
control or AGC so let's do that and
let's<00:01:52.030> also<00:01:52.210> set<00:01:52.509> this<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.899> record<00:01:53.229> in<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.470> wave

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
let's also set this to record in a wave

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.380 
let's also set this to record in a wave
48<00:01:54.880> kilohertz<00:01:55.890> 16-bit<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.069> mono<00:01:57.700> should<00:01:58.210> be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
48 kilohertz 16-bit and mono should be

so audio engineers believe that in a

right<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:57.760> audio<00:02:58.760> quality<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.450> much<00:02:59.810> more

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
right now audio quality is much more

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.140 
right now audio quality is much more
important<00:03:00.590> than<00:03:00.620> video<00:03:01.010> quality<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.730> did<00:03:02.000> not

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
important than video quality I did not

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.880 
important than video quality I did not
believe<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.480> at<00:03:02.750> first<00:03:02.960> but<00:03:03.290> let's<00:03:03.470> look<00:03:03.740> at

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
believe that at first but let's look at

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.730 
believe that at first but let's look at
the<00:03:04.100> example<00:03:04.580> if<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.330> have<00:03:05.570> good<00:03:05.810> audio<00:03:06.080> but

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
the example if you have good audio but

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740 
the example if you have good audio but
not<00:03:06.950> good<00:03:07.160> video<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:07.700> can<00:03:07.910> still<00:03:08.270> sit<00:03:08.540> through

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
not good video you can still sit through

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.420 
not good video you can still sit through
the<00:03:08.930> video<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.500> if<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.830> have<00:03:10.040> high<00:03:10.370> quality

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
the video but if you have high quality

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.940 
the video but if you have high quality
video<00:03:11.240> but<00:03:11.300> not<00:03:11.660> good<00:03:11.870> audio<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.500> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
video but not good audio it is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.520 
video but not good audio it is
unwatchable<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:14.600> if<00:03:14.720> you're<00:03:14.930> into<00:03:15.230> making

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530
