00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.189
 It would be simple cough it's ten fifteen 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.380
 night and many people still 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.020
 playstation network on playstation 4 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.250
 still can not play the truth is that 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.810
 is good at services on xbox live 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 they should be 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.270
 solved although logically good 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.180
 This meant that each check group and 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.850
 you know if being squad says that he has already 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.180
 left the net free not above all of 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 xbox live xbox live and does exactly 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.860
 about 11 minutes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.930
 but he said he had left 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.850
 free the playstation network and what not and that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.430
 all this is not true all this that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.630
 It is happening because they are inconvenient 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 of those attacks of gods that is that 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.739
 as servers with which the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.750
 company, they will take more or less time 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.680
 grenade in the service 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.080
 is that all this has caught us 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 surprise not because they had already warned him 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 that what I do not know is that for good 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.490
 as knowing that they had warned not 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 they have protected more they have not protected us 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.570
 more this is a little shame in that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 meaning I think I say it again 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.800
 that we would have in social networks 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.010
 ask for some kind of compensation for 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.750
 the users 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.360
 The truth is that you are paying a 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.740
 service that you should be able to play and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.290
