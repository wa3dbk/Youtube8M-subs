work<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.369> every<00:01:50.579> ROM<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
work with every ROM so this is the one I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
work with every ROM so this is the one I
choose<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:56.009> ahead<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> open<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.640> up
