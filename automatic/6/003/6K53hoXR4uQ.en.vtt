great bang for the buck factor out of

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
great bang for the buck factor out of
something<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.129> at

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
something like this so if you look at

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.350 
something like this so if you look at
this<00:00:56.370> Sequoia<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> break<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> down<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
this Sequoia and you break it down a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.490 
this Sequoia and you break it down a
little<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.660> further<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little bit further it's going to be a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
little bit further it's going to be a
waterproof<00:00:58.980> jacket<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.489> keep<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.760> mind<00:00:59.789> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
waterproof jacket but keep in mind the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
waterproof jacket but keep in mind the
waterproofing<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.500> removable<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.609> Z

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
waterproofing is not removable it's a Z

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
waterproofing is not removable it's a Z
liner<00:01:03.030> construction<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.080> baked

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
liner construction it's actually baked

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.690 
liner construction it's actually baked
in<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> does<00:01:04.949> breathe<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.610> again

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
in it does breathe but again

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070 
in it does breathe but again
non-removable<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:06.630> why<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> give<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
non-removable that's why I give it that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
non-removable that's why I give it that
cold<00:01:07.290> season<00:01:07.710> rating<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.369> also<00:01:08.610> has<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.240> stowing

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
cold season rating it also has a stowing

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
cold season rating it also has a stowing
go<00:01:10.350> option<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> removable<00:01:11.880> thermal

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
go option for the removable thermal

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670 
go option for the removable thermal
liner<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.750> you're<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> full<00:01:13.409> sleeve

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
liner so you're gonna have a full sleeve

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
liner so you're gonna have a full sleeve
quilted<00:01:14.159> thermal<00:01:14.490> liner<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.570> removed

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
quilted thermal liner that also removed

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
quilted thermal liner that also removed
so<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> becomes<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.770> very<00:01:17.040> versatile<00:01:17.490> jacket<00:01:17.549> if

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so it becomes a very versatile jacket if

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520 
so it becomes a very versatile jacket if
you<00:01:18.119> live<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.360> especially<00:01:19.200> somewhere<00:01:19.409> like

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you live in especially somewhere like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
you live in especially somewhere like
the<00:01:19.619> Pacific<00:01:19.770> Northwest<00:01:20.270> where<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> jacket

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the Pacific Northwest where you a jacket

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.940 
the Pacific Northwest where you a jacket
like<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> Sequoia<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> cover<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
like the Sequoia is going to cover you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
like the Sequoia is going to cover you
most<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> year<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.610> potentially<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
most of the year and potentially you can

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 
most of the year and potentially you can
just<00:01:24.689> pick<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> mess<00:01:25.259> jacket<00:01:25.530> something

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
just pick up a mess jacket something

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
just pick up a mess jacket something
like<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> super<00:01:26.460> vent<00:01:26.640> mesh<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.299> technique

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
like the super vent mesh from technique

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.969 
like the super vent mesh from technique
if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> take<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.680> through<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
if you want to take it through the
