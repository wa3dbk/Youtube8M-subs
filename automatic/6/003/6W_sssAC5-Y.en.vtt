apartments head through the front gate

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.259 
apartments head through the front gate
if<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.160> haven't<00:00:14.429> gone<00:00:14.670> through<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.089> already

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
if you haven't gone through it already

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.320 
if you haven't gone through it already
the<00:00:15.509> code<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.500> zero<00:00:16.859> zero<00:00:17.430> zero<00:00:17.520> one

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the code for that is zero zero zero one

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.599 
the code for that is zero zero zero one
and<00:00:18.619> or<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.920> hack<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> pretty

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and or you can hack it it's a pretty

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.060 
and or you can hack it it's a pretty
easy<00:00:20.820> hack<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.330> level<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.810> believe

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
easy hack it's level two I believe

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.470 
easy hack it's level two I believe
you're<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.460> need<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> level<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.180> hack

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you're going to need a level two hack

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150 
you're going to need a level two hack
augmentation<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.470> order<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.949> through

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
augmentation in order to get through

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
augmentation in order to get through
this<00:00:26.539> because<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.960> apartment<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
this because the apartment is on the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.400 
this because the apartment is on the
third<00:00:28.949> storey<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.490> while<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.630> needs<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.140> level

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
third storey and while it needs a level

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
third storey and while it needs a level
five<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> apartment<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
five to get into the apartment and you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.139 
five to get into the apartment and you
have<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.870> code<00:00:34.079> yeah<00:00:34.890> from<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.520> video<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
have the code yeah from this video the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.049 
have the code yeah from this video the
code<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.690> believe<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.469> two<00:00:37.770> three<00:00:38.100> five<00:00:38.489> six<00:00:38.520> or

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
code I believe is two three five six or

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.400 
code I believe is two three five six or
talking<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.420> don't<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.200> word<00:00:40.379> for

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
talking like that don't take my word for

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.880 
talking like that don't take my word for
it<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.680> look<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> video<00:00:41.480> of<00:00:42.620> course<00:00:43.620> but

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it just look at the video of course but

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
it just look at the video of course but
my<00:00:44.010> Adobe<00:00:44.190> messed<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.850> can't<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
my Adobe messed up I can't see what it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.000 
my Adobe messed up I can't see what it
actually<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.590> follow<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
actually was so just follow what the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
actually was so just follow what the
video<00:00:47.219> showed<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:48.300> you're<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.510> have

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
video showed you then you're gonna have

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
video showed you then you're gonna have
to<00:00:48.750> hack<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> store<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> that's<00:00:49.739> where<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to hack the store and that's where the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.540 
to hack the store and that's where the
level<00:00:50.670> two<00:00:50.850> comes<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.739> think

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
level two comes in I think I think

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.650 
level two comes in I think I think
that's<00:00:53.699> level<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.149> CAC<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
that's level two CAC right there and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
that's level two CAC right there and
it's<00:00:57.660> pretty<00:00:57.780> easy<00:00:57.899> hack<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.500> even<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
it's pretty easy hack you even if you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.069 
it's pretty easy hack you even if you
detect<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> first<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.660> still

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
detect it on the first one you still

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
detect it on the first one you still
have<00:01:01.199> enough<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.520> green

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
have enough time to get the green

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
have enough time to get the green
capture<00:01:03.300> node<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.350> you'll<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.530> able<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
capture node and so you'll be able to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.080 
capture node and so you'll be able to
hack<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> without<00:01:05.309> having<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> use<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> stop

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
hack it without having to use a stop

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.810 
hack it without having to use a stop
virus<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.130> after<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
virus and after this you're going to be

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
virus and after this you're going to be
heading<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> computer<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:10.200> gonna<00:01:10.290> have

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
heading to a computer you're gonna have

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620 
heading to a computer you're gonna have
to<00:01:10.530> hack<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> computer<00:01:11.010> also<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.360> there<00:01:12.570> are

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to hack the computer also so there are

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
to hack the computer also so there are
three<00:01:12.869> hacks<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.680> four<00:01:14.220> hacks

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
three hacks on this or four hacks

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
three hacks on this or four hacks
if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.630> any<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> codes<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
if you don't use any of the codes you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
if you don't use any of the codes you
should<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> codes<00:01:17.729> though<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> them

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
should have the codes though two of them

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.499 
should have the codes though two of them
this<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:19.979> easy<00:01:20.009> hack<00:01:20.509> once

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
this one is a really easy hack once

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
this one is a really easy hack once
again<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.049> won't<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> worry<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.920> much

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
again you won't have to worry that much

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.030 
again you won't have to worry that much
about<00:01:23.490> not<00:01:23.759> being<00:01:24.060> able<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> complete<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
about not being able to complete it and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.530 
about not being able to complete it and
this<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.250> give<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> code<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
this will give you the code for the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.670 
this will give you the code for the
level<00:01:27.810> five<00:01:28.140> hack<00:01:28.439> behind<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
level five hack behind you which is a

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.280 
level five hack behind you which is a
which<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:32.250> storage<00:01:32.670> locker<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
which is a little storage locker and so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
which is a little storage locker and so
head<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> second<00:01:35.640> message<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.180> will

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
head down to the second message it will

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.940 
head down to the second message it will
say<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> code<00:01:37.680> upgrade<00:01:38.720> update<00:01:39.720> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
where I'm showing right here and there

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.840 
where I'm showing right here and there
will<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.170> four<00:02:31.680> gang<00:02:32.010> members<00:02:32.430> right<00:02:32.640> there

in<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:42.450> walkthrough<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.989> guess<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
in this this walkthrough I guess and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.620 
in this this walkthrough I guess and
this<00:02:43.590> guide<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.760> you'll<00:02:44.970> see<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> first<00:02:45.270> one

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
this guide so you'll see the first one

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.979 
this guide so you'll see the first one
there<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.410> take<00:02:46.590> them<00:02:46.739> out<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.989> check

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
there you can take them out and check

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.690 
there you can take them out and check
out<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> map<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.920> feel<00:02:50.130> like<00:02:50.280> hit<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.520> guess

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
out the map if you feel like hit I guess

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.290 
out the map if you feel like hit I guess
and<00:02:51.950> he'll<00:02:52.950> be<00:02:53.130> upset<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.640> first<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.120> then

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
and he'll be upset at first but then

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.770 
and he'll be upset at first but then
you're<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.570> okay<00:02:54.810> sit<00:02:55.290> down<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.630> other

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
you're like okay sit down and the other

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780 
you're like okay sit down and the other
guys<00:02:57.959> get<00:02:58.230> alarmed<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.830> then<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.100> tell<00:02:59.550> them

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
guys get alarmed and then you tell them

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.660 
guys get alarmed and then you tell them
to<00:03:00.030> guess<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.959> bother<00:03:01.200> me<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:02.150> then<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
to guess I bother me and then it's a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
to guess I bother me and then it's a
pretty<00:03:05.670> easy<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.090> take<00:03:06.209> them<00:03:06.299> out<00:03:06.450> just<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:07.019> for

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
pretty easy to take them out just go for

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.410 
pretty easy to take them out just go for
headshots<00:03:07.350> headshot<00:03:08.190> should<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.150> shot
