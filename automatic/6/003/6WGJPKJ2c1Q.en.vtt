00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.000
 a decent beer and a really helpful test 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.670
 Now I have in the living room with which power plant succeeds on the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.999
 best will take place 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.869
 also funny tuber what is actually troops on the ground 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.460
 neither plane on the way where the answer to the four-day biggest 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 Integrate helicopters of the Bundeswehr 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.920
 without the Fiat 53, the Bundeswehr is practical abroad 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.260
 stuck when the ch-53 is Dr transport helicopter of the Bundeswehr 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.219
 Only ask who transports the transporter, for example 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 Afghanistan by helicopter until then is just too far 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.950
 and so the answer looks like it's the Anton 824 the biggest one who paints them 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.280
 regularly built cargo plane of the world Christian Bader has not flown 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 to the Hindu Kush 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.130
 Stevenson 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.130
 Nickname is the list 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 in Afghanistan only the costs of personal data 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 in destroyed landscapes 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.790
 Naval base Nordholz Niedersachsen 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.790
 a giant of the skies starts to land 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.530
 the Bundeswehr uses their helicopters between the Hindu Kush and the North Sea coast 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.700
 back and forth 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.450
 for inspection 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.040
 a job for the most powerful transport aircraft in the world 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.180
 the and Rheinische Anton of Thunder 24 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 To offer pure nature 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.170
 150 flight hours cost the Bundeswehr ever close to 20 million euros 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.330
 nobody else can transport so much so cheaply 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 the gig today 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.060
 The big flier is supposed to take a ch-53 helicopter back to his squadron 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.249
 bring to Afghanistan 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.429
 maybe managers who do not like the Bundeswehr known as a colorful 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.919
 dog 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.389
 APA Euro 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:17.670
 Berggruen in question 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.320
 When the crew has landed then we start creating accommodations 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.909
 the transfer there, the food all in the service of the Croat 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.329
 be more balanced 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.019
 that Regensburg flown 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.419
 The ch-53 reporters have almost 35 years under their belt 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.310
 but since there is no alternative to the robust steadily retrofitted 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.400
 Helicopter gives it off 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 Remain in service in the year 2030 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.009
 Helicopter technician Mike manages the loading 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.369
 he is responsible for the heli 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.259
 register at 84 24 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.259
 no scratch gets 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.580
 and we want the offer we think we can move in as well 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.540
 we just want to steer so Sundern percent she comes, however 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.619
 all winds 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.279
 when used 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.129
 a huge advantage over the Beluga 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.419
 those in cargo planes in Boston 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.850
 instead of the other apparently a simple winch 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.190
 would the helicopter with me have to be built into a scaffold and then 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.190
 awkward to load 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:37.279
 Mike Moses had an eye on stopping in stalls between wife and she had 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.459
 Percentage of cases individually once the role of the OIF so who invented here 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.669
 keep coming 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.289
 in the other case 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.109
 for the latter engine the heavy oil as a boy 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.159
 our lawyers or 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.159
 if that is very close to the cell 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.159
 the entire load takes just an hour 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.949
 among other things, she demanded all of her statements 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.570
 that the location big update 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.879
 are in the cockpit 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.309
 Stand times same break times 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.459
 There are many more besides the two pilots 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.879
 Members in the cockpit 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.189
 this technique dates back to the 80s 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.509
 but as the value 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.490
 because Anton f for this year even the production of the 124 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.110
 resume in a modernized version 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.370
 for the time being 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.720
 The cult band de Höhner fears that misplaced runs the equipment 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.830
 for long-haul flights 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.900
 successful in the world APA we have here called an alligator 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.120
 Spark and two engineers monitoring everything 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.440
 District percent that is really a big crew fights modern aircraft 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.879
 awarded only the two pilots 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.879
 because only if the body immediately 2 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.470
 driven by the cockpit crew 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.040
 the indicative of the boost pressure in the back of the answer 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.770
 Here the technology alone comes in force in the neighborhoods already hundreds of 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.120
 Flight hours spent 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.159
 Spartak Moscow equipped only with the most necessary 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.180
 and trees look outside 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.670
 that is the next goal of the hours of his team's home 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.710
 in the front part there is a kitchenette 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.180
 because he will get along especially on 1000 euros 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.280
 we are otherwise we can no possibility from the statements to 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.520
 Influence of such 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 but otherwise would be interrupted again and again was great 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.379
 they all wear 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.379
 The machine got so out of control 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.749
 many and Alexander starts the engines 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.099
 who are not modest 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.849
 15 thousand 500 liters of fuel are consumed per hour 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.849
 more than he has to 380 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.880
 No one closes before departure and Rheinisches could lead to try lock 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:12.939
 to the loading space 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.119
 then it starts 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:18.499
 Nixon cavalier start the pilot let the engines cheer for minutes 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.050
 Gerstl is Alexander the Borders 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.050
 otherwise the Swede Anton Roth does not depend 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:28.819
 124

 Startelf stand 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.879

 Federal helicopter Kirsten the Tajik capital Dushanbe

 where Mike and his team get the help done 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.189
 many fly the technicians several times a year in the areas of application 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.880
 because the Afghan sand dust puts people to warn 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:09.399
 in the next two years in the euro area by 0 and to the Ombudsman 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:11.569
 turn as you want but only if Homburger 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.080
 Marie Leuenberger nominates Union 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.569
 more in the formation of the residential area 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.370
 we need to get ahead if the location needed more sense so urgently 

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:20.930
 become 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.479
 Boulevard media her the tower a company 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.749
 November Nine evening wear my shop inside Sven son Enzo Boschi standards

 at the same time yesterday 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.949
 sometimes one thinks his decision 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.340
 the St is the present has many 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:51.749
 the Bundeswehr has the theater too serious 

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:55.619
 the name Porst &amp; Châteaux of the 50 employees are station here 

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:00.109
 a constant for the helicopter technicians on site
