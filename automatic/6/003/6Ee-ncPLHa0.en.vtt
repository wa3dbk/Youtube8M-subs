 drawing social life that takes largely 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.360
 of suzel family and in reactors 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.950
 to say that these formats your hair 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.090
 browns that I do not really see what 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.680
 child could recognize himself in these 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 real living doll to cross 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.490
 in this fiction repeats m 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.170
 or a little taste of hazelnut history 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.120
 does then the cinema is made for 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.340
 let's say cfm represents a lot 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.170
 little girls in her looks sign

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.890
 banner making of after mcconnachie 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.750

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.580
 Korean who knows offers framing 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 tight pub and disassembly 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.880
 I have a hard time saying that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.160
 the work is excellent and innovative 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 it's far from paying at least that way 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.620
 competent 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.570
 even if the only use more than 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910
 songs are going to deserve more than one round is 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.200
 well and especially hyper aesthetic the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.000
 young actresses are passionate 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.770
 joy and rivals is endearing despite the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.480
 slimming characters and even if 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.130
 issues are really minimal but the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 everything looks at you without too much trouble 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.150
 said I really have class intruder we do not 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.590
 can not do to gold here but 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.870
 clearly a consumer product 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.760
 if I take the sky maybe a 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.380
 primary goal of entertaining children 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.820
 but who acts under all the morals of 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.860
 life on the importance of creativity 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.050
 the year is believing in one's dreams and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.680
 his friends have more easily see the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.870
 publicity 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.280
 an advertisement whose rotten for Bernard 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.570
 king first hand hours that are selling 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.190
 on average around 100 feet at each 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.160
 with all the accessories clothes in 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.300
 more over the books of the wild side who 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.920
 tell adventures the different 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.060
 and for a billion other objects 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.830
 accessories that sell at prices 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.110
 isu and modest on store points and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 merklinger dot com then and I pose 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.720
 perhaps for far the analysis to you of 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.040
 judge but I feel like it's 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.900
 really the town hall that feed of life 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.220
 who here sold to children with the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.900
 sanitized songs that want nothing 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.280
 laughter of children acting like 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.630
 business women always dressed 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.830
 according to the latest trends of 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.959
 parents who only know about accessories 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.640
 and especially this basic scenario that 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.989
 ultimately means that if we want 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.820
 really something we only have 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.720
 work hard advanced money she 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.150
 country to get it 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.700
 in this film even education becomes 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.959
 good marketable good listen I can 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.910
 use the whole body the reds 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.620
 prairie telecardiology 6 melie as soon 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.239
 the afternoon this one the system 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.739
 of education not enough money will be so 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.320
 to the students to pay the rest of the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.560
 students who have about 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.660
 9 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.160
 a bill that is first nasty one 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.570
 is talking about $ 5,000 for a watercourse and 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.340
 the girls finally won a 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.019
 benefit show which radars cost 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.540
 at least three times more but the idea 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.130
 rest we 'll see what we want I see 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.300
 in this little thing nine years is 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.860
 much more than what is really 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.390
 well but in my opinion when a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 multinational in this film series 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.010
 based on a doll to his life at each I 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.540
 think that's exactly what did 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.070
 the noise is presented then 60 of the total 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.959
 death makes that a beautiful picture that is a 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.120
 little served by the photography shot at 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.440
 sister of john john but it's not the end 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.780
 of the world the audio tracks are to be done 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.700
 in English dts egis a point it is under 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.830
 english french and spanish titles 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.420
 and no bonus here but if you are looking for 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.709
 derivatives tap with a 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.019
 force on google and you are going to be 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.700
 served by after the movie is offered in 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.109
 the wood in the desktop version and its 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.110
 dvd version digital copy 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.570
 also and in ultraviolet version for 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.850
 watching stream and if you pay 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.860
 the sky is a beautiful movie the seas 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.750
 undeniable household sprang the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.160
 actresses are cute and colors 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.020
 leap from the screen we would believe 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.400
 almost an advertisement and then finally 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.229
 we realize that it is a 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.120
 I must note a good background morals 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.190
 are there and well emphasized the energy of a 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.200
 interpreter and contagious even though the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.580
 desired daily not far from this 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.500
 we could all have lived in the primary 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.570
 I had more misery with what 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.060
 hides behind the bottom aspect 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.190
 capitalist breakage that can spoil 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.200
 a childhood and convinces like six years 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.360
 was an integral part here but 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.919
 since his expands sk and a TV movie 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.990
 financial same rivals a company 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.580
 can belong to mater I guess 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.620
 that they were not really amazing it was 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.620
 gilles thanks good viewing
