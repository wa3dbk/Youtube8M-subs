00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
go ahead and put them in there I have

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.770 
go ahead and put them in there I have
the<00:01:45.420> oven<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:46.340> 325<00:01:47.340> degrees<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.600> you're

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the oven on 325 degrees when you're

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
the oven on 325 degrees when you're
cooking<00:01:48.959> a<00:01:49.200> bird<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> convection<00:01:50.039> oven

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
cooking a bird with a convection oven

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.789 
cooking a bird with a convection oven
you<00:01:50.969> want<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.569> that<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.289> to<00:01:52.380> cook

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
you want to know that it's going to cook

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.620 
you want to know that it's going to cook
faster<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.789> what<00:01:53.969> happens<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.539> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
faster because what happens in a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539 
faster because what happens in a
convection<00:01:54.959> oven<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.439> there's<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.250> heat

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
convection oven is there's more heat

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
convection oven is there's more heat
that's<00:01:56.759> circulating<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.929> around<00:01:58.229> so

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that's circulating all the way around so

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.440 
that's circulating all the way around so
it's<00:01:58.560> able<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.069> actually<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.209> bird

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it's able to actually get to the bird

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
it's able to actually get to the bird
and<00:02:00.750> encompass<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.739> the<00:02:01.860> heat<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.429> much

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and encompass it with the heat that much

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
and encompass it with the heat that much
faster<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.810> cooking<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.439> should<00:02:04.500> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
faster so your cooking time should be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.120 
faster so your cooking time should be
about<00:02:05.689> 25%<00:02:06.689> less<00:02:06.750> than<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.319> normally<00:02:07.470> would<00:02:07.770> be

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
about 25% less than it normally would be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.789 
about 25% less than it normally would be
my<00:02:08.759> bet<00:02:08.970> bird<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.509> 14<00:02:10.049> pounds<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> will

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
my bet bird is 14 pounds so it will

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.089 
my bet bird is 14 pounds so it will
probably<00:02:11.099> take<00:02:11.610> about<00:02:12.090> two<00:02:12.930> hours<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.500> two<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
probably take about two hours to two and

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.949 
probably take about two hours to two and
a<00:02:14.130> half<00:02:14.340> hours<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> cook<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> best

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
a half hours for it to cook but the best

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.690 
a half hours for it to cook but the best
way<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.200> check<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> doneness<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.250> your

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
way to check for the doneness of your

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.330 
way to check for the doneness of your
bird<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.120> check<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.260> meat<00:02:19.410> thermometer<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:20.160> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
bird is check the meat thermometer if it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
bird is check the meat thermometer if it
reaches<00:02:20.640> 180<00:02:21.269> degrees<00:02:21.799> Fahrenheit<00:02:22.799> then<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit then you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit then you
know<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.640> perfectly<00:02:24.150> done<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> cooked

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
know that it's perfectly done and cooked

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:34.960 
know that it's perfectly done and cooked
and<00:02:25.079> just<00:02:25.440> perfect

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.070 

so<00:02:35.970> we'll<00:02:36.090> come<00:02:36.270> back<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.630> bird<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
so we'll come back to that bird and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.230 
so we'll come back to that bird and
check<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.500> about<00:02:37.860> an<00:02:37.980> hour<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> half<00:02:38.490> so

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
check on it about an hour and a half so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.030 
check on it about an hour and a half so
I've<00:02:39.360> taken<00:02:39.600> my<00:02:39.780> bird<00:02:40.050> out<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> oven<00:02:40.709> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
I've taken my bird out of the oven and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.210 
I've taken my bird out of the oven and
here<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.270> think<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.660> looks<00:02:42.870> fantastic

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
here it is I think it looks fantastic

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.490 
here it is I think it looks fantastic
it's<00:02:44.220> reached<00:02:44.580> 180<00:02:45.300> degrees<00:02:45.690> Fahrenheit<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.260> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it's reached 180 degrees Fahrenheit so I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.990 
it's reached 180 degrees Fahrenheit so I
know<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.980> means<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.520> perfectly

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
know that it means that it's perfectly

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.449 
know that it means that it's perfectly
cooked<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.480> well<00:02:48.690> done<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.290> golden<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.430> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
cooked and well done it's golden on the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.640 
cooked and well done it's golden on the
outside<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.569> see<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> juices<00:02:52.319> on<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
outside and I can see the juices on the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
outside and I can see the juices on the
inside<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.750> smells<00:02:54.870> really

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
inside and this just smells really

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.979 
inside and this just smells really
fantastic<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.580> rule<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.540> thumb<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:57.930> your

the oven you might want to let it sit

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400 
the oven you might want to let it sit
for<00:03:01.830> about<00:03:02.040> 15<00:03:02.430> minutes<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.540> allows<00:03:03.900> all<00:03:04.140> of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
for about 15 minutes this allows all of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.830 
for about 15 minutes this allows all of
the<00:03:04.500> juices<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.950> go<00:03:05.250> back<00:03:05.610> into<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.239> turkey<00:03:06.660> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the juices to go back into the turkey so
