00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello everyone today I come with another video is not that we are going to do two things 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.429
 very simple 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.619
 The first thing I want to show you is 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.470
 update your computer's drivers 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.720
 the two trailers that tell you 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.960
 without having to go through the manufacturer's page 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.759
 to save us the trouble of going to the manufacturer's page and this 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.029
 let's produce 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'm going to show you how to do it from the control panel 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 let's go to the control panel 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.380
 and here we give you where you are managing devices 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 and here is a list of all the controllers 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 here you choose the one you want to update 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.900
 for example extra 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.650
 they just give him right foot and these give him update they are controller judge 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.660
 and it remains to ask 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.120
 Komon wants to look for or shower controller 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.200
 lan the first option that says look for driver show 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.900
 current are automatically 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.220
 says Windows will search on the computer and on the internet the driver's sleep more 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 recent for the device 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.460
 the Danish and let windows take care of the rest 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.800
 and then 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.430
 this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.190
 how to update the incoming controllers go through the page of the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.270
 maker 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.580
 another thing that I want to show you how a 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.370
 with erasing how to do so that internet explorer did not exist in a box 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.230
 and on a page 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.710
 who have visited 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.840
 the history of the pages 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.830
 iun 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.830
 good only if someone wants it sometimes this one 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.950
 adduces some maybe it is good to do so to respect our privacy 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.830
 It is usually a person 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 share your computer with someone 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.410
 ye abancay although sometimes also this 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.410
 This is highly recommended because sometimes we forget some internal page 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.069
 then we want to give it 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.700
 and we did not remember the name was exactly and we found that typing 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 the first letters sometimes do not look for them appear 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.079
 but as I tell you only for those who wish to do it equally our panel 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.479
 control 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.479
 we are not going to give networks and internet 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.319
 and this is where you get internet options 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.319
 do not appear extra after seeing this mentality 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.430
 the mutation of s 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.430
 scan history we give you configuration 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.719
 and here we are not going to go where six bullfight 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.699
 here it says specify the number of days that the internet should be 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:47.490
 the color 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.920
 d flower save the list of visited websites 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.379
 here it is doubtful says to keep pages in the history for these days with 20 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.049
 if you do not want me to keep anything soleÃ¡ that the exam after zero 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.590
 propose resumed save any pages of those who had visited 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.590
 they should only accept 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.389
 then ready there is 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.389
 according to day they are to erase the history from 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.449
 of the websites that have visited 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.879
 then this would be all 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.480
 a greeting to the whole community of the text a greeting to all my friends 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.449
 to all my friends too 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.739
 Well, do not give us in a next video until later
