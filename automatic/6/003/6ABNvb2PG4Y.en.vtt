a modified reverse tanto which is kind
of<00:02:25.870> cool<00:02:26.080> something<00:02:26.500> different<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.370> definitely

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
of cool something different I definitely

that I did it just lived up to
expectations<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:52.150> really<00:03:52.390> like<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:53.470> thickness

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
expectations I really like the thickness

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.699 
expectations I really like the thickness

cutting edge there for the size and

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.520 
cutting edge there for the size and
weight<00:04:03.370> which<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:03.970> really<00:04:04.270> dig<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.510> as<00:04:04.990> well

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
weight which I really dig that as well

weight which I really dig that as well
it<00:04:06.520> is<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:06.910> benchmate<00:04:07.360> blue<00:04:07.660> class<00:04:07.959> that's<00:04:08.380> a

it is in benchmate blue class that's a
it's<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.070> good<00:04:09.280> line<00:04:09.580> of<00:04:09.610> knives<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:10.300> they

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
it's a good line of knives that they

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.320 
it's a good line of knives that they
sell<00:04:10.720> over<00:04:10.930> there<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:13.620> guess<00:04:14.620> drawbacks

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
sell over there and I guess drawbacks

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.070

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
I don't really care too much but the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.980 
I don't really care too much but the
pocket<00:04:31.540> clip<00:04:31.630> was<00:04:32.050> very<00:04:32.440> very<00:04:32.800> tight<00:04:33.100> actually

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
pocket clip was very very tight actually

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.470 
pocket clip was very very tight actually
kind<00:04:34.990> of<00:04:35.280> bent<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.460> out<00:04:36.670> just<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.030> kind<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.300> give

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
kind of bent it out just to kind of give

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.150 
kind of bent it out just to kind of give
me<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.600> little<00:04:37.900> bit<00:04:38.020> more<00:04:38.200> clearance<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.770> was<00:04:38.920> so

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
me a little bit more clearance it was so

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.970 
me a little bit more clearance it was so
tight<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.580> was<00:04:39.670> basically<00:04:40.060> tearing<00:04:40.630> up<00:04:40.780> all<00:04:41.380> my

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
tight it was basically tearing up all my

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.580 
tight it was basically tearing up all my
pockets<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:44.520> surprisingly<00:04:45.520> this<00:04:46.590> this

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
pockets and surprisingly this this

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.700 
pockets and surprisingly this this
aluminum<00:04:48.250> scale<00:04:48.640> it's<00:04:49.450> not<00:04:49.690> as<00:04:49.990> aggressive<00:04:50.590> as

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
aluminum scale it's not as aggressive as

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.920 
aluminum scale it's not as aggressive as
GTN<00:04:51.280> obviously<00:04:51.730> but<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.510> was<00:04:52.630> enough<00:04:52.900> to

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
GTN obviously but it was enough to

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.630 
GTN obviously but it was enough to
basically<00:04:53.530> start<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.010> wear<00:04:54.250> down<00:04:54.280> those

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
basically start to wear down those

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.560 
basically start to wear down those
pockets<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:57.100> bit<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:57.730> out<00:04:57.970> it's<00:04:58.210> kind<00:04:58.480> of

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
pockets so I bit this out it's kind of

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.330 
pockets so I bit this out it's kind of
helping<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:58.900> problem<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.740> mean<00:05:00.040> that's<00:05:00.220> a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
helping that problem I mean that's a

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.580 
helping that problem I mean that's a
real<00:05:00.550> minor<00:05:00.910> minor<00:05:01.300> thing<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.410> only

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
real minor minor thing and the only

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.000 
real minor minor thing and the only
other<00:05:02.800> thing<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.310> typically<00:05:03.970> Benchmade<00:05:05.010> it's

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
other thing is typically Benchmade it's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.250 
other thing is typically Benchmade it's
just<00:05:06.250> what<00:05:06.400> I've<00:05:06.520> found<00:05:06.820> from<00:05:07.270> my<00:05:07.480> little<00:05:08.140> bit

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
just what I've found from my little bit

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.640 
just what I've found from my little bit
of<00:05:08.350> experience<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:10.720> bevel<00:05:11.170> on<00:05:11.380> their

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
of experience but the bevel on their

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.520 
of experience but the bevel on their
cutting<00:05:12.100> edge<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.120> bit<00:05:13.570> steep<00:05:13.960> from<00:05:14.410> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
cutting edge is a bit steep from the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.710 
cutting edge is a bit steep from the
factory<00:05:15.040> it's<00:05:15.910> just<00:05:16.120> something<00:05:16.480> that<00:05:16.510> I've

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
factory it's just something that I've

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.890 
factory it's just something that I've
noticed<00:05:17.230> recently<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:19.180> Apostle<00:05:19.660> Peter

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
noticed recently the Apostle Peter

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.250 
noticed recently the Apostle Peter
profiled<00:05:20.710> my<00:05:20.890> mini<00:05:21.160> grip<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.570> really<00:05:22.990> like

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
profiled my mini grip and I really like

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.280 
profiled my mini grip and I really like
where<00:05:24.040> he<00:05:24.280> got<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.550> it's<00:05:25.480> gonna<00:05:25.600> be<00:05:25.780> easy<00:05:26.050> to

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
where he got that it's gonna be easy to

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.430 
where he got that it's gonna be easy to
touch<00:05:26.530> up<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.880> is<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.630> can't<00:05:29.320> remember

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
touch up and it is I can't remember

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.320 
touch up and it is I can't remember
exactly<00:05:29.590> where<00:05:30.250> he<00:05:30.340> brought<00:05:30.640> it<00:05:30.850> down<00:05:31.030> maybe

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
exactly where he brought it down maybe

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.950 
exactly where he brought it down maybe
18<00:05:31.930> degrees<00:05:32.970> he<00:05:33.970> can<00:05:34.180> maybe<00:05:34.330> roll<00:05:34.600> it<00:05:34.780> in<00:05:34.930> the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
18 degrees he can maybe roll it in the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.410 
18 degrees he can maybe roll it in the
comments<00:05:35.560> or<00:05:35.650> I'll<00:05:35.740> annotate<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.520> but<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.300> think

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
comments or I'll annotate it but I think

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.690 
comments or I'll annotate it but I think
I'm<00:05:37.660> gonna<00:05:37.810> maybe<00:05:38.140> send<00:05:38.830> this<00:05:38.950> one<00:05:39.160> up<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.490> him

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
I'm gonna maybe send this one up to him

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.540 
I'm gonna maybe send this one up to him
for<00:05:40.090> a<00:05:40.120> reprofiling<00:05:40.570> job<00:05:41.170> it's<00:05:41.710> sharp<00:05:42.070> as<00:05:42.250> is

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
for a reprofiling job it's sharp as is

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.240 
for a reprofiling job it's sharp as is
don't<00:05:42.850> get<00:05:42.970> me<00:05:43.120> wrong<00:05:43.560> it's<00:05:44.560> just<00:05:44.680> something

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
don't get me wrong it's just something

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.880 
don't get me wrong it's just something
that<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.730> found<00:05:46.480> that<00:05:46.750> could<00:05:47.080> be<00:05:47.260> made<00:05:47.470> a<00:05:47.500> little

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
that I found that could be made a little

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.360 
that I found that could be made a little
bit<00:05:48.130> better<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.810> Apostle<00:05:50.290> P<00:05:50.500> he<00:05:51.190> does

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
bit better and the Apostle P he does

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.710 
bit better and the Apostle P he does
some<00:05:51.550> sharpening<00:05:52.060> over<00:05:52.240> there<00:05:52.390> he's<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.510> good

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
some sharpening over there he's a good

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.680 
some sharpening over there he's a good
buddy<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.640> he's<00:05:54.640> seen<00:05:54.910> this<00:05:55.090> knife<00:05:55.330> actually

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
buddy and he's seen this knife actually

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.050

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
handle it and I believe maybe he even

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.810 
handle it and I believe maybe he even
noted<00:06:00.370> that<00:06:00.490> then<00:06:00.820> but<00:06:01.200> anyhow<00:06:02.200> that<00:06:02.560> is<00:06:03.220> the

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
so long and I'm glad that it lived up
