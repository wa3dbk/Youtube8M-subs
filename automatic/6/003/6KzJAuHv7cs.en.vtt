00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
which is pretty cool you there's no

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.390 
which is pretty cool you there's no
actual<00:03:42.300> multitasking<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.080> but<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.410> can<00:03:43.650> play

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
actual multitasking you but you can play

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.890 
actual multitasking you but you can play
the<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:45.300> can<00:03:45.480> keep<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.770> last<00:03:47.310> six<00:03:47.900> open

programs<00:03:49.290> open<00:03:49.740> in<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:51.360> background<00:03:51.570> order<00:03:52.080> I

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
programs open in the background order I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.190 
programs open in the background order I
guess<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.370> there's<00:03:53.610> no<00:03:53.730> actual<00:03:54.480> multitasking

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
guess so there's no actual multitasking

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.890 
guess so there's no actual multitasking

if<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.729> did<00:04:34.060> use<00:04:34.270> picasa<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.810> lot<00:04:35.080> i<00:04:35.380> don't<00:04:35.979> so

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
if you did use picasa a lot i don't so

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.159 
if you did use picasa a lot i don't so
it<00:04:36.580> wasn't<00:04:37.270> anything<00:04:37.539> major<00:04:38.070> for<00:04:39.070> me<00:04:39.190> and

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
it wasn't anything major for me and

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.719 
it wasn't anything major for me and
everything<00:04:41.169> switches<00:04:41.860> between<00:04:41.979> portrait<00:04:42.520> and

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
everything switches between portrait and

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.550 
everything switches between portrait and
landscape<00:04:43.180> very<00:04:43.570> nicely<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.139> that's<00:04:44.320> pretty

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
landscape very nicely so that's pretty
