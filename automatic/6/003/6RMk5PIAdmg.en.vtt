00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
work and this marker tells me where I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
work and this marker tells me where I
stopped<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.930> increase<00:00:52.530> stitches<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
stopped to increase stitches so I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.610 
stopped to increase stitches so I
stopped<00:00:56.030> when<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.149> increased<00:00:57.690> every<00:00:57.989> seventh

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
stopped when I increased every seventh

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.189 
stopped when I increased every seventh
stitch<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> second<00:01:00.750> marker

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
stitch and here I put a second marker

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.939 
stitch and here I put a second marker
this<00:01:01.410> tells<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.059> begin

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
this tells me where what I have to begin

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.719 
this tells me where what I have to begin
increasing<00:01:04.949> again<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:07.159> at<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> point<00:01:09.619> it's

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
increasing again and at this point it's

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.469 
increasing again and at this point it's
the<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> hat<00:01:14.369> about<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.119> ears

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the you can see the hat about the ears

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.289 
the you can see the hat about the ears
and<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.820> increase

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and so now we will have to increase

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:32.890 
and so now we will have to increase
again<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.229> stopped

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.430 

I<00:01:33.130> stopped<00:01:34.130> here<00:01:34.520> at<00:01:34.730> the<00:01:35.210> seventh<00:01:35.720> stitch<00:01:35.990> and
