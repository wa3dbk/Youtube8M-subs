00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello people in this video is about 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 the block b 5 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 it belongs to the new gaming series from 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.490
 logitech this is about 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.439
 the refresh edition of the old g 500 times 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.100
 on the front of the pack is the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.500
 to see a mouse and a small one 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 window is installed 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.019
 a little text is already on 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 the inside over optimized 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.989
 Surface materials and robust what 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 because of robust and water-repellent 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 Surface It's just you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 use new optimized materials 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.140
 whether the difference is recognizable 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.629
 I do not say it yet 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 standing on the right side 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.820
 Information in English and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.460
 French on the back 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.710
 other information in many 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.500
 different languages 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.840
 what is possible with the mouse and on the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 On the left side of the packaging, these are the ones 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.560
 German information that one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.369
 resolution from 200 to 8200 ep possible 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.380
 are the difference to compare himself 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.840
 old kilo gt500 only had 200 to 5,700 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 dpi 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.520
 the reaction and the lubricity are 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.439
 the same for the old and the new g 500 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 and the durability it became 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.009
 so tested 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.450
 with the keys up to 20 million clicks 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.500
 when the old ones were only 8 million 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.990
 and feet on both at 250 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.080
 kilometers on wood was tested 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.520
 I'm not sure 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.930
 so now to unpack packaging inner 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.900
 grabbing yourself is natural 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 the mouse and as usual the weights it 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.130
 is possible again 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:21.000
 On the bottom weights from 1.7 to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:23.550
 4.5 grams to install better around the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.940
 mouse to better adapt 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.260
 to the respective user of course 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.680
 are in it again 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.360
 manuals in the setup guide and important 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.020
 information on a driver cd became 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.560
 this time dispensed with course 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.990
 always advisable is the latest software 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.110
 and driver software from the manufacturer 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.310
 directly on the website 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.430
 if you have the old and the new b 500 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.800
 Comparing, you realize it's not a big one 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.350
 difference is here are both 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.640
 pretty much in hand when 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.440
 material you notice only one 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.300
 small difference in my opinion 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.530
 Of course we are the same with the old one 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.790
 g500 again the buttons on the same 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:22.530
 positions available for changing the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.390
 resolution or or speed then 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 again the programmable buttons on 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.080
 the page the display of the set 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:36.090
 resolution and against this button in the 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.519
 Turn the middle of the wheel by 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.580
 leave and therefore has no resistance 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.910
 It can be more simply from forest 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.910
 rotate 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.390
 I think it was by and large 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.010
 already 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.930
 whether there is a change from the old up 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.739
 the new g 500 is worthwhile for everyone 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.130
 leave 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:59.160
 in my opinion is not a big one 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.370
 difference exists but there is 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.790
 of course in the eye of the beholder 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.790
 Until next time
