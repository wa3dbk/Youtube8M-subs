00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
body but perhaps the very worst thing

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.320

about<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:01.030> game<00:02:01.299> this<00:02:01.689> cheetah<00:02:02.560> men<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.330> game

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
about this game this cheetah men to game

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.770 
about this game this cheetah men to game
is<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.590> very<00:02:06.009> poor<00:02:06.490> hit<00:02:06.729> detection<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
is the very poor hit detection the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.660 
is the very poor hit detection the
normal<00:02:08.140> link<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:08.500> will<00:02:08.560> probably<00:02:09.069> take<00:02:09.310> you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
normal link that will probably take you

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.070 
normal link that will probably take you
to<00:02:10.380> lose<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> life<00:02:11.799> is<00:02:12.250> maybe<00:02:13.000> about<00:02:13.330> 20<00:02:13.569> seconds

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
to lose a life is maybe about 20 seconds

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.300 
to lose a life is maybe about 20 seconds
and<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.799> no<00:02:15.130> exaggeration<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:16.690> game<00:02:16.959> is

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and that is no exaggeration this game is

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.220 
and that is no exaggeration this game is
difficult<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.580> difficult<00:02:18.970> not<00:02:19.780> because

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
difficult and it's difficult not because

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.680 
difficult and it's difficult not because
of<00:02:20.500> challenge<00:02:21.280> factor<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.180> because<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.569> all

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
of challenge factor but because of all

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.020 
of challenge factor but because of all
the<00:02:22.840> cheap<00:02:23.079> hits<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.560> take<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.250> because<00:02:24.849> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the cheap hits you take and because you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.710 
the cheap hits you take and because you
can't<00:02:25.329> jump<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.590> even<00:02:26.950> more<00:02:27.910> difficult<00:02:28.180> oh

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
