00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.850
 hello everyone good here is for 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.499
 shear welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.230
 today I bring you the review of angel di 

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:09.880
 Maria at the hands of max as always 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.650
 description you have the page for 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.230
 buy coins and a discount code 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.820
 to get an additional rebate and 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.410
 Well, we're seeing Di Maria 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.650
 was the other hands that came out after 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.390
 the champions final this Saturday and 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.669
 well let's see your are you without 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.220
 game are the same as those of the thymus 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.980
 but in this case change the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 position and the hands of match sms or their 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.790
 97 best stats 97 value control 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.490
 297 of effects 93 of dribble 90 of pass 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.760
 long 90 far shot 99 power 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.390
 of shooting 94 acceleration 97 the reality and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.220
 94 speed as I told you are the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.500
 same start as those who have the letter 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.150
 last that they are and well let's see 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.090
 a few tips on what we value 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.670
 Well, if the states that the letter shows 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.650
 of mariah deserve as they render in the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.670
 field are how they perform in the field they 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.970
 course also a couple of assists 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.080
 in corners and so you can see more or 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.600
 less 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.100
 as I do not know how he attends and so that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.140
 let's have a little bit of variety and good 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.260
 let's talk a little bit about the letter 92 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.840
 of rhythm that I think does not seem so 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.360
 quick for the ball control like 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.100
 you will know by now there are players 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.960
 that by the ball control you do not 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.940
 they seem as fast as in the letter more 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.260
 whether they are or not and he and me 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.720
 I think it's one of those cases 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.560
 the control of the ball the 92 that either 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.590
 is perfection let's say but yes 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.050
 you do not feel it as fast as 92 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.510
 to see is not a rhythm of 80 nor much 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.720
 less but not even being very fast 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.820
 you do not notice it as 92 of rhythm then 87 of 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.470
 passes has a pretty good pass on 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.330
 all at the time of centering what happens 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.920
 which of course, if we use it mese or not 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.630
 let's take advantage of both the center and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.940
 in band 90 of 91 dribble a 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 pretty good dribble very good control 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.180
 of balloon 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.680
 you can say plodding as they would say 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.420
 Argentines perfectly with the new 62 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.640
 of defense that in its case then not 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.030
 it matters a lot even though being more or 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.920
 can place ms or even msb 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.600
 perfectly thanks to his defense that 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.810
 their word rights is not completely low 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.340
 which are high high and then 70 headbutton 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 that in this letter it does not influence much 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.690
 we turn now to the pros and cons 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.120
 the pros the rhythm is a fast player 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.880
 it does not reach 92 but it's still pretty 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.750
 fast the pass that I'm telling you is a 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.570
 player who gives 1 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.460
 some pretty accurate passes do not get to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.290
 stand out above the world 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.360
 like the case of xavi or this and that's 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.210
 you already know you know but yes it is 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.530
 a pretty good step then the dribble 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.120
 I have a dribble that I already tell you 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.610
 you can do what you want with the ball 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.170
 at any time but that yes never 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.420
 with the right leg always everything with 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.130
 the polyvalent left is a player 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.320
 that you can use it from new false 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.740
 even forward although good forward 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.690
 with those waits maybe it's not quite 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.390
 well but of false nine mediapunta ene 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.860
 efe or mc or even as I say mcd 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.709
 also then I was able to try a couple of 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.720
 matches for me goes pretty well and it's 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.360
 quite polyvalent not at the level of yaya 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.120
 touré or of vidal or of pomp because those 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.010
 they are physical beasts but yes that you can 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.930
 use and be able to perform at any 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.250
 position and then four mats of 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.930
 filigree that you already know I put it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.820
 always on pro because they are resources of 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.640
 the more you have a player then the 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.830
 cons of the shot is an inaccurate shot not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.530
 I'm going to say a bad shot 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.910
 because it's not a bad shot but and the shot 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.590
 to place is actually very good but the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.990
 tee the power is somewhat inaccurate in the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.230
 sense that it does not always go 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.420
 escorada bats is more or less the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.170
 shot of diego costa for you to do 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.000
 an idea 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.370
 It is very similar but a little less 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.900
 powerful so good then pretty much 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.020
 to give you an idea is a shot 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.819
 similar and good as we speak now of 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.520
 the opinion of the letter in the rhythm I 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.290
 I have removed three points and I tell you that 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.569
 just like that runs what happens that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.790
 how does he carry a ball control 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.739
 let's say with the ball so close to the foot 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.690
 It seems that runs less but ya 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.840
 I say there's really no way to measure 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.300
 that I eat as I do not have noticed that 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.799
 I ran 92 because I had downloaded it but 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.769
 I tell them will also depend a lot on 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.320
 how the six then the shot is also 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.090
 has dropped another three points since for 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.450
 me well I tell you a pretty shot 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.280
 imprecise and still the quality shot 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.770
 yes yes it's pretty good about 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.720
 all the left with the right not 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.280
 do not use the bad leg of 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.680
 primary for nothing is like the school 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.660
 has it to climb is good to climb 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.520
 in bus universe as it directs 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.770
 manolo lamá has it for to walk and 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.900
 a little newer 90 pass is a pass 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.900
 good normal I left it there are no reasons 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.850
 to get down the 93 dribble that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.050
 with good ball control fails 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.629
 to 93 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 it is left in 91 that I think is 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.650
 more or less what I should have and then 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.419
 62 defense and 70 headers that 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.099
 yes I have left it the same and good 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.800
 Well, these projects against him do it 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.539
 deserving of a grade of 92 for me is 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.639
 one of the best midfielders 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.860
 offensive that we can have in the league 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.560
 Spanish because it has rhythm is not so 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.250
 difficult to pull is not to see is weak 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.819
 but inside what the appearance 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.199
 di Maria's physique so thin and so 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.870
 the truth is that it is not as weak as 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.490
 could pretend for example is something else 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.979
 strong that neymar for you to make a 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.900
 idea and then well that has a good shot 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.330
 not the best but a good shot a good 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.400
 pass a good dribble and rhythm me 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.990
 I think it's the best we can 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.659
 buy as for mention in the league 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.120
 Spanish and to want to make a team 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.530
 Argentinean and nothing because until now it has gone 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.759
 the review you know what's always the ax 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.169
 favorite you liked the video 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.759
 you have the twitter in the description 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.370
 such sensitive errors for any 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.849
 doubt or suggestion and nothing a greeting and 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.849
 see you soon
