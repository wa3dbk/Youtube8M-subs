00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
when it was dry

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.280 
when it was dry
ripping<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> air<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.059> then<00:00:33.390> when

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
ripping all of the air out and then when
I<00:00:34.320> did<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.680> when<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.160> wet<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.790> didn't<00:00:36.360> rip

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I did it when it was wet it didn't rip

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
I did it when it was wet it didn't rip
as<00:00:36.690> much<00:00:37.079> hair<00:00:37.410> out<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.219> still<00:00:38.399> pretty

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

long<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.600> bundles<00:01:47.990> were<00:01:48.140> because<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.530> know

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
long the bundles were because you know

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.410 
long the bundles were because you know
sometimes<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.340> bundles<00:01:49.729> shrink<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.270> feel

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
sometimes the bundles shrink and I feel

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.809 
sometimes the bundles shrink and I feel
like<00:01:50.539> those<00:01:50.689> shrink<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.039> feel<00:01:52.549> like<00:01:52.670> if

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
like those shrink so I feel like if

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.210 
like those shrink so I feel like if
anything<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.899> bottom<00:01:54.500> two<00:01:54.679> bundles<00:01:54.890> are

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
anything the bottom two bundles are

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.279 
anything the bottom two bundles are
probably<00:01:55.579> about<00:01:55.759> twenty<00:01:56.299> two<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.020> top

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
probably about twenty two and the top

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.559 
probably about twenty two and the top
one<00:01:57.560> was<00:01:57.740> probably<00:01:57.979> about<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.869> 20<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:02.390> that's

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
one was probably about it 20 so that's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.839 
one was probably about it 20 so that's
the<00:02:02.840> specs<00:02:03.200> should<00:02:03.259> everything<00:02:03.770> my<00:02:04.520> clean

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
the specs should everything my clean
