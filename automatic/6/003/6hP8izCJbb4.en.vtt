wrench snug those up it's like so and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:59.580 
wrench snug those up it's like so and
now<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.580> speed<00:01:48.910> controller<00:01:49.300> is<00:01:49.479> mount<00:01:58.050> now<00:01:59.050> as

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
now the speed controller is mount now as

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.160 
now the speed controller is mount now as
you<00:01:59.650> can<00:01:59.920> see<00:01:59.979> there<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.300> lot<00:02:01.720> more<00:02:01.750> room

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
controller and it's a very secure mount

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.920 
controller and it's a very secure mount
thanks<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.780> watching<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.230> keep<00:02:14.380> having<00:02:14.739> fun
