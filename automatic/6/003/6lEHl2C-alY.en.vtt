00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
enviros they fall into a coma the virus
begins<00:00:57.239> changing<00:00:57.780> their<00:00:57.930> bodies<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:58.469> the

one of the coumarin creatures do the

conversion<00:01:17.690> once<00:01:18.690> this<00:01:18.900> loads<00:01:20.360> we're<00:01:21.360> going

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
conversion once this loads we're going

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.440 
conversion once this loads we're going
to<00:01:21.570> play<00:01:21.830> conversion<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> conversion

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

to play conversion at the conversion
center<00:01:24.980> at<00:01:26.060> 515<00:01:28.940> gotta<00:01:29.940> love<00:01:30.120> how<00:01:30.330> they<00:01:30.510> add

one<00:04:49.660> of<00:04:49.720> these<00:04:49.810> beastly<00:04:50.350> creatures<00:04:51.010> but<00:04:51.220> I

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
one of these beastly creatures but I

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.740 
one of these beastly creatures but I
have<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.430> feeling<00:04:51.669> we're<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.300> be<00:04:52.419> going

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
have a feeling we're going to be going

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.950 
have a feeling we're going to be going
we're<00:04:53.620> going<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:54.039> be<00:04:54.190> running<00:04:54.340> into<00:04:54.699> one

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
we're going to be running into one

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.020 
we're going to be running into one
hopefully<00:04:55.960> not<00:04:56.139> once<00:04:57.100> again<00:04:57.400> another<00:04:57.639> guy<00:04:57.970> who

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
hopefully not once again another guy who

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.650 
hopefully not once again another guy who
got<00:04:58.330> wheeled<00:04:58.539> in<00:04:58.720> on<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.840> cart<00:04:59.169> I<00:05:00.389> wonder<00:05:01.389> if<00:05:01.539> I

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
got wheeled in on a cart I wonder if I

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:16.010 
got wheeled in on a cart I wonder if I
could<00:05:09.720> scorpion

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.510 

okay<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:16.919> two<00:05:17.069> sticky

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.510 

hopefully<00:05:20.520> that's<00:05:20.730> it<00:05:21.540> ok<00:05:22.169> ok<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:23.220> think<00:05:23.340> I

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
hopefully that's it ok ok I think I

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.330 
hopefully that's it ok ok I think I
could<00:05:23.699> switch<00:05:23.940> grenades<00:05:24.949> ok<00:05:25.949> I<00:05:25.980> don't<00:05:26.100> have

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
could switch grenades ok I don't have

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.370 
could switch grenades ok I don't have
any<00:05:26.490> more<00:05:26.669> grenades<00:05:29.449> from<00:05:30.449> the<00:05:30.540> hedgehog<00:05:31.169> or

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
any more grenades from the hedgehog or

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:46.879 
any more grenades from the hedgehog or
knit<00:05:31.560> or<00:05:32.310> these<00:05:32.610> things<00:05:40.669> that's<00:05:41.669> right<00:05:45.889> switch

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
knit or these things that's right switch

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.490 
knit or these things that's right switch
guns<00:05:47.160> here<00:05:47.669> once<00:05:48.060> again<00:05:48.210> low<00:05:48.840> on<00:05:49.020> ammo<00:05:49.350> for

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
guns here once again low on ammo for

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.350 
guns here once again low on ammo for
this<00:05:49.650> again<00:05:49.889> so<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.220> apparently<00:05:50.910> haven't<00:05:51.180> found

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
this again so I apparently haven't found

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.719 
this again so I apparently haven't found
any<00:05:51.600> more<00:05:51.810> shotgun<00:05:52.169> ok<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:52.740> got<00:05:52.979> a<00:05:53.010> plenty<00:05:53.310> ammo

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
any more shotgun ok I got a plenty ammo

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.670 
any more shotgun ok I got a plenty ammo
for<00:05:53.910> this<00:05:54.060> gun<00:05:54.270> now<00:05:54.510> break<00:05:55.260> this<00:05:55.440> door<00:05:55.740> down

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
for this gun now break this door down

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.360 
for this gun now break this door down
apparently<00:05:58.680> that's<00:05:58.800> not<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.100> way<00:05:59.220> you're

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
apparently that's not the way you're

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:10.010 
apparently that's not the way you're
supposed<00:05:59.490> to<00:05:59.729> go<00:06:01.729> okay<00:06:02.729> this<00:06:02.940> is<00:06:03.120> just<00:06:09.020> just

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020
