00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 dock dock that we see there just below 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 the tablet is it becomes a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 true game station for you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 graphics tablet that has a geforce 640 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.690
 m what makes it very robust running there 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.020
 most of the games on the market here 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.570
 People give the same tablet the ipad 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.229
 running the zone and we can see 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 there he has an attack counted a dock 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.880
 which has two side controls 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.610
 this is also one of the options that the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.580
 edge offers exactly this 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 good accessory and here we give a 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.350
 another option for the eee pad tablet that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.150
 It's still not clear yet. 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.560
 so you have both the version with a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.500
 joystick 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 the keyboard or that version that people 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.320
 previously achieved with the controls 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.840
 on the side 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.759
 in American stores that product 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.649

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.329
 They did advance us here yet there is not 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.030
 expected to launch in other countries 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.570
 and we will have versions with a processor 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.909
 intel core i5 which should cost 999 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.270
 dollars or more or less 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.789
 2,100 reais and a version also with 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 intel core i7 processor and the expected 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.049
 to reach the market for about 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.209
 1300 US dollars which would more or less 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.080
 two thousand and seventy- two thousand and eight hundred 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.319

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.130
