to<00:06:03.449> a<00:06:03.630> phony<00:06:03.960> life

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
to a phony life

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.050 
to a phony life
my<00:06:06.730> heart<00:06:07.120> was<00:06:07.650> never<00:06:08.650> real

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
my heart was never real

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.409 
my heart was never real
I'm<00:06:11.540> sure<00:06:12.080> even<00:06:12.680> what<00:06:12.710> I'm<00:06:13.010> feeling<00:06:13.220> now<00:06:13.460> is

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
I'm sure even what I'm feeling now is

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.760 
I'm sure even what I'm feeling now is
probably<00:06:15.020> all<00:06:15.290> fake

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.310 

what<00:06:18.430> are<00:06:18.520> you<00:06:18.669> feeling

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.370 

what<00:06:21.860> happens<00:06:22.250> when<00:06:22.400> I<00:06:22.460> fake<00:06:22.790> dies<00:06:24.490> unlike<00:06:25.490> me

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
what happens when I fake dies unlike me

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.839 
what happens when I fake dies unlike me
where<00:06:27.380> will<00:06:27.530> my<00:06:27.560> heart<00:06:27.890> go

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.230 

does<00:06:31.449> it<00:06:31.629> disappear

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.020 

it'll<00:06:34.840> go<00:06:34.990> somewhere<00:06:36.900> maybe<00:06:38.669> so<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:39.819> same

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
it'll go somewhere maybe so the same

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.050 
it'll go somewhere maybe so the same
place<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.509> mine

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.600 

a<00:06:44.150> faithful<00:06:44.750> replica<00:06:45.470> until<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.460> very<00:06:46.669> end

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.339 

that's

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
that's

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.349 
that's
okay
