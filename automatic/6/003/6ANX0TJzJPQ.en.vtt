 acquired from a producer 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.320

 in autoclaves this ensures great 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.630
 precision to treatment which means 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.180
 longer life to wood 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.820
 the most used condoms are created 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 which is a soluble oil product that

 gives the treated material this color 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.810
 and the water-soluble salts that give

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.730
 for treatment of small volume of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 wood 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.990
 condoms can be purchased

 simple and safe 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.090
 the sap replacement method 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.729
 maximum cut wood 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.729
 24 hours before treatment 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.100
 the moirões are peeled and have their 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.440
 qualified personnel to increase the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.840
 permeability to solution 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.820
 then placed in drums 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.770
 containing the condom

 winning the pieces until the height of 80 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.580
 centimeters 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.220
 this solution is composed of a mixture 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.450
 of solubles in concentrations 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.790
 variables prepared before the sap 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.670
 present in the cells of the wood begins to 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.310
 evaporate while the condom penetrates 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.000
 by the base of the parts being distributed 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 capillarity this bath lasts eight days 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.620
 at the end of which the moirões are 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.330
 face remaining two days without 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.459
 shower 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.130
 finally the wood is placed to dry 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.500
 the water of the solution will be 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.030
 the interior of the wood but the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.030
 condom will remain 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.150
 the following 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.000
 the copper sulphate which is 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.660
 a fungicide or boric acid which 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.090
 insecticide and sodium dichromate or 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 potassium which has the function of 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.620
 two other sites on wood 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.030
 the second method of treatment 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.260
 used in rural properties is the bath

 pealed and dried until they reach a 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.400
 age of about 30% on the dry basis 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.130
 they are dipped in a condom 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.050
 soluble oil based on creams other 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.650
 heated to 90 degrees 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.080
 This bath lasts at least two hours. 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.870
 At this stage the heating makes the cells 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.300
 expansion of the wood by 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.300
 its interior air and moisture present 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.360
 after the hot bath the pieces are 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.030
 transferred to the other container 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.060
 containing the same condom 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.360
 Only now cold where you should stay for 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.280
 four hours minimum 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.190
 during the cooling process the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.519
 fibrous cells of the wood 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.769
 chamdo preservative to the inside 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.370
 that the others is a product derived from 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.709
 Distillation of the nail is a 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.209
 broad spectrum insecticide and fungicide 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.209
 very efficient
