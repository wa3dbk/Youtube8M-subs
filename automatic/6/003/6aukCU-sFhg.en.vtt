I'm<00:00:01.680> gonna<00:00:01.860> show<00:00:02.010> how<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> convert<00:00:02.370> mental

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
I'm gonna show how to convert mental

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.700 
I'm gonna show how to convert mental
reset<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> gravity<00:00:03.959> bag<00:00:04.110> which<00:00:04.290> makes<00:00:04.529> it

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
reset to a gravity bag which makes it

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.500 
reset to a gravity bag which makes it
easier<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> clean<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.700> blended<00:00:06.390> diet<00:00:06.600> through

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
easier to clean a blended diet through

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.070 
easier to clean a blended diet through
go<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.719> bag

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
go the bag

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.360 
go the bag
and<00:00:10.200> first<00:00:10.559> you're<00:00:10.650> gonna<00:00:10.769> find<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.190> side

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
and first you're gonna find the side

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.459 
and first you're gonna find the side
that<00:00:11.580> has<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.759> little<00:00:12.000> raindrop<00:00:12.929> or<00:00:13.049> teardrop

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
that has the little raindrop or teardrop

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.099 
that has the little raindrop or teardrop
on<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> longer<00:00:14.400> piece<00:00:14.610> right<00:00:14.820> here

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
on it it's the longer piece right here

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.500 
on it it's the longer piece right here
and<00:00:16.109> separate<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.940> rubbery<00:00:17.940> part<00:00:18.210> from<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and separate this rubbery part from the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.040 
and separate this rubbery part from the
hard<00:00:18.720> plastic<00:00:19.250> pull<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> off

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
hard plastic pull it off

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
hard plastic pull it off
we're<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.760> cut<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> tip<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
we're going to do is cut the tip of this

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.920 
we're going to do is cut the tip of this
piece<00:00:24.660> off<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.029> food<00:00:27.240> doesn't<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.599> stuck<00:00:27.779> in

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
piece off so food doesn't get stuck in

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.279 
piece off so food doesn't get stuck in
there

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
there

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.069 
there
it's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> nice<00:00:29.310> big<00:00:30.179> shirt<00:00:30.480> pair<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.810> scissors

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.080 

if<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.230> end<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.820> over<00:00:39.000> my

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
if you end up I have this all over my

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.010 
if you end up I have this all over my
floor<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.480> end<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.920> barbs

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
floor you end up with like little barbs

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.729 
floor you end up with like little barbs
snip<00:00:43.020> those<00:00:43.200> off<00:00:45.350> you're<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
snip those off you're gonna put this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.819 
snip those off you're gonna put this
back<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.809> ease<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.020> back<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.620> pull<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
back on just ease it back on and pull it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.760 
back on just ease it back on and pull it
down<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.850> shirts<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.449> then

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
down your shirts on all the way and then

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
down your shirts on all the way and then
it<00:00:55.770> makes<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> liquid

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it makes it so that if you have a liquid

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.709 
it makes it so that if you have a liquid
like<00:00:59.039> water<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.000> I'm<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.539> running

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
like water in here so I'm really running

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.510 
like water in here so I'm really running
blend<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.500> it'll<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.800> run<00:01:02.010> through<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
blend and it'll just run through it's a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
blend and it'll just run through it's a
gravity<00:01:02.730> bag<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.559> makes<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:04.949> easy

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
gravity bag so it makes it really easy

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
gravity bag so it makes it really easy
to<00:01:05.309> pry<00:01:05.610> them<00:01:05.790> separate<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> bag<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.110> I've

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
to pry them separate the bag and I've

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
to pry them separate the bag and I've
got<00:01:07.350> food<00:01:08.070> coloring<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> water<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
got food coloring in this water so that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
got food coloring in this water so that
you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.840> you'll<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.920> able<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.430> go

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you can see you'll be able to see it go

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.020 
you can see you'll be able to see it go
through

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
through

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
through
I<00:01:14.960> don't<00:01:15.960> normally<00:01:16.259> put<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:16.770> water<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
I don't normally put this much water and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.499 
I don't normally put this much water and
then<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> usually<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.790> add<00:01:18.000> maybe<00:01:18.210> an<00:01:18.390> ounce

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
then I usually just add maybe an ounce

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
then I usually just add maybe an ounce
of<00:01:18.720> water<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.380> prime<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.860> water

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
of water and then I prime it with water

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.380 
of water and then I prime it with water
instead<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.700> her<00:01:20.820> blend<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
instead of with her blend because I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
instead of with her blend because I
think<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.689> easier<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.830> take<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> cap

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
think it's easier you just take the cap

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
think it's easier you just take the cap
off<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:24.270> long<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.960> lower<00:01:25.259> than

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
off as long as you have this lower than

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.640 
off as long as you have this lower than
the<00:01:26.130> bag<00:01:26.390> you've<00:01:27.390> seen<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.720> goes<00:01:27.930> right

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the bag you've seen just goes right

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.200 
the bag you've seen just goes right
through<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.259> basic

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
through there and then just basic

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.399 
through there and then just basic
priming<00:01:33.210> principles<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.320> are

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
priming principles like if you are

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
priming principles like if you are
holding<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> tear<00:01:35.040> drop<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.759> also

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
holding the tear drop down this is also

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
holding the tear drop down this is also
how<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.479> hand<00:01:36.750> Prime<00:01:37.110> you'd<00:01:37.320> hold<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
how you would hand Prime you'd hold the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
how you would hand Prime you'd hold the
if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> didn't<00:01:38.340> modify<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
if you didn't modify it you would just

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.399 
if you didn't modify it you would just
hold<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> tear<00:01:39.600> drop<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> would<00:01:40.920> go

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
hold the tear drop down and it would go

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.780 
hold the tear drop down and it would go
so<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> same<00:01:43.860> theory<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.670> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so that's the same theory about if you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.389 
so that's the same theory about if you
raise<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:46.229> reverse<00:01:46.560> primer<00:01:47.130> put<00:01:47.280> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
raise it up your reverse primer put it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.140 
raise it up your reverse primer put it
back<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.630> bag

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.969 

so<00:01:57.150> when<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.360> feed<00:01:57.570> her<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.900> prime<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> with

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
so when I feed her I just prime it with

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.469 
so when I feed her I just prime it with
water<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.530> put<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> cap<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.150> or<00:02:03.150> put<00:02:03.390> an

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
water and then put the cap on or put an

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.469
