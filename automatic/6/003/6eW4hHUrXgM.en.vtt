00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:11.900
 active mark as friend 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:15.670
 magic of 1965 I have fought in the world 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.670
 whole for the best of the only free 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.700
 until I had a contest that I 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.340
 I was of the stars dancing in 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.860
 telemundo I was with wise the corporal of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 the final two and I did not know that the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.410
 fight fan frees so 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.410
 powerful 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.400
 In U.S.A 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:03.960
 on the 16th a billboard where there was a 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:05.880
 that 11 at the same time 35 30 now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.630
 all the fans the other days 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.829
 first time I did an interview 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.680
 in one day 55,000 people saw her I think 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.340
 that the most seen is yours, I think that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.340
 for a point 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.729
 but the most important thing is that they are 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.470
 Those who were funny to me are me 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.460
 because without mercy for that it gives me as a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 Cook who does not know what might happen 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
 I fly 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.290
 the dramatic received with a hug 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.290
 Talk about it 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.450
 you never know because if you come by 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.930
 there in a moment in something better and only 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.930
 in the bell 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:06.440
 unlike children 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.200
 honestly you are never insulted 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 but 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.659
 carlos open that if I could 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.659
 sleep 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 but nothing more good morning I do not remember 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.090
 that for you is your little mind 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.730
 thinking of the pianitos as carlos 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:26.270
 colombia that is now 67 years old me 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:28.430
 I have 70 that you thought that 200 like 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.320
 we the fanaticada was not going to give the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.890
 support but rather let me tell you 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.900
 basic for seriously caught someone 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.700
 he says that a thousand came that day 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.530
 people to the street under the roof of cagua 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.540
 and they left they could not enter as 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.760
 2000 to see don benito of our age 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.010
 so you can see with good eyesight and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.010
 like the salary of puerto rico I do not want 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.209
 when your work 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.580
 tremendous speaker is your job 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:24.860
 and entertain but sometimes when you want 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:29.420
 humiliate because we are both people 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:33.190
 that the town does not want anyone that I 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:37.340
 I made an approval yesterday in the program 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.600
 and about 125 people but not 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:46.170
 they wrote m money 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:48.540
 is in my heart means that 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.510
 a person like you want me to like 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.540
 entertain to see the whole world manager 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.340
 you should not have anyone who hates those 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.960
 for the things that they do that should 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.380
 do that I think it should not 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.380
 humiliate 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:19.910
 in the same way there are little things that I think 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:19.910
 they will find 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:50.720
 after that it was Aug. 15 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.970
 Marcelo and he works very well 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.030
 10 years 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:14.900
 you always in the Coliseum Antonio 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.960
 barceló de toa is starting the 8 of the 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.960
 night 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.020
 but 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.889
 how 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.889
 to manolo calderón 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:33.619

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:13.290
 in the world 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:17.100
 Sometimes that is not the case 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:19.300
 so it's fine 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.410
 so where can people follow you 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.410

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.350

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.870
