we're<00:00:48.960> trying<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.440> there's<00:00:49.620> some

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we're trying to see if there's some

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.540 
we're trying to see if there's some
recovery<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.550> it's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
recovery we can do but as of now it's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
recovery we can do but as of now it's
just<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.120> um<00:00:54.510> ggl<00:00:55.440> itself<00:00:55.770> remains<00:00:56.100> though

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
just going um ggl itself remains though

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.810 
just going um ggl itself remains though
websites<00:00:57.300> still<00:00:57.510> coming<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.190> we<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.430> an

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
websites still coming back up we have an

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
websites still coming back up we have an
off-site<00:01:00.300> server<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.770> gonna<00:01:01.890> be

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
off-site server which is gonna be

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.880 
off-site server which is gonna be
running<00:01:02.600> backups<00:01:03.600> regularly<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.559> will

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
running backups regularly so this will

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.260 
running backups regularly so this will
not<00:01:05.129> happen<00:01:05.820> again

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
not happen again

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.649 
not happen again
um<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.560> new<00:01:07.799> piece<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.659> security

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
um we also have a new piece of security

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.080 
um we also have a new piece of security
software<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> website<00:01:10.470> called

CloudFlare<00:01:13.729> from<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> understand<00:01:15.299> it's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
CloudFlare from what I understand it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
CloudFlare from what I understand it's

um the two-week time limit that was

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
um the two-week time limit that was
placed<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.220> removed<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.909> its

gonna be allowed to do its own thing the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.090 
gonna be allowed to do its own thing the
reason<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.290> SRP<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
reason for this is because the SRP and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.080 
reason for this is because the SRP and
the<00:01:47.579> TRP<00:01:48.000> servers<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.630> currently<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:50.090> standby

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
or they're in stasis if you will and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.520 
or they're in stasis if you will and
they're<00:01:55.649> gonna<00:01:55.770> remain<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.280> until

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
they're gonna remain that way until

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.719 
they're gonna remain that way until
myself<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.680> whatever<00:01:58.829> directors<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.549> have

myself and whatever directors we have

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.730 
myself and whatever directors we have
have<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> opportunity<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> review<00:02:01.049> them<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
have the opportunity to review them and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980 
have the opportunity to review them and
see<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.180> condense<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> community

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
see if we can condense the community

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
see if we can condense the community
into<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> half-life<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> roleplay<00:02:04.890> community

to bring this into the ggl community um
in<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.400> event<00:03:54.579> they<00:03:54.670> fail<00:03:54.940> we'll<00:03:55.269> figure<00:03:55.570> out

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
in the event they fail we'll figure out

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.509 
in the event they fail we'll figure out
what<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.350> guess<00:03:56.500> consequences<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.459> that

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
what the I guess consequences for that

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.979 
what the I guess consequences for that
will<00:03:57.730> be<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.850> may<00:03:58.030> have<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.239> refund<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.690> cost<00:03:58.720> of

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
will be a may have to refund the cost of

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.050 
will be a may have to refund the cost of
the<00:03:59.049> game<00:03:59.200> or<00:03:59.410> something<00:03:59.650> like<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.829> but<00:04:00.430> the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
the game or something like that but the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.940 
the game or something like that but the
point<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:02.260> will<00:04:02.410> be<00:04:02.530> opening<00:04:02.829> new

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
point is that we will be opening new

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.180 
point is that we will be opening new
positions<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:04.709> obviously<00:04:05.709> we<00:04:05.890> will<00:04:06.040> maintain

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
positions and obviously we will maintain

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.490 
positions and obviously we will maintain
a<00:04:06.400> lot<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.760> positions<00:04:07.030> we<00:04:07.299> already<00:04:07.540> have<00:04:07.720> but

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
a lot of positions we already have but

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.099 
a lot of positions we already have but
there<00:04:09.010> will<00:04:09.160> now<00:04:09.579> be<00:04:09.720> incentives<00:04:10.720> for<00:04:10.989> people

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109
