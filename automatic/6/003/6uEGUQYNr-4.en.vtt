 with makeup just continue to watched in the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.670
 time to tune your nose is after you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 already have your skin completely ready 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 and you will need a brush 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.410
 with lots of bills can be 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
 that your favorite smoking knows 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 choose a powder that has a color one 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.430
 A little above your skin knows a tone 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.170
 above 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 if you want you can also use a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.180
 bronze gets super cool 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
 we always start at the end of the nose 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.020
 from the tip up because at the tip 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.210
 it's a little nose job 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 the wider it is there that goes from the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.650
 know our direction to draw our 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.659
 nose a little thinner and always 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.630
 let's use the brush making movements 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.250
 because it goes there foaming 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 at the same time that it is tuning 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.820
 so we avoid that the appreciation 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.520
 nose gets too stressed and this is the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 main tip pay close attention 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 we will catch up with this potential 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 smoking and is applying our 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 bronze or our little darker than the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 skin on the entire side of the nose 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.939
 we get the tip as I said and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 it goes up to eyebrow always 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.180
 making circular movements 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.530
 this tip that will leave your nose 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.530
 super thin 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.770
 ready was easy on the black pan can 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.780
 assume that this tip you did not imagine 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.850
 it was going to be as easy as it was that you 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.710
 did not even have to have that surgery 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.170
 that you thought you had to 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.109
 do because there is no perfect nose 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.450
 in the world this has already hit the whole nose 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.480
