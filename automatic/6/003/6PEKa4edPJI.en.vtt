your fuel will be flashed on they're

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.630 
your fuel will be flashed on they're
good<00:00:55.439> to<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.220> there<00:00:56.339> are<00:00:56.400> lots<00:00:56.549> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
good to go and there are lots of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.070 
good to go and there are lots of
different<00:00:56.879> supported<00:00:57.269> configurations<00:00:57.839> so

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
different supported configurations so

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.410 
different supported configurations so
custom<00:00:58.710> Tunes<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> new<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.909> get<00:01:00.299> the

run a maximum four point six to four
point<00:01:48.719> seven<00:01:48.899> volts<00:01:49.289> so<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:49.740> hoping<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
point seven volts so we're hoping the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.710 
point seven volts so we're hoping the
working<00:01:50.670> range<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.329> master

working range of the master

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.900 
working range of the master
and<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> mass<00:01:52.980> air<00:01:53.190> flow<00:01:53.220> sensor<00:01:53.400> baby

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
and this is a mass air flow sensor baby

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.120 
and this is a mass air flow sensor baby
-<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:54.900> speakin<00:01:55.320> sea<00:01:55.470> bass<00:01:55.650> -<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.010> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
- it's not a speakin sea bass - so this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
- it's not a speakin sea bass - so this

considering that this car may need to
place<00:02:51.430> 440<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.060> 460<00:02:52.660> stop<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.110> that's<00:02:53.230> a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
place 440 and 460 stop so that's a

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.350 
place 440 and 460 stop so that's a
considerable<00:02:53.770> increase<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.280> 91<00:02:54.640> octane<00:02:54.670> so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
considerable increase on 91 octane so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.030 
considerable increase on 91 octane so
for<00:02:55.540> our<00:02:55.630> second<00:02:55.930> test<00:02:56.080> spirit<00:02:56.500> dsport<00:02:56.920> we

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
for our second test spirit dsport we

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:09.190 
for our second test spirit dsport we
decided<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.460> change<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.820> fuels<00:02:58.090> 200<00:02:58.510> octane

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.250 

so<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.500> switched<00:03:10.740> out<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.250> 91<00:03:12.060> octane<00:03:12.300> for<00:03:12.780> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
so we switched out the 91 octane for a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.470 
so we switched out the 91 octane for a
very<00:03:13.830> high<00:03:13.980> quality<00:03:14.040> 100<00:03:14.640> octane<00:03:14.760> fuel<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
very high quality 100 octane fuel and

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.120 
very high quality 100 octane fuel and
with<00:03:15.690> 100<00:03:15.990> octane<00:03:16.080> fuel<00:03:16.530> we<00:03:16.740> were<00:03:16.830> able<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
with 100 octane fuel we were able to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.040 
with 100 octane fuel we were able to

about<00:03:51.510> ethanol<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.650> burns<00:03:52.830> really<00:03:53.310> slow

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
about ethanol is it burns really slow

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
a lot of fuel volume there so it helps

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.960 
a lot of fuel volume there so it helps
to<00:03:57.390> cool<00:03:57.600> down<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.840> motor<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:59.130> 85<00:03:59.490> is<00:03:59.730> just

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
to cool down the motor the 85 is just

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.030 
to cool down the motor the 85 is just

metropolitan fuels so our final step in
turning<00:04:07.740> this<00:04:07.950> car<00:04:08.130> was<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.670> drain<00:04:09.060> all<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
turning this car was to drain all the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.820 
turning this car was to drain all the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
fuel out which is critically important

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.750 
fuel out which is critically important
because<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.100> want<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> keep<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.550> ethanol

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
because you want to keep the ethanol

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.120 
because you want to keep the ethanol
content<00:04:12.090> as<00:04:12.600> close<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.290> ideal<00:04:13.440> as<00:04:13.710> possible

tricky<00:04:18.780> thing<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.140> tuning<00:04:19.380> for<00:04:19.500> ethanol<00:04:19.739> is

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
tricky thing for tuning for ethanol is

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.370 
tricky thing for tuning for ethanol is
that<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.549> takes<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.820> lot<00:04:21.060> more<00:04:21.090> fuel<00:04:21.690> volume<00:04:21.900> to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that it takes a lot more fuel volume to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.410 
that it takes a lot more fuel volume to
produce<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:23.160> same<00:04:23.340> kind<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.700> power<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
produce the same kind of power the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.150 
produce the same kind of power the
stochiometry<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:25.080> ethanol<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.590> such<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.950> it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
stochiometry of ethanol is such that it

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.370 
stochiometry of ethanol is such that it
requires<00:04:26.430> about<00:04:26.640> 30<00:04:26.910> percent<00:04:27.120> more<00:04:27.390> volume

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
requires about 30 percent more volume

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.500 
requires about 30 percent more volume
compared<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.040> pump<00:04:29.250> pure<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.060> same<00:04:30.270> kind

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
compared to pump pure for the same kind

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.690 
compared to pump pure for the same kind
of<00:04:30.570> power<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.560> really<00:04:31.740> had<00:04:31.950> to<00:04:32.070> lean<00:04:32.400> on<00:04:32.670> our

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
of power so it really had to lean on our

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.560 
of power so it really had to lean on our
tool<00:04:33.060> system

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
tool system

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.240

it's<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.870> upgraded<00:04:34.350> injectors<00:04:34.800> which<00:04:35.070> are<00:04:35.220> a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
it's the upgraded injectors which are a

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 
it's the upgraded injectors which are a
thousand<00:04:35.670> CCS<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.840> upgraded<00:04:37.200> fuel<00:04:37.350> pumps

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
thousand CCS and the upgraded fuel pumps

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.020 
thousand CCS and the upgraded fuel pumps
are<00:04:37.710> absolutely<00:04:38.130> required<00:04:38.280> for<00:04:38.610> ethanol

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
are absolutely required for ethanol

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:52.850 
are absolutely required for ethanol
based<00:04:39.180> tuning

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.439 

so<00:04:53.860> we<00:04:54.069> add<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.580> tiny<00:04:54.789> bit<00:04:54.970> more<00:04:55.180> booze

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
so we add just a tiny bit more booze

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.659 
so we add just a tiny bit more booze
compared<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.780> 100<00:04:56.110> octane<00:04:56.229> again<00:04:57.100> we<00:04:57.250> optimize

drivetrain and the fill pumps themselves

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.010 
drivetrain and the fill pumps themselves
contain<00:05:51.159> a<00:05:51.520> pump<00:05:51.940> fuel<00:05:52.180> from<00:05:52.360> one<00:05:52.539> side<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:52.960> the

contain a pump fuel from one side of the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.800 
contain a pump fuel from one side of the
other<00:05:53.050> with<00:05:53.889> a<00:05:54.220> cycling<00:05:54.729> mechanism<00:05:55.180> that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
other with a cycling mechanism that

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.779 
other with a cycling mechanism that
siphoning<00:05:56.289> mechanism<00:05:56.800> works<00:05:57.039> off<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.490> return

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
siphoning mechanism works off the return

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.700 
siphoning mechanism works off the return
line<00:05:58.060> from<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.509> pump<00:05:58.720> so<00:05:59.020> these<00:05:59.110> are<00:05:59.289> return

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
line from the pump so these are return

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.800 
line from the pump so these are return
based<00:06:00.039> fuel<00:06:00.310> systems<00:06:00.699> so<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.240> extra<00:06:01.570> fuel

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
based fuel systems so the extra fuel

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.689 
based fuel systems so the extra fuel
that<00:06:01.930> comes<00:06:02.080> back<00:06:02.349> from<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.680> engine<00:06:02.979> bay<00:06:03.130> who

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
that comes back from the engine bay who

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.100 
that comes back from the engine bay who
runs<00:06:03.940> through<00:06:04.210> a<00:06:04.240> little<00:06:04.449> venturi<00:06:04.780> which

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
runs through a little venturi which

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.499 
runs through a little venturi which
creates<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.530> suction<00:06:05.740> which<00:06:06.669> pulls<00:06:07.060> fuel<00:06:07.360> from

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
creates a suction which pulls fuel from

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.290 
creates a suction which pulls fuel from
the<00:06:07.630> other<00:06:07.750> side<00:06:07.990> so<00:06:08.830> we<00:06:09.550> have<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.729> be<00:06:09.820> really

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
the other side so we have to be really

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.510 
the other side so we have to be really
careful<00:06:10.479> when<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.530> drain<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.280> fuel<00:06:12.370> from

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
careful when you drain the fuel from

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.680 
careful when you drain the fuel from
these<00:06:12.669> cars<00:06:12.880> you<00:06:13.120> might<00:06:13.150> think<00:06:13.449> when<00:06:13.599> you<00:06:13.659> just

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
these cars you might think when you just

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.749 
these cars you might think when you just
pull<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.050> return<00:06:14.320> line<00:06:14.530> let<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.860> car<00:06:15.039> run<00:06:15.250> you

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
pull the return line let the car run you

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.399 
pull the return line let the car run you
actually<00:06:16.120> can't<00:06:16.330> do<00:06:16.479> that<00:06:16.690> because<00:06:17.289> you're

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
actually can't do that because you're

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.320 
actually can't do that because you're
left<00:06:17.650> with<00:06:17.860> 1/2<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.789> tank<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.120> do<00:06:19.210> the

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
left with 1/2 the tank and do the

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.640 
left with 1/2 the tank and do the
emptied<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.810> because<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.139> siphon<00:06:20.440> didn't

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
emptied and because the siphon didn't

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.930 
emptied and because the siphon didn't
work<00:06:20.770> did<00:06:20.949> their<00:06:21.070> half<00:06:21.219> is<00:06:21.370> completely<00:06:21.789> full

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
work did their half is completely full

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.089 
work did their half is completely full
so<00:06:22.300> what<00:06:23.080> we're<00:06:23.199> going<00:06:23.320> to<00:06:23.380> show<00:06:23.530> you<00:06:23.590> today<00:06:23.710> is

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
so what we're going to show you today is

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.310 
so what we're going to show you today is
a<00:06:24.130> little<00:06:24.460> bit<00:06:24.550> of<00:06:24.699> something<00:06:24.880> that<00:06:25.270> uses<00:06:26.139> that

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
a little bit of something that uses that

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.350 
a little bit of something that uses that
maintains<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.860> cycling<00:06:27.250> system<00:06:27.580> to<00:06:28.210> allow

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
maintains the cycling system to allow

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.560 
maintains the cycling system to allow
you<00:06:28.419> to<00:06:28.509> get<00:06:28.630> all<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.050> fuel<00:06:29.229> out

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.210 

basically<00:06:33.230> like<00:06:33.440> a<00:06:33.470> pressure<00:06:33.740> valve<00:06:33.980> to

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
basically like a pressure valve to

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.500 
basically like a pressure valve to
maintain<00:06:34.610> a<00:06:34.640> certain<00:06:34.850> amount<00:06:35.000> of<00:06:35.090> pressure<00:06:35.270> on

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
maintain a certain amount of pressure on

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.050 
maintain a certain amount of pressure on
the<00:06:35.600> return<00:06:35.870> line<00:06:36.110> this<00:06:36.560> is<00:06:36.740> a<00:06:36.770> walbro<00:06:37.430> 355

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
there we started off with the 85 so even

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.710 
there we started off with the 85 so even
with<00:06:48.590> our<00:06:48.740> best<00:06:48.950> efforts<00:06:49.310> to<00:06:49.460> get<00:06:49.610> dat<00:06:49.850> 505<00:06:50.600> in

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
with our best efforts to get dat 505 in

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.900 
with our best efforts to get dat 505 in
the<00:06:50.780> tank<00:06:51.020> we<00:06:51.260> only<00:06:51.410> ended<00:06:51.650> up<00:06:51.770> with<00:06:51.920> about<00:06:52.010> 79

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
the tank we only ended up with about 79

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.300 
the tank we only ended up with about 79
degree<00:06:53.180> baby<00:06:53.500> if<00:06:54.500> we<00:06:54.620> had<00:06:54.770> to<00:06:54.890> use<00:06:55.010> a<00:06:55.100> siphon

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
degree baby if we had to use a siphon

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.430 
degree baby if we had to use a siphon
then<00:06:55.580> to<00:06:56.090> drain<00:06:56.300> the<00:06:56.390> tank<00:06:56.630> we<00:06:57.260> would<00:06:57.350> have

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
then to drain the tank we would have

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.260 
then to drain the tank we would have
ended<00:06:57.560> up<00:06:57.680> with<00:06:57.740> a<00:06:57.860> much<00:06:58.040> much<00:06:58.250> lower<00:06:58.460> low<00:06:58.790> back

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
ended up with a much much lower low back

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.590 
ended up with a much much lower low back
so<00:06:59.540> it<00:07:00.170> was<00:07:00.290> acceptable<00:07:00.680> not<00:07:01.190> ideal<00:07:01.550> after<00:07:02.480> our

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
so it was acceptable not ideal after our

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.650 
so it was acceptable not ideal after our
tank<00:07:02.840> or<00:07:03.050> two<00:07:03.200> it'll<00:07:03.440> approach<00:07:03.800> 85<00:07:04.550> and<00:07:04.910> when

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
tank or two it'll approach 85 and when

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.270 
tank or two it'll approach 85 and when
it<00:07:05.750> finally<00:07:05.930> gets<00:07:06.170> there<00:07:06.470> the<00:07:06.800> car<00:07:07.010> would<00:07:07.160> be<00:07:07.250> a

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
it finally gets there the car would be a

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.980 
it finally gets there the car would be a
little<00:07:07.760> bit<00:07:07.850> leaner<00:07:08.060> that's<00:07:08.660> okay

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
little bit leaner that's okay

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:22.900 
little bit leaner that's okay
