00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.430
 wishes to all of you guys 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.930
 here we are this time with a video a 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.700
 slightly different from the usual 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.980
 probably those who follow me on the page 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.689
 facebook already knows but I'm going to explain it 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 for those who do not follow me 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.539
 and this you are seeing is a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.339
 program developed by me some burst e 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 other collaborators mainly 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.589
 an idea of zombies best me simply 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.310
 from fon am to making it is a program 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.050
 which will allow all of you to 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.770
 calculate your own emblem 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.100
 Eleky the remaining rate and to move 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.410
 among the zombie emblems of black ops 2 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.990
 unfortunately the rhythm used by the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.340
 activision in this game precisely for 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.420
 attributing zombie emblems is not 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.910
 well defined 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 nobody knows exactly how to calculate the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.270
 operation of this algorithm when 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.730
 we have come close enough to this 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.070
 with very low error rate 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.420
 consequently precisely after many efforts 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 we were able to find algorithms 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 that went a little to align with the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.070
 emblems of black ops 2 and through 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.600
 the data sent by you in fact vi 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.300
 thank you also for this we are 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 managed to implement this program 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.890
 to the grand quickly to explain to you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.330
 functionality as first thing you can 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.280
 see here kills should be inserted a 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.409
 ground their personal data 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.300
 below were advanced options 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.620
 as you see in development because they will be 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.290
 released of the next versions 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.900
 this year he could see the 1.01 blessed la 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.090
 first version what we find the button 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.670
 reset for data and return this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.290
 main screen and episodes calculates 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.720
 to calculate your nose now 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.720
 I will put ample English data at random 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.700
 which is right to make a first calculation 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.790
 as you can see you know by chance it is 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.869
 result was a skull emblem that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.979
 has a radius of 64 63 ee to arrive 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.510
 at risk but the knife then 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.460
 the next embryo will take it 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.960
 about 2,185 kills this has been 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.610
 still he had no rest a speak us 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.810
 unfortunately for now only based on 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.090
 killing times on the ground so it's not 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.830
 we are very precise, however 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.400
 developing and improving by entering 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.019
 also 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.180
 private as well as animations like 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.110
 you can see is also below 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.970
 clicking then it will be possible 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.799
 view a tip related to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.269
 there are many radio stations 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.159
 bands for each stretched band is 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.549
 advice available to help you 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.650
 to move to the next level 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.829
 and there are also some of the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.150
 say signs of some 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.900
 fun inside these 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.680
 tips I urge you to read them or absolute 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.540
 we have some notes 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.780
 important you have to read why 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.639
 are fundamental and finally we have the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.049
 developer button that will allow you 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.170
 to access this small screen 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.680
 with the link to our channels and precisely 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.450
 to say let's get to know each other better and then 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 no kids last thing there 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.730
 reporting error of the case in which 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.470
 the emblem of appear or not 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.030
 match with what you really do 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.129
 black black ops we kindly ask you to 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.799
 report it by clicking here so that 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.290
 we can correct the bands of 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.870
 accrue and consequently return the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.519
 very reliable program unfortunately 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.069
 the data you sent was enough 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.290
 but it is not certain they were not very many 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.150
 because unfortunately after an accurate 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.970
 selection none remained then in all 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.500
 the advanced sent and consequently 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.720
 let's say he still has the program is not 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.310
 well defined we will have to work on it though 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.440
 let's say it's already a good level 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.870
 here you can precisely be entered into 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.090
 automatic all the data and then you can 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.340
 choose your emblem the real not 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.409
 what gives appeared as a result 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.659
 and finally write a comment about it 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.810
 to the tests that happened and one 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.269
 once done by e-mail, it will be 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.919
 sent an email from an address 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.750
 fictitious so your data is al 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.359
 sure not true start anything like 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.799
 you can see now an error has arisen 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.209
 because unfortunately they are not connected to 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.030
 internet and precisely accordingly the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.829
 error screen however just not 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.030
 Your data will be released 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.190
 simply in via fani mail to ours 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.419
 support address and we will provide 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.190
 to correct errors and inter 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.540
 to present the program 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.190
 so guys thank you for the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.870
 support given so far please do 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.669
 download the program to test it and to 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.320
 report your mistakes not please 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.940
 in moments but through the appropriate form 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.529
 you have just seen 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.040
 so no guys thank you 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:31.020
 see you again at the next video 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.020
 hello everyone give me
