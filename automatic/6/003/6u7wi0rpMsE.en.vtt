is but does not work with an execute its
supposed<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.030> doesn't<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:41.459> also

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
supposed to but it doesn't so we also

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.110 
supposed to but it doesn't so we also
have<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.980> ball<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.370> which<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
have the ball you one which is one that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.340 
have the ball you one which is one that
just<00:02:45.239> teleported<00:02:45.630> me<00:02:45.690> over<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.170> as<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
just teleported me over there so as you

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.750 
just teleported me over there so as you
can<00:02:46.410> imagine<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.160> tp2<00:02:47.459> those

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
can imagine it's just a tp2 those

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.120 
can imagine it's just a tp2 those
coordinates<00:02:48.180> clear<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:48.870> give<00:02:49.110> again<00:02:49.410> we

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
coordinates clear and then give again we

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.810 
coordinates clear and then give again we
have<00:02:51.050> didn't<00:02:52.050> mean<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.350> tally<00:02:52.860> which<00:02:53.519> is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
have didn't mean to that tally which is

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.240 
have didn't mean to that tally which is
quite<00:02:54.090> simple<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.590> gives<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.800> some<00:02:55.950> XP

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
quite simple it just gives you some XP

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.560 
quite simple it just gives you some XP
i'm<00:02:56.370> not<00:02:56.519> even<00:02:56.640> i'm<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.330> gonna<00:02:57.420> bother

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.300 
is cool one again this one has a good
few<00:03:02.730> commands<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.800> copy<00:03:05.040> this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
few commands to it so we just copy this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.970 
few commands to it so we just copy this
and<00:03:06.000> paste<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.950> dont<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.959> its<00:03:09.959> bonds<00:03:10.380> some

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
and paste and dont and its bonds some

wither<00:03:11.519> skeletons<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.209> us<00:03:12.300> pretty<00:03:12.840> cool

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
wither skeletons for us pretty cool

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.340 
wither skeletons for us pretty cool
pretty<00:03:13.230> cool<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.510> that's<00:03:15.510> what<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.080> one<00:03:16.319> does

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
pretty cool so that's what this one does

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.030 
pretty cool so that's what this one does
am<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.069> correct<00:03:17.660> no<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.079> bia<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.860> saw

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
am I correct no this one is bia you saw

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.470 
am I correct no this one is bia you saw
me<00:03:20.190> use<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.519> one<00:03:20.670> down<00:03:20.820> in<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.030> clip<00:03:21.269> just

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
me use that one down in the clip just

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.090 
me use that one down in the clip just
before<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.959> that's<00:03:22.260> what<00:03:22.440> gave<00:03:22.620> me<00:03:22.650> three

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
before this that's what gave me three

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.690 
before this that's what gave me three
steak<00:03:23.430> when<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.880> was<00:03:24.120> starving<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:25.530> its<00:03:26.459> kind

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
steak when I was starving and its kind

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.000 
steak when I was starving and its kind
cool<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.720> then<00:03:27.900> we<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.380> one<00:03:28.590> which<00:03:28.620> is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
cool and then we have this one which is

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.460 
cool and then we have this one which is
the<00:03:29.370> endgame<00:03:29.760> spell<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.690> each<00:03:30.930> spell<00:03:31.230> does<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the endgame spell so each spell does a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.440 
the endgame spell so each spell does a
different<00:03:31.860> thing<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.190> works<00:03:32.760> pretty<00:03:33.030> simply

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
different thing and works pretty simply

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.020 
different thing and works pretty simply
this<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.140> system<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.100> saw<00:03:35.280> from<00:03:35.459> simply<00:03:35.760> Sark

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
this is a system I saw from simply Sark

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.660 
this is a system I saw from simply Sark
the<00:03:36.540> clear<00:03:37.019> app<00:03:37.260> player<00:03:37.500> right<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> book<00:03:38.070> 00

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the clear app player right of a book 00

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.699 
the clear app player right of a book 00
with<00:03:38.820> Paige<00:03:39.060> tight<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.079> basically<00:03:40.380> what<00:03:40.590> it's

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
with Paige tight so basically what it's

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.910 
with Paige tight so basically what it's
saying<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.220> clear<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:42.090> write<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> book<00:03:42.900> with<00:03:43.530> I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
saying is clear a write a book with I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.620 
saying is clear a write a book with I
don't<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.730> what<00:03:44.850> these<00:03:44.940> two<00:03:45.090> zeros<00:03:45.329> is<00:03:45.450> I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
don't know what these two zeros is I

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.970 
don't know what these two zeros is I
think<00:03:45.690> I'm<00:03:45.930> presuming<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.650> damage

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
think I'm presuming one is a damage

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.860 
think I'm presuming one is a damage
value<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.310> zero<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.850> i'm<00:03:48.420> not<00:03:48.540> sure<00:03:48.690> where<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
value of zero and i'm not sure where the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.140 
value of zero and i'm not sure where the
second<00:03:49.049> one<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.170> or<00:03:49.980> one<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.579> amount<00:03:50.910> so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
second one is or one of the amount so

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.440 
second one is or one of the amount so
it's<00:03:51.299> not<00:03:51.480> clearing<00:03:51.840> any<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:53.250> rather<00:03:53.519> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it's not clearing any but rather it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.030 
it's not clearing any but rather it
thinks<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.049> because<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.500> finds<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.980> my

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
thinks it is because it finds one in my

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.569 
thinks it is because it finds one in my
inventory<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:57.780> gives<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.859> redstone

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
inventory and it gives the redstone

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.900 
inventory and it gives the redstone
signal<00:04:00.019> like<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.049> did<00:04:01.380> give<00:04:01.590> one<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.640> can

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
signal like it did give one so it can

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.840 
signal like it did give one so it can
activate<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.510> rest<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.870> command<00:04:04.140> blocks

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
activate the rest of the command blocks

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.250 
activate the rest of the command blocks
pretty<00:04:05.850> simple<00:04:06.420> when<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.660> come<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.019> think<00:04:07.200> of

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
pretty simple when you come to think of

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.620 
pretty simple when you come to think of
it<00:04:07.350> but<00:04:07.920> there<00:04:08.130> are<00:04:08.280> some<00:04:08.549> more<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:09.000> depth<00:04:09.329> so

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
it but there are some more in depth so

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.539 
it but there are some more in depth so
if<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.780> want<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.019> get<00:04:10.109> doing<00:04:10.410> with<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.709> some

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
if I want to get doing with this some

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.349 
if I want to get doing with this some
