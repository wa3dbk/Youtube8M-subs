hi everyone today I would like to show

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.259 
hi everyone today I would like to show
you<00:00:05.700> how<00:00:05.939> to<00:00:05.970> draw<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.540> dolphin<00:00:07.400> we<00:00:08.400> start<00:00:08.760> by

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
you how to draw a dolphin we start by

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.500 
you how to draw a dolphin we start by
drawing<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:09.809> guidelines<00:00:10.650> first<00:00:11.430> we<00:00:12.060> draw<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
drawing some guidelines first we draw a

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.160 
drawing some guidelines first we draw a
circle<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.260> help<00:00:13.500> us<00:00:13.710> draw<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.100> Dolphins<00:00:14.730> head

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
circle to help us draw the Dolphins head

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.079 
circle to help us draw the Dolphins head
then<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.379> draw<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.770> straight<00:00:17.070> line<00:00:17.100> from<00:00:17.400> under

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:18.089 
then we draw a straight line from under

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.640 
then we draw a straight line from under
the<00:00:18.269> circle<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.650> there<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.990> then<00:00:21.990> draw

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the circle to about there and then draw

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.249 
the circle to about there and then draw
a<00:00:22.679> slightly<00:00:23.339> curved<00:00:23.640> line<00:00:24.089> towards<00:00:24.839> the<00:00:25.019> top

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
a slightly curved line towards the top

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.790 
a slightly curved line towards the top
part<00:00:25.589> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.130> circle<00:00:26.929> that<00:00:27.929> looks<00:00:28.230> somewhat

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
part of the circle that looks somewhat

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.999 
part of the circle that looks somewhat
like<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.310> dolphins<00:00:29.789> body<00:00:30.169> we<00:00:31.169> will<00:00:31.349> refine<00:00:31.829> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
like the dolphins body we will refine it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.900 
like the dolphins body we will refine it
later<00:00:32.220> on

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
later on

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.250 
later on
now<00:00:33.690> draw<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.379> winding<00:00:35.010> crescent<00:00:35.670> moon<00:00:36.120> shape

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
now draw our winding crescent moon shape

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.540 
now draw our winding crescent moon shape
here<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> Dolphins<00:00:38.430> tail<00:00:39.180> fluke<00:00:40.489> now<00:00:41.489> we

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
here for the Dolphins tail fluke now we

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
here for the Dolphins tail fluke now we
can<00:00:41.850> start<00:00:42.120> drawing<00:00:42.890> let's<00:00:43.890> draw<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
can start drawing let's draw the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.810 
can start drawing let's draw the
Dolphins<00:00:44.789> upper<00:00:45.269> beak<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:50.670> we

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
Dolphins upper beak like so and then we

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.110 
Dolphins upper beak like so and then we
toward<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.300> lower<00:00:51.570> beak<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:55.820> draw<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
toward a lower beak like this draw a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.709 
toward a lower beak like this draw a
curved<00:00:57.449> line<00:00:58.019> for<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> cheek<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.449> draw<00:01:00.449> an

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
curved line for the cheek and draw an

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.610 
curved line for the cheek and draw an
oval<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.649> eye<00:01:02.600> draw<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.929> curved<00:01:04.350> line

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
oval for the eye draw a curved line

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
oval for the eye draw a curved line
inside<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> iris<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> draw<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:08.280> small

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.859 
inside for the iris and draw a small
oval<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> pupil<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.909> we<00:01:11.909> draw<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.450> smaller

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
oval for the pupil and we draw a smaller

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
oval for the pupil and we draw a smaller
oval<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.890> show<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> highlight<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.030> the

beak<00:01:19.700> draw<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.030> curved<00:01:21.329> line<00:01:21.630> all<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
beak draw a curved line all the way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.179 
beak draw a curved line all the way
towards<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.520> tail<00:01:23.970> fluke<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.130> draw<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
towards the tail fluke and draw the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.370 
towards the tail fluke and draw the
fluke<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:31.729> from<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.149> draw<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

curved<00:01:34.770> line<00:01:35.219> all<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.030> back<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
curved line all the way back to the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.250 
curved line all the way back to the
dolphin<00:01:37.380> speak<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.520> complete<00:01:38.969> its<00:01:39.329> body

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.910 

now<00:01:46.260> we<00:01:46.320> draw<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> dorsal<00:01:47.370> fin<00:01:47.400> on<00:01:47.820> top<00:01:49.700> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
now we draw the dorsal fin on top and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
now we draw the dorsal fin on top and
add<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.190> flipper<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.330> side<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
add a flipper on this side of the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160 
add a flipper on this side of the
dolphin<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:56.330> another<00:01:57.330> one<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.050> other
