00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
though that the different types of seed

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.420 
though that the different types of seed
packets<00:03:43.060> will<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:43.600> different<00:03:43.810> information

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
packets will have different information

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.500 
packets will have different information
depending<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.920> seed<00:03:48.160> company<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.360> your

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
depending on the seed company so do your

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.199 
depending on the seed company so do your
homework<00:03:49.709> kind<00:03:50.709> of<00:03:50.800> find<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.190> what<00:03:51.550> maybe<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
homework kind of find out what maybe you

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.630 
homework kind of find out what maybe you
want<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.540> grow<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.900> try<00:03:53.080> a<00:03:53.110> few<00:03:53.410> things<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:54.010> see

want to grow and try a few things to see

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.660 
want to grow and try a few things to see
but<00:03:54.820> i<00:03:54.850> do<00:03:54.970> really<00:03:55.390> recommend<00:03:55.989> getting

but i do really recommend getting
getting<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> Richters<00:03:58.180> catalog<00:03:58.600> or<00:03:58.720> at<00:03:58.780> least

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
getting the Richters catalog or at least

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.960 
getting the Richters catalog or at least
getting<00:03:59.140> online<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.860> looking<00:04:00.550> around<00:04:00.670> their

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
getting online and looking around their

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.970 
getting online and looking around their
site<00:04:01.209> because<00:04:01.510> they<00:04:01.630> do<00:04:01.690> have<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:02.709> quite<00:04:02.950> a
