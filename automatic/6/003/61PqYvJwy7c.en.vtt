 it is the heart of the country in a beat 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.890

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.650
 a people that opted for socialism 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.350

 the fight goes on and on 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.330
 but the field 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.790

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.280

 elect you just talked on the balcony 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.040
 of the village in the miraflores palace and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.410
 tell the country and the world what 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.930
 Venezuela had to decide in a moment 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.239
 as today an electoral process was held 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.400
 and the revolution triumphed again today 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.910
 we have an elected president who 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.910
 called Nicolas Nino mature Moros listen to him 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.549
 Now, as the song says, I swear 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.310
 and the people went and fulfilled the oath 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.670
 that he did to the commander hugo chávez on 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.560
 national electoral council in a 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.170
 statement that he has said is 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.410
 irreversible today 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.440
 proclaimed the electoral victory of 1 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.120
 mature nicholas over victory 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.310
 by henrique capriles radonski up 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.390
 now we have to report that aside 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.500
 of everything we've seen 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.310
 president nicolás maduro beech 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.310
 directed to the country 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.310
 good 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.540
 I have asserted I have made see your position 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.730
 before this electoral event he also accepted 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.620
 a proposal from one of the rectors of the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.200
 national electoral council to count 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.930
 completely the voting records and 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.790
 then we saw the ignorance of 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.800
 electoral result on behalf of 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.050
 candidate of the henrique opposition 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.120
 capriles radonski was a position that 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.580
 and he was also sung was 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.220
 announced came preparing the command 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.270
 from the right for this ignorance 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.680
 but the Venezuelan people are like 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.430
 the president said as he did 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.609
 our authority in peace 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.190
 already as an electoral victory decreed 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.799
 by the national electoral council and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.570
 good looking forward to that in the next 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.270
 in the next few hours that 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.400
 total count that will not vary the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.720
 electoral result but well let's 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.870
 see what you think you are here has been 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.360
 said we should speak good to me every 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.580
 year the first thing to say about this 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.900
 result numerically of course 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.880
 means a topic to analyze the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.639
 mature nicolás president already said it in 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.060
 his first intervention that contains a 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.949
 message set to the Venezuelan people 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.550
 in general to the political leadership to the 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.400
 Venezuelan revolution how closed this 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:03.070
 of this triumph but triumph without a doubt 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.259
 clear irreversible is that 44 46 by 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.169
 percent because he remembered remember we already 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.500
 it counted 54 percent of what 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.630
 It is less than half 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.670
 because I've been history to 6 recount 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:22.520
 then he tells us that there is a victory 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:26.850
 clear and 1.6 points almost 300,000 votes 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.220
 henrique capriles won with 45,000 votes 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.940
 the state governor miranda in 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.080
 last December that is to say that they were 3.8 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.120
 almost four points and elías jaua at 15 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.650
 minutes went on national television and 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.660
 recognized the triumph those are the 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.960
 attitudes that we have to start at 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.050
 measure because also in your message be 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.490
 while mature reflects no peace if 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.840
 you can not negotiate a victory 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.360
 electoral because it means delegitimize 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.430
 the victory of legitimizing democracy and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.560
 of the electoral system editor 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.210
 poses an open discussion and a 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.190
 open debate in the country respectful 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.280
 mature raises the need for 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.720
 let's discuss when we do not have to 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.980
 understand us understand when we have 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.390
 what to differentiate but here is a 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.100
 country project to which a project of 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.460
 revolution and a constitution project 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:18.160
 while while mature says that 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.050
 then the speech of capiles is that 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.780
 mature and legitimate that follows 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.790
 considering legitimate that is to say it gives way to 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.450
 what we talked about there is a strategy 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:31.060
 aimed at destabilizing by way of 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.380
 illegitimate legitimize the triumph of 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.000
 Nicolás matures the Bolivarian revolution 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.610
 today for every contest 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.410
 democratic is won you lose the one that 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.360
 lost by one vote lost and the one that won 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.850
 for one vote he won that is democracy 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.930
 current for that it goes precisely to that 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.090
 type of events 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.430
 now you have to remember here for example 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.560
 that in the fourth republic the doctor 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.750
 Rafael Caldera won the elections 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.720
 gonzalo barrios I think that for less than 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.430
 100,000 votes and yet there was a 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.260
 recognition again and there can be 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.840
 trauma because there is simply a 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.480
 referee who counted a few votes and you have to 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.300
 give the referee credit for that is 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.890
 an important part of the 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.890
 institutionality is a state
