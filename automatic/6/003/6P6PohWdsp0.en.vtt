I know there's an awful lot of you out
there<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.120> surfcasting<00:00:03.389> land<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:05.009> really

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
there in surfcasting land have really

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.190 
there in surfcasting land have really
liked<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.850> idea<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.299> try<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.660> break<00:00:06.990> away

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
liked the idea of try and break away

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.560 
liked the idea of try and break away
leads<00:00:07.589> but<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.460> can't<00:00:08.820> justify<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
leads but you just can't justify the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.440 
leads but you just can't justify the
price<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.230> having<00:00:10.530> them<00:00:10.650> shipped<00:00:11.179> well<00:00:12.179> maybe

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
price of having them shipped well maybe

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.509 
price of having them shipped well maybe
there's<00:00:12.719> an<00:00:12.840> answer<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.980> break<00:00:14.309> away

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
there's an answer because break away

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.369 
there's an answer because break away

much<00:00:38.040> better<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:39.420> fishing<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
much better for fishing when you have to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.660 
much better for fishing when you have to
anchor<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.890> bait<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> seabed<00:00:43.670> obviously

this<00:00:44.879> weighs<00:00:45.180> almost<00:00:45.450> nothing<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.770> could<00:00:47.010> put

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
this weighs almost nothing you could put

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
this weighs almost nothing you could put
a<00:00:47.280> hundred<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> parcel<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a hundred of these into a parcel and

a hundred of these into a parcel and
ship<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.469> across<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.160> less<00:00:50.370> than<00:00:50.760> the

ship them across for less than the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
ship them across for less than the
airmail<00:00:52.079> price<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:53.160> five<00:00:53.789> layers<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
airmail price of about five layers I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.049 
airmail price of about five layers I
would<00:00:54.539> imagine<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.370> course<00:00:56.370> there's<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> big

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
would imagine of course there's the big

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.180 
would imagine of course there's the big
question<00:00:57.660> isn't<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.050> how<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> make<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
question isn't that how do you make the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.209 
question isn't that how do you make the
LED<00:00:59.399> body<00:01:00.530> breakaway<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> thought<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
LED body breakaway of thought of that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.890 
LED body breakaway of thought of that
one<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.609> well

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.929 

well<00:01:06.900> here's<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> answer<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> new

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
well here's the answer it's the new

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.780 
well here's the answer it's the new
breakaway<00:01:09.570> system<00:01:09.960> mold<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.220> used<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
breakaway system mold and it's used to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.940 
breakaway system mold and it's used to
make<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.299> LED<00:01:12.510> bodies<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.290> fit<00:01:13.560> onto<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
make the LED bodies that fit onto the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.179 
make the LED bodies that fit onto the
plastic<00:01:14.250> modules<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.530> nice<00:01:16.740> simple

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
plastic modules it's a very nice simple

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.170 
plastic modules it's a very nice simple
mold<00:01:18.049> hinge<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.259> open<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.520> make<00:01:20.880> two

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
mold hinge is open you can make two

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.630 
mold hinge is open you can make two
sizes<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> lead<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> 150<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
sizes of lead with it the 150 and the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.390 
sizes of lead with it the 150 and the
170<00:01:24.420> gram<00:01:26.180> close<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:29.210> put<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> clamp<00:01:30.689> on

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
170 gram close it up put the clamp on

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.929 
170 gram close it up put the clamp on
and<00:01:32.630> then<00:01:33.979> push<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.250> spigot<00:01:37.369> down<00:01:38.369> into<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and then push this spigot down into the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.020 
and then push this spigot down into the
hole<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> next<00:01:40.530> move<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.280> pour<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
hole now the next move is to pour in the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.639 
hole now the next move is to pour in the
lead<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.750> not<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
lead and I'm not going to do that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.950 
lead and I'm not going to do that
because<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> burn<00:01:44.759> myself

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
because I don't want to burn myself

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
because I don't want to burn myself
while<00:01:45.960> I'm<00:01:46.079> trying<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> work<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.860> video<00:01:47.130> camera

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
while I'm trying to work a video camera

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
while I'm trying to work a video camera
at<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> same<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.079> let's<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:49.770> our

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
at the same time so let's use our

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
at the same time so let's use our
imagination<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> go

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
imagination here we go

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.690 
imagination here we go
pour<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.500> leg

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.190 

I've<00:02:00.700> poured<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.179> lead<00:02:01.359> and<00:02:01.630> let<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.960> mold

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
I've poured the lead and let the mold

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.819 
I've poured the lead and let the mold
cool

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
cool

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:12.050 
cool
so<00:02:03.219> I'm<00:02:03.939> click<00:02:05.909> open<00:02:06.909> here<00:02:08.549> pull<00:02:09.549> out<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.879> lid

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.890 

now<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.629> take<00:02:13.959> out<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.849> spigot<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.120> we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
now we just take out a spigot and we

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.070 
now we just take out a spigot and we
break<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.640> piece<00:02:19.000> off<00:02:19.269> break<00:02:19.870> away

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
break this piece off break away

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.170 
break this piece off break away
recommend<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.040> twist<00:02:21.489> them<00:02:21.700> off<00:02:21.849> rather

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
recommend that you twist them off rather

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.130 
recommend that you twist them off rather
than<00:02:22.510> cut<00:02:22.840> them<00:02:23.849> okay<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:24.879> now<00:02:25.360> all<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.690> need<00:02:25.870> is

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
than cut them okay so now all we need is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.640 
than cut them okay so now all we need is
our<00:02:26.379> little<00:02:26.709> module<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:28.450> thread<00:02:28.810> onto<00:02:29.290> there

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
our little module we thread onto there

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.460 
our little module we thread onto there
and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.129> we'll<00:02:30.310> push<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.180> hard<00:02:31.450> I'm<00:02:32.079> not

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
and then we'll push that in hard I'm not

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.080 
and then we'll push that in hard I'm not
going<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:33.069> that<00:02:33.250> now<00:02:33.519> because<00:02:33.849> I'll<00:02:33.970> never

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
going to do that now because I'll never

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.539 
going to do that now because I'll never
get<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.450> off<00:02:34.629> again<00:02:34.989> but<00:02:35.920> here's<00:02:36.190> one<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.430> did

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
get that off again but here's one I did

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.780 
get that off again but here's one I did
earlier<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.329> just<00:02:37.989> push<00:02:38.500> down<00:02:38.530> right<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
earlier you just push down right to the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.170 
earlier you just push down right to the
bottom<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.870> let<00:02:41.230> capsule<00:02:42.099> is<00:02:42.730> into

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
bottom so that the let capsule is into

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.460 
bottom so that the let capsule is into
the<00:02:43.299> bottom<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.970> nose<00:02:46.120> cone<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.720> that

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the bottom of the nose cone and that

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.229 
the bottom of the nose cone and that
leaves<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.920> one<00:02:48.040> more<00:02:48.400> thing<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.819> do<00:02:49.000> and

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
leaves just one more thing to do and

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.780 
leaves just one more thing to do and
that<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:49.989> put<00:02:50.410> on<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.660> locking<00:02:52.660> tab<00:02:52.959> on<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
that is to put on the locking tab on the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:08.020 
that is to put on the locking tab on the
back<00:02:55.799> that's<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:57.150> that's<00:02:58.150> your<00:02:58.329> LED<00:02:58.599> complete

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.090
