00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.599 
with you quickly see her pants were
still<00:01:54.349> on<00:01:54.469> so<00:01:54.649> we<00:01:54.799> didn't<00:01:54.979> get<00:01:55.069> any<00:01:55.459> good

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
still on so we didn't get any good

quite an image to the front of the
vehicle<00:01:59.479> i<00:01:59.719> think<00:01:59.929> they're<00:02:00.020> both<00:02:00.140> lucky<00:02:00.469> to<00:02:00.500> be

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649

vehicle i think they're both lucky to be
alive<00:02:00.709> or<00:02:00.979> anything<00:02:01.219> ah<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:02.539> vehicles<00:02:03.229> are

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
alive or anything ah that vehicles are

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.559 
alive or anything ah that vehicles are
designed<00:02:03.379> to<00:02:03.979> collapse<00:02:04.489> I<00:02:04.879> think<00:02:05.299> they've

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
designed to collapse I think they've

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.389 
designed to collapse I think they've
built<00:02:05.869> them<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.140> be<00:02:06.259> have<00:02:06.469> collapsed<00:02:06.799> owns<00:02:07.129> in

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
built them to be have collapsed owns in

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.309 
built them to be have collapsed owns in
them<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.700> they<00:02:07.819> have<00:02:08.209> soared<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.660> impact<00:02:09.079> it's

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
them so they have soared the impact it's

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.569 
them so they have soared the impact it's
certainly<00:02:09.619> what<00:02:09.769> happened<00:02:10.069> yes<00:02:10.250> that's

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
certainly what happened yes that's

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.210 
certainly what happened yes that's
exactly<00:02:10.849> what<00:02:11.329> happened<00:02:11.690> here<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.769> airbags

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
exactly what happened here the airbags

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.280 
exactly what happened here the airbags

protected her upper body her seat belt
was<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.340> she<00:02:16.400> was<00:02:16.609> held<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:16.940> place<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:18.049> the

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
was on so she was held in place if the

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.099 
was on so she was held in place if the
floor<00:02:19.250> pan<00:02:19.459> hadn't<00:02:19.819> been<00:02:19.910> knocked<00:02:20.120> loose<00:02:20.390> she

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.020 
floor pan hadn't been knocked loose she
could<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.349> probably<00:02:21.549> got<00:02:22.549> out<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.849> car

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
could have probably got out of the car

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.059 
could have probably got out of the car
on<00:02:23.120> her<00:02:23.180> own<00:02:23.359> Wow<00:02:23.870> she<00:02:24.319> was<00:02:24.440> just<00:02:24.470> trapped<00:02:24.859> by

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
on her own Wow she was just trapped by

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.569 
on her own Wow she was just trapped by
her<00:02:25.220> her<00:02:25.640> right<00:02:25.910> foot<00:02:26.209> but<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.079> was<00:02:27.170> bought<00:02:27.410> in

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
her her right foot but it was bought in

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.309 
her her right foot but it was bought in
quite<00:02:28.579> a<00:02:28.609> lengthy<00:02:28.940> excitation<00:02:29.870> because<00:02:30.139> of

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
quite a lengthy excitation because of

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.629 
quite a lengthy excitation because of
the<00:02:30.380> way<00:02:30.500> her<00:02:30.620> foot<00:02:30.829> was<00:02:30.950> entangled<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.489> the

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
the way her foot was entangled with the

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.330 
the way her foot was entangled with the
metal<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.269> maybe<00:02:32.510> they'll<00:02:33.109> make<00:02:33.410> some<00:02:34.010> design

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
metal so maybe they'll make some design

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.670 
metal so maybe they'll make some design
changes<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.540> newer<00:02:35.690> models<00:02:36.200> are<00:02:36.349> starting<00:02:36.650> to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
changes the newer models are starting to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.289 
changes the newer models are starting to
incorporate<00:02:36.799> some<00:02:37.340> changes<00:02:37.819> they've<00:02:38.030> started

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
incorporate some changes they've started

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.849 
incorporate some changes they've started
to<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.660> in<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.870> testing<00:02:39.319> for<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.709> and

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
to do in the testing for it and

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.620 
to do in the testing for it and
everything<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.760> hopefully<00:02:41.000> we're<00:02:41.329> going<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
everything so hopefully we're going to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.390 
everything so hopefully we're going to
see<00:02:42.079> some<00:02:42.230> improvements<00:02:42.829> in<00:02:42.919> the<00:02:43.040> design<00:02:43.370> on

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
see some improvements in the design on

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.449 
see some improvements in the design on
