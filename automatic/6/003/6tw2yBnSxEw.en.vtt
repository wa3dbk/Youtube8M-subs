00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello friends with you i am a brand and you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.969
 look in the attic of the show which I will 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.250
 tell you about not the most popular 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.859
 both retro games and new ones 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.430
 somehow bypassed us and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.710
 I want to start a cycle of my videos from the game about 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 which i myself but u quite recently 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.779
 but she just hit me with her 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.000
 qualities name to all creation mighty 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.829
 switch force 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.460
 released data good company way 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.950
 forward technologies December 22, 2011 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 for nintendo 3ds console 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.850
 and in November 2012 she got to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 the form 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.010
 did not differ only wish graphics 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 this game is a two-dimensional 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.059
 platformer with puzzle elements are 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.850
 which is to capture the prisoner 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.969
 escaped during the transportation of the main character 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.940
 name is patrician wagon and she 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.149
 cyborg cop and such a gentle copy 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.149
 robocop 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.350
 she has a good gunshot 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 weapons and also has the ability 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.190
 reposition certain blocks 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.980
 for the sake of yes i am them to the background or creating from them 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.530
 platform on this principle and built 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.350
 most of the puzzles in the game sound 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.240
 just but levels go into such blocks 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.490
 getting bigger and they all 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.160
 its properties so over time 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.680
 the complexity of the game will increase in total 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.150
 the game has 16 main levels and 5 bonus 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.850
 which came out later as 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.420
 free bios and they are passed 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.370
 an average of 5 to 15 minutes each but not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.190
 it is worth being upset that the game 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.550
 so short because of its passage 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.580
 can not be treated several times in each 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.860
 of the levels there is a record which at first 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.200
 it may seem impossible at all 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.480
 beat and right there really need 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.150
 try to choose the most profitable 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.160
 route of passage as well as memorize 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.010
 fumbled her solutions each of the puzzles 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.110
 to get to the finish as quickly as possible 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.410
 this is not earn this fucking 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.630
 star and if you collect them all in 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.850
 As a bonus, you will be shown a heroine without 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 Forms it does not justify the enclosed 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.650
 squinted each 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.020
 and at the metro and getta aka tilla graphics in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.900
 the game is made in pixel style and it 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.459
 just awesome all sprites 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.340
 just drawn 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.920
 10 out of 10 and their animation is just 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.780
 great well so many times i played in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.150
 games and forward and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.370
 I was always amazed at the quality of their graphics and 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.400
 this game has become an exception for me 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.170
 the same can be said about the design of the world 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.590
 he also worked to the smallest 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.630
 details and perfectly conveys the atmosphere 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.000
 I think the futuristic city is worth 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.489
 already mention and see the version for view 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.250
 their graphics are already much higher 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.770
 resolution and can be compared for example 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.590
 with so tls remaster as fulfilled 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.970
 they are in the same style but honestly pixels 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.690
 I like more for the music answered 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.640
 composer jacob and he's just a genius 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.680
 because he managed to create the best 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.650
 Soundtracks I've heard over the past 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.650
 a couple of years don't believe until you hear the advice 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.400
 Well, I personally like it very much and 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 this is not the only good composition in 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.280
 the game 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.500
 here he is all track about this 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.590
 same level and it can not but rejoice 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.900
 also June 2013 for 3ds came out 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.320
 continuation called miley switch 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.450
 force 2 which was different from 1 nearby 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.080
 innovations and slightly modified 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.690
 gameplay 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.880
 and caused by the fact that our heroine 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.300
 changed her profession and now she doesn't 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.940
 policeman and fireman and since now 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.400
 they and her hometown is threatened by fire 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.310
 by all means trying to prevent it 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.890
 incidentally saving the locals instead 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.590
 the heroine's pistol is now carrying herself 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.200
 small hydraulic pump is great as the thirtieth 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.450
 called infinite supply of water and 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.640
 already with it will overcome 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.830
 obstacles and solve puzzles which 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.310
 now become much more difficult and they are solved 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.169
 no longer so elementary except girls on 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.360
 each level is good now 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.479
 hidden and baby if we find we 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.780
 save the view all the songs and of course you can 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.410
 call salvation then we finally dude 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.620
 play for the patrician of her zero suit 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.030
 the game is also all 16 levels and 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.820
 passage takes about the same 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.100
 time and graphics and music a lot 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.950
 I will not say only what they say 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.380
 still chic version for value 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.520
 this time has done without hd 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.130
 redrawing at the moment gaming 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.380
 the market is saturated with all kinds of unplayable 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.250
 meditation which is trying to impersonate itself 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.140
 for retro in fact they are 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.060
 just another mistake of incompetent people 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.660
 who are not able to come up with something 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.090
 its 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.400
 but sometimes there are still exceptions and 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.370
 mighty switch force is definitely one of 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.770
 such and this game just like everyone 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.409
 lovers of old school retro platformers 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.599
 and if u will 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.779
 Behave yourself a portable from 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.489
 nintendo or so already 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.519
 equal for some mystical reasons 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:48.439
 not yet familiar with this game then i 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:50.029
 I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.029
 with her now 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.489
