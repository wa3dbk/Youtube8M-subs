 the above as well as modern 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.900
 the graphics were as homely 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.769
 First part

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.120
 takes close ups and drives off in battle 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.400
 backwards 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.710
 the judge the day of the battle did not change at all as in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860
 the first part we explore the huge 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.280
 dungeon in search of treasure pumped 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.190
 characters and performing hundreds 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.790
 assignments 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.520
 the truth is now the banner of 1 satellite three and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.050
 it's much easier to manage them 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.059
 battles take place in real time but 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.500
 ktm battle rather slow in addition 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.650
 at any time you can put the game on 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.050
 pause 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 for the role component can not 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 worry 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.270
 not without reason there is a stamp on the game box 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.080
 from the creators of Tula Yamsky who ph 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.940
 author assured that the intimate 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.750
 conversations you spend no less 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.160
 time than the bloody battles of each 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.540
 character has his own story which he 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.600
 dreams to share or their problems 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.550
 which he needs to help resolve 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.840
 will have to talk even the most 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.070
 notorious villains if you lead 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 the conversation is right then many conflicts 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.460
 can be solved by the world 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.880
 so that the game does not get lost among 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.799
 other arpa g developers 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.940
 put up some exotic 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.550
 entertainment for example in the middle of the game we 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.670
 become owners 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.070
 present castle unfortunately fortress 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.570
 I am very different from a pile of stones to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.049
 bring her to a decent look 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.000
 It is necessary to master mini games 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.509
 name in the name of the workers and foreman 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.630
 but then there will be no release from those who wish 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.050
 settle in this masterpiece village 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.760
 architecture 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.350
 I would also like to mention the possibility 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.000
 study artisans want 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 become professional 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.550
 Kuznetsova or the famous 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.989
 alchemist please 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.719
 the game comes with a handy program 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.840
 editor in which as before you can 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.409
 create your own module 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.120
 The editor is very powerful and flexible 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.469
 working with him is a pleasure to 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.689
 draw simple 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:23.730
 dungeons with traps 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.829
 treasure enough half an hour 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.180
 two mouse clicks and really reach the most 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.370
 amazing results for example 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.340
 turn honored hurricane or 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.879
 repaint the sky the color of blood then 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.230
 connect to the network and watch how 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.699
