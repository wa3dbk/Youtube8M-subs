and some kind of card

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.400 
and some kind of card
I<00:03:08.850> guess<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.390> model<00:03:09.750> number<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.230> everything

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
I guess the model number and everything

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.250 
I guess the model number and everything
if<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> probably<00:03:11.580> for<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.760> warranty

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
if you have a probably for the warranty

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.900 
if you have a probably for the warranty
so<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.770> have<00:03:13.890> an<00:03:14.010> issue<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.550> helmet

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
so if you have an issue with the helmet

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.700 
so if you have an issue with the helmet
I<00:03:15.030> guess<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.690> card<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.080> use<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.470> call

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
I guess this is the card you use to call

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.320 
I guess this is the card you use to call
them<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.130> give<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> information<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
them and give the information for the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.990 
them and give the information for the
warranty<00:03:19.280> which<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.460> pretty<00:03:20.730> good<00:03:20.820> idea

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
warranty which is a pretty good idea

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.410 
warranty which is a pretty good idea
okay<00:03:24.000> some<00:03:24.210> more<00:03:24.390> instructions<00:03:26.420> here's

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
okay some more instructions here's

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.900 
okay some more instructions here's
something<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.840> found<00:03:28.020> very<00:03:28.140> interesting<00:03:28.910> okay

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
something I found very interesting okay

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.740 
something I found very interesting okay
this<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.330> some<00:03:31.110> kind<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.520> oil<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.910> you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
this is some kind of oil that you

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.580 
this is some kind of oil that you
applied<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.470> gasket<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:37.410> when<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
applied to the gasket and when I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.680 
applied to the gasket and when I
understand<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:39.090> plate

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
understand the plate

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.320 
understand the plate
so<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> gaskets<00:03:40.680> around<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:43.260> top<00:03:44.330> so

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
so the gaskets around here and on top so

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.180 
so the gaskets around here and on top so
this<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.990> gaskets<00:03:46.410> don't<00:03:46.590> dry<00:03:46.830> out<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.130> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
this the gaskets don't dry out and you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.330 
this the gaskets don't dry out and you
have<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> good<00:03:47.610> seal<00:03:48.050> now<00:03:49.050> if<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.709> understand

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
have a good seal now if I understand

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.440 
have a good seal now if I understand
also<00:03:50.730> from<00:03:50.970> my<00:03:51.180> research<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.709> visor<00:03:53.450> is

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
also from my research that the visor is

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.560 
also from my research that the visor is
all<00:03:54.690> anti<00:03:55.080> scratch<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.770> Anti<00:03:56.370> Fog<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:57.480> I've

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
all anti scratch and Anti Fog and I've

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.720 
all anti scratch and Anti Fog and I've
heard<00:03:57.810> from<00:03:57.990> other<00:03:58.230> people<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.430> anti

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
heard from other people that the anti

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.229 
heard from other people that the anti
form<00:04:00.060> doesn't<00:04:00.450> work<00:04:00.600> very<00:04:00.630> well<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.880> works

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
form doesn't work very well but it works

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.570 
form doesn't work very well but it works
but<00:04:03.720> what<00:04:03.930> happens<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.470> instead<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.220> getting

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
but what happens is instead of getting

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.440 
but what happens is instead of getting
foggy<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.900> get<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.110> condensation<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.190> water<00:04:08.450> on

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
foggy you get a condensation of water on

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.990 
foggy you get a condensation of water on
it<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.680> don't<00:04:10.890> know<00:04:11.130> yet<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:11.820> haven't

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
it so I don't know yet because I haven't

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.940 
it so I don't know yet because I haven't
took<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.660> taking<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.230> out<00:04:13.320> on<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> road<00:04:13.739> and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
took it to taking it out on the road and

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.070 
took it to taking it out on the road and
tried<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.430> out<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.580> just<00:04:14.700> got<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.900> would<00:04:15.989> be

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
tried it out I just got it that would be

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.759 
tried it out I just got it that would be
another<00:04:16.380> review<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.549> come<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.900> let's<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.530> put

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
another review to come so let's just put

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.380 
another review to come so let's just put
this<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.220> side<00:04:20.310> right<00:04:20.820> now<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:23.240> on<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
this to the side right now and on the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.840 
this to the side right now and on the
inside<00:04:26.150> has<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.360> standard<00:04:27.780> D<00:04:27.960> rings<00:04:28.669> with<00:04:29.669> the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
inside has the standard D rings with the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.210 
inside has the standard D rings with the
loop<00:04:30.090> and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.520 

you<00:04:36.220> know<00:04:36.639> look<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.810> looks<00:04:37.990> quite

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
you know look and it looks quite

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.350 
you know look and it looks quite
comfortable<00:04:39.160> very<00:04:39.700> thick<00:04:40.030> patty<00:04:40.360> now<00:04:42.360> it

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
comfortable very thick patty now it

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.480 
comfortable very thick patty now it
doesn't<00:04:43.660> look<00:04:43.780> very<00:04:43.810> big<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:45.010> way<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.280> looks

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
doesn't look very big the way it looks

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.330 
doesn't look very big the way it looks
now<00:04:45.720> well<00:04:46.720> once<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.020> put<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:47.350> on<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.889> actually

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
now well once you put it on it actually

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.220 
now well once you put it on it actually
becomes<00:04:48.639> very<00:04:48.910> big<00:04:49.180> I'm<00:04:49.510> gonna<00:04:49.960> demonstrate

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
becomes very big I'm gonna demonstrate

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:57.180 
becomes very big I'm gonna demonstrate
that<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:55.389> as<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.630> can<00:04:55.780> see<00:04:55.960> once<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.919> put<00:04:57.100> it

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
that and as you can see once you put it

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.980 
that and as you can see once you put it
on<00:04:57.310> it's<00:04:57.610> quite<00:04:57.760> large<00:05:03.210> okay<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.450> as<00:05:04.750> far<00:05:04.930> as

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
on it's quite large okay and as far as

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.219 
on it's quite large okay and as far as
these<00:05:05.200> visors<00:05:05.440> go<00:05:06.510> they<00:05:07.510> don't<00:05:07.630> quite<00:05:07.900> come

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
these visors go they don't quite come

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.860 
these visors go they don't quite come
down<00:05:08.470> far<00:05:08.800> enough<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.460> guess<00:05:10.210> right<00:05:10.840> now

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
down far enough I guess right now

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.719 
down far enough I guess right now
they're<00:05:11.350> they're<00:05:11.590> pretty<00:05:11.860> good<00:05:12.040> but<00:05:12.340> once<00:05:12.610> you

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
they're they're pretty good but once you

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.190 
they're they're pretty good but once you
get<00:05:12.880> moving<00:05:13.090> probably<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.900> wind's

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
get moving probably and the wind's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.960 
get moving probably and the wind's
hitting<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.530> in<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.650> face<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:15.850> gonna

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
hitting you in the face it's gonna

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.690 
hitting you in the face it's gonna
probably<00:05:16.330> pick<00:05:16.479> up<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.750> helmet<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.700> you're

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
probably pick up this helmet and you're

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.870 
probably pick up this helmet and you're
gonna<00:05:18.820> get<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.060> line<00:05:19.360> right<00:05:19.660> in<00:05:19.690> your<00:05:20.729> field<00:05:21.729> of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
gonna get a line right in your field of

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.940 
gonna get a line right in your field of
vision<00:05:22.060> when<00:05:22.600> you're<00:05:22.750> riding<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.620> that's<00:05:23.830> what

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
vision when you're riding so that's what

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.860 
vision when you're riding so that's what
I<00:05:23.979> suspect<00:05:24.190> is<00:05:24.580> gonna<00:05:24.820> happen<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.450> don't<00:05:25.750> know

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
I suspect is gonna happen I don't know

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.460 
I suspect is gonna happen I don't know
that<00:05:26.080> yet

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
that yet

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.770 
that yet
but<00:05:26.650> that's<00:05:26.830> what<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.040> think<00:05:27.450> only<00:05:28.450> because<00:05:28.750> I

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
but that's what I think only because I

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.659 
but that's what I think only because I
have<00:05:29.050> another<00:05:29.350> helmet<00:05:29.830> that<00:05:30.040> that's<00:05:30.430> what

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
have another helmet that that's what

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.330 
have another helmet that that's what
exactly<00:05:31.150> happens<00:05:31.600> that<00:05:32.440> once<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:32.979> on<00:05:33.130> like

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
exactly happens that once it's on like

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.129 
exactly happens that once it's on like
this<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.820> you're<00:05:33.910> not<00:05:34.030> moving<00:05:34.479> it's<00:05:34.630> fine<00:05:34.900> but

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
this and you're not moving it's fine but

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.409 
this and you're not moving it's fine but
once<00:05:35.350> you<00:05:35.470> start<00:05:35.740> getting<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.130> wind<00:05:36.419> you

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
once you start getting that wind you

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.330 
once you start getting that wind you
know<00:05:37.450> anything<00:05:37.840> over<00:05:38.110> 50<00:05:38.289> 60<00:05:38.830> miles<00:05:39.039> an<00:05:39.220> hour

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
know anything over 50 60 miles an hour

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.880 
know anything over 50 60 miles an hour
you<00:05:39.550> start<00:05:39.789> getting<00:05:40.030> that<00:05:40.120> wind<00:05:40.360> pressure<00:05:40.890> it

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
you start getting that wind pressure it

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.400 
you start getting that wind pressure it
picks<00:05:42.190> up<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.520> helmet<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.030> you<00:05:43.539> get<00:05:43.720> this<00:05:43.900> at

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
picks up the helmet and you get this at

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.950 
picks up the helmet and you get this at
the<00:05:44.530> bottom<00:05:44.890> of<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.220> of<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.210> of<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.660> glasses

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.450 

now

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.600 

it's<00:06:16.360> very<00:06:16.600> comfortable<00:06:17.050> I'm<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.610> twenty

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
it's very comfortable I'm a twenty

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.570 
it's very comfortable I'm a twenty
twenty<00:06:19.450> two<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.750> a<00:06:19.810> half<00:06:19.990> inches<00:06:20.440> my<00:06:21.040> head<00:06:21.280> and

twenty two and a half inches my head and

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.640 
twenty two and a half inches my head and
this<00:06:22.300> is<00:06:22.450> a<00:06:22.480> medium

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
this is a medium

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.130 
this is a medium
I<00:06:23.680> spoke<00:06:24.340> to<00:06:24.550> RevZilla<00:06:25.120> who<00:06:25.480> I<00:06:25.540> bought<00:06:25.870> it<00:06:26.020> off

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
I spoke to RevZilla who I bought it off

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.110 
I spoke to RevZilla who I bought it off
of<00:06:26.380> and<00:06:26.560> they<00:06:26.680> recommended<00:06:27.280> a<00:06:27.400> medium<00:06:27.790> for<00:06:28.000> me

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
of and they recommended a medium for me

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.650 
of and they recommended a medium for me
they<00:06:28.600> say<00:06:28.840> it<00:06:28.960> runs<00:06:29.140> large<00:06:29.730> so<00:06:30.730> if<00:06:31.150> you're<00:06:31.570> in

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
they say it runs large so if you're in

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.650 
they say it runs large so if you're in
between<00:06:31.810> sizes<00:06:32.310> they<00:06:33.310> said<00:06:33.580> to<00:06:33.790> take<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.030> size

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
between sizes they said to take the size

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.600 
between sizes they said to take the size
down<00:06:35.440> because<00:06:36.430> they<00:06:36.820> run<00:06:37.030> big<00:06:37.300> but<00:06:38.170> I<00:06:38.650> find<00:06:39.430> it

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
down because they run big but I find it

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.920 
down because they run big but I find it
to<00:06:39.730> run<00:06:39.970> exact<00:06:40.860> so<00:06:41.860> I'm<00:06:42.820> a<00:06:42.880> medium<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.630> that's

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
to run exact so I'm a medium and that's

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.050 
to run exact so I'm a medium and that's
exactly<00:06:44.440> what<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:44.920> is<00:06:44.950> a<00:06:45.100> medium<00:06:45.580> it<00:06:45.700> fits<00:06:45.910> me

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
exactly what it is a medium it fits me

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.300 
exactly what it is a medium it fits me
perfectly<00:06:46.510> I<00:06:46.810> think<00:06:47.620> if<00:06:47.680> I<00:06:47.740> would<00:06:47.920> have<00:06:47.950> took<00:06:48.190> a

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
perfectly I think if I would have took a

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.440 
perfectly I think if I would have took a
large<00:06:48.490> it<00:06:48.730> would<00:06:48.820> have<00:06:48.910> been<00:06:49.030> a<00:06:49.060> little<00:06:49.270> bit

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
large it would have been a little bit

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.770 
large it would have been a little bit
loose<00:06:49.600> on<00:06:49.870> me<00:06:51.150> as<00:06:52.150> far<00:06:52.420> as<00:06:52.450> the<00:06:54.600> you<00:06:55.600> know<00:06:55.720> I'm

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
loose on me as far as the you know I'm

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.410 
loose on me as far as the you know I'm
swinging<00:06:56.410> back<00:06:56.680> and<00:06:56.710> forth<00:06:56.950> I<00:07:00.150> think<00:07:01.150> it's

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420 
swinging back and forth I think it's

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.180 
swinging back and forth I think it's
very<00:07:01.540> good<00:07:01.690> you<00:07:02.350> know<00:07:02.410> you've<00:07:02.710> got<00:07:02.860> a<00:07:02.890> full

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
very good you know you've got a full

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.400 
very good you know you've got a full
face<00:07:03.430> helmet<00:07:03.880> and<00:07:04.090> then<00:07:04.690> when<00:07:04.840> you<00:07:04.930> want<00:07:05.110> it

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.020 

you've<00:07:08.410> got<00:07:08.530> a<00:07:08.560> 3/4<00:07:09.160> helmet<00:07:09.490> so<00:07:09.820> I<00:07:09.850> think

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
you've got a 3/4 helmet so I think

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.110 
you've got a 3/4 helmet so I think
that's<00:07:10.570> one<00:07:10.810> of<00:07:10.840> the<00:07:10.930> reasons<00:07:11.290> why<00:07:11.470> I

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
that's one of the reasons why I

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.970 
that's one of the reasons why I
purchased<00:07:13.120> this<00:07:13.210> helmet<00:07:13.530> for<00:07:14.530> that<00:07:14.740> for<00:07:14.950> that

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
purchased this helmet for that for that

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.850 
purchased this helmet for that for that
sole<00:07:15.370> reason<00:07:16.170> also<00:07:17.170> there's<00:07:17.380> a<00:07:17.470> sticker<00:07:17.740> I

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
sole reason also there's a sticker I

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.920 
sole reason also there's a sticker I
notice<00:07:18.220> here<00:07:18.430> have<00:07:18.790> five<00:07:19.090> out<00:07:19.270> of<00:07:19.300> five<00:07:19.540> stars

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
notice here have five out of five stars

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.120 
notice here have five out of five stars
for<00:07:20.170> a<00:07:20.200> crash<00:07:20.700> test<00:07:21.700> so<00:07:22.480> that's<00:07:22.990> a<00:07:23.260> plus<00:07:23.890> in<00:07:24.100> my

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130 
for a crash test so that's a plus in my

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.630 
for a crash test so that's a plus in my
book<00:07:24.250> and<00:07:24.760> the<00:07:25.360> hive<00:07:25.540> is<00:07:26.220> something<00:07:27.220> that<00:07:27.370> I

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:27.640 
book and the hive is something that I

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.690 
book and the hive is something that I
would<00:07:28.330> want<00:07:28.750> just<00:07:29.650> to<00:07:29.830> be<00:07:29.980> seen<00:07:30.190> on<00:07:30.250> the<00:07:30.520> road

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:30.700 
would want just to be seen on the road

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.410 
would want just to be seen on the road
so<00:07:31.690> that's<00:07:32.140> my<00:07:32.350> review<00:07:32.850> I'll<00:07:33.850> make<00:07:34.060> a<00:07:34.090> review

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
so that's my review I'll make a review

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.000 
so that's my review I'll make a review
once<00:07:34.690> it's<00:07:34.900> on<00:07:35.050> the<00:07:35.170> road<00:07:35.290> and<00:07:35.470> I<00:07:35.500> wear<00:07:35.800> it<00:07:35.920> a

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
once it's on the road and I wear it a

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.100 
once it's on the road and I wear it a
couple<00:07:36.040> of<00:07:36.310> times<00:07:36.520> and<00:07:36.820> see<00:07:37.480> how<00:07:37.600> it<00:07:37.780> is<00:07:37.900> but

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110 
couple of times and see how it is but

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.720 
couple of times and see how it is but
like<00:07:38.200> I<00:07:38.290> said<00:07:38.500> the<00:07:38.620> only<00:07:38.740> issue<00:07:38.980> I<00:07:39.160> had<00:07:39.520> was

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:39.730 
like I said the only issue I had was

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.590 
like I said the only issue I had was
when<00:07:39.940> I<00:07:39.970> first<00:07:40.300> received<00:07:40.450> it<00:07:41.580> this<00:07:42.580> visor<00:07:42.940> the

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600 
when I first received it this visor the

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.540 
when I first received it this visor the
clip<00:07:43.930> that<00:07:43.960> holds<00:07:44.290> this<00:07:44.560> visor<00:07:44.830> wasn't

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
clip that holds this visor wasn't

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.570 
clip that holds this visor wasn't
connected<00:07:46.030> so<00:07:46.510> I<00:07:46.750> had<00:07:46.930> to<00:07:47.050> actually<00:07:47.980> put<00:07:48.220> it<00:07:48.490> on

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580 
connected so I had to actually put it on

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.320 
connected so I had to actually put it on
myself

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
myself
