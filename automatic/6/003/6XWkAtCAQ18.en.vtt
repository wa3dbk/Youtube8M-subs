00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.690
 I warmly welcome everyone to 100 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.730
 first show and would like to attend this 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.350
 not only welcome, but me 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.430
 Also thanks for being so 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 over the christmas time and after 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.930
 Christmas but many donations 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.910
 have some clear with the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.710
 Note because of a possible 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.989
 pending litigation with family tv 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.790
 but also many who just say 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.260
 Keep up the good work is the only one 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.580
 broadcast over still to them the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.190
 the only one that still exists 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.170
 yes, no land that I look at 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.030
 and it comes again and again 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.830
 I have new ones to say earlier 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.150
 seen in wdr and am by chance 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.000
 hit it again 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.380
 great and thank you but there are also 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.390
 many new ones come to that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.010
 they discover that I need to say yes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.049
 yes to the early seen us 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.369
 the heinz you have paper I have here 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.570
 I want something like that right away 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.180
 what to tell about it is on the other hand 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.170
 sometimes my employer shows me 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.820
 how can a light come on, yes 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.220
 Wortmann now has the lamp on 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 but we do something else here 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.140
 Nice gift techen in there is so 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.579
 a small box that looks like 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.539
 a little too big 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.759
 calculator 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.670
 but that is a hard drive and indeed 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.520
 a particularly secure hard disk 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 internally has an encryption of one 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.869
 256 abs encryption in it 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.530
 and she has here a forward one 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.880
 numerical falls that one needs around the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.170
 to start up at all but that 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.359
 is not enough you have to do something different 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.109
 so have the plate is 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:04.359
 connected normally via usb 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.770
 do this here and if you look at the 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.329
 we would change computers 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.280
 not see at all 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.800
 These are the two drives again 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.330
 she has that and now I have here 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.850
 another two smart cards she has 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.770
 just when I'm doing the inserts 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.600
 that does not think anymore and if I do 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.770
 now wants to put the plate into operation 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:31.090
 I have to use the smartcard 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.060
 then up here couple that was the one 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.370
 broken that was the broken must already 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.100
 replace the right one then runs 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.470
 up a few leds up and then 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.390
 I have an 8 digit pin code 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.420
 that's what I'm doing now 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:53.260
 also can remember easily on 1 2 3 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.700
 4 5 6 7 8 set that is now for 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.980
 me so that I can remember this 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.140
 this pin code can be changed at any time 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.320
 become 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.470
 and that is the connection so 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.780
 smartcard pin code plus plate if one 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.010
 everything has three together and right 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 Now again on the monitor stone 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.070
 we see that we have one down here 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.130
 third hard disk has the has 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.720
 digittrade high security harddisk and 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.650
 that's the whole secret in that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.930
 it's built to shed a 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.580
 is that one can see on whom accesses 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.620
 are by the holograms at the side 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.960
 that they are hurt and you need them 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.210
 just all three security zones one 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.730
 needs the pin-code the smartcard and 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.860
 one can use the plate the pin code 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.720
 change at any time 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.150
 that makes sense if you for example 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.860
 the way there is also the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.780
 standard with three cards 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.770
 delivered because so if everyone 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.510
 smartcard still belongs to an extra 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.410
 pin code details other in bonns 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 it was always accident 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 you can do the pin code 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.790
 change the keyboard here with the keyboard and 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.710
 then just knows the only one of the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.730
 card has 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.200
 if somebody else now their power 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.150
 had tried a few times around that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.310
 i have done i have to give and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.040
 because then it has a direct first 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.750
 invalidated smartcard that is me 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.320
 have tried it so that is the code 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.790
 the one on this is destroyed and the one 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.260
 card is simply no longer usable 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.170
 she can just throw it away 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.690
 the friends of digittrade become me 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.640
 now rant that I break you 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.890
 but that should be just that 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.350
 value in addition, the plate also has 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.990
 a separate pin code a hardware 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.820
 pin code because you can this key 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.450
 The default is once from the factory 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.590
 covers change for a fresh new 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.990
 safety short though, if 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.370
 you change the key 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.410
 information that is on the plate 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.390
 then you have to get lost again 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.500
 reinstall and can reformat 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.670
 continue to use 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.440
 that's what the digittrade is doing here 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.560
 have applied it meanwhile for the 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.170
 bsi is registered and will be coming soon 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.020
 certified it is meant for companies 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.660
 who want very secure data or 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.190
 for authorities secret services all the 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.830
 want to have data that even if the 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.290
 Nobody ever gets lost 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.390
 You can start with that, too 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.480
 For example, you know the right code 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.280
 but just caught one time 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.990
 then type in combination then becomes 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.730
 directly destroys the content of the plate 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.580
 and even the smartcard is destroyed 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.300
 you should not be able to do anything anymore 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.770
 encrypted records are nothing 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.120
 new I have been for a few years always 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.220
 I'm always here with them 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.500
 they have already when you are 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.970
 looking closer is very much for art 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.290
 but she has done me a good service 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.670
 also has an encryption on it 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.610
 Of course, it is not as safe as here 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.110
 from the digittrade or here's one 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.260
 You can have that stick here now 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.450
 the datatraveler of kingston of it 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.260
 not very sure but it's enough 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:13.440
 to have normal data they all have 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.080
 a disadvantage you need a piece 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.140
 software on the computer and that the 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.900
 software that debunk the dm that 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.610
 decode again represents that is 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.170
 yes at the digittrade you can not do it 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.090
 at any operating systems on expenses 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.300
 and if you have the combination running 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.620
 it just so and now enough of that 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.970
 complicated now is the wolf one 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.160
 I believe a fly in the 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:40.050
 quad core quadcopter over quadrocopter 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.730
 what are we called his 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.650
 send a thank you for watching 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.110
 say goodbye until next time and 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.840
 but whatever left over at the end of a quote 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.840
 shows a bit and shot from chistow 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.740
 sio 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.740
 Yes
