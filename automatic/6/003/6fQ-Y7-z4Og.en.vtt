of diversifying you know different ways

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
of diversifying you know different ways
of<00:01:21.270> making<00:01:21.390> money<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.110> had<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> seminar

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
of making money I just had a seminar

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
of making money I just had a seminar
millionaire<00:01:23.520> mind<00:01:23.729> intensive<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.479> said

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
millionaire mind intensive and they said

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
millionaire mind intensive and they said
you<00:01:25.229> imagine<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.979> money<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you imagine that all of your money was

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.260 
you imagine that all of your money was
on<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.180> table<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.979> table<00:01:29.189> had<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.759> leg

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
on a table and that table had one leg

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.569 
on a table and that table had one leg
how<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.930> table<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.340> well

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
how would that table do not very well

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
how would that table do not very well
with<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:33.810> basically<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
with it and so that's basically what it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.660 
with it and so that's basically what it
is<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> people<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.400> all

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
is for a lot of people they have all

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.679 
is for a lot of people they have all
their<00:01:36.030> money<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.630> their<00:01:37.729> assets<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.570> know

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.440 
their money all their assets you know
one<00:01:40.560> thing<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> job<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.270> there
