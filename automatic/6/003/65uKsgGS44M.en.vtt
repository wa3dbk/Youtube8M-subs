near<00:00:13.700> the<00:00:13.880> precision<00:00:14.389> of<00:00:14.480> that<00:00:14.599> when<00:00:14.719> that<00:00:14.780> one

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
near the precision of that when that one

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.510 
near the precision of that when that one
absolutely<00:00:15.410> went<00:00:15.650> back<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.040> forth

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
absolutely went back and forth

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.249 
absolutely went back and forth
I<00:00:16.550> couldn't<00:00:17.119> even<00:00:17.180> compete<00:00:17.599> with<00:00:17.779> that<00:00:17.810> that

was<00:00:18.439> impressive<00:00:19.070> crystal<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:19.910> joel<00:00:20.150> saw<00:00:20.390> how

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
was impressive crystal the joel saw how

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.330 
was impressive crystal the joel saw how
easy<00:00:20.960> was<00:00:21.259> it<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.439> use<00:00:21.710> I<00:00:21.740> mean<00:00:21.949> you've<00:00:22.100> cut<00:00:22.310> a

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
easy was it to use I mean you've cut a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.370 
easy was it to use I mean you've cut a
precise<00:00:22.970> square<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.630> there<00:00:23.750> you're<00:00:23.900> into<00:00:24.289> the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
precise square and there you're into the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.900 
precise square and there you're into the
safe<00:00:24.590> look<00:00:24.949> I<00:00:25.160> haven't<00:00:25.310> ever<00:00:25.430> used<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.730> power

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
safe look I haven't ever used the power

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.029 
safe look I haven't ever used the power
so<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:26.240> my<00:00:26.330> entire<00:00:26.630> life<00:00:26.960> that<00:00:27.199> was<00:00:27.470> amazing

that was incredible

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.060 
that was incredible
crystal<00:00:29.660> was<00:00:29.779> able<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.080> go<00:00:30.260> back<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.619> forth

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
crystal was able to go back and forth

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.130 
crystal was able to go back and forth
with<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.460> dualsaw<00:00:31.970> like<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.540> hot<00:00:32.870> knife

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
with the dualsaw like a hot knife

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.200 
with the dualsaw like a hot knife
through<00:00:33.170> butter<00:00:33.440> on<00:00:33.980> something<00:00:34.610> as<00:00:34.730> tough<00:00:35.000> as

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
through butter on something as tough as

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.290 
through butter on something as tough as
a<00:00:35.239> safe<00:00:35.570> that's<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.500> power<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.160> precision<00:00:38.000> of

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
a safe that's the power and precision of

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.720 
a safe that's the power and precision of

was a nightmare but the dualsaw it's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.970 
was a nightmare but the dualsaw it's
gonna<00:00:53.539> make<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.020> breeze<00:00:54.379> watch<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:56.980> what

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
I'm working on right now is a simple pet

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.319 
I'm working on right now is a simple pet
dog<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:00.739> try<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.070> without<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.579> jewel<00:01:01.879> saw<00:01:02.059> and

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
dog but try this without a jewel saw and

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.849 
dog but try this without a jewel saw and
it's<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.600> lot<00:01:02.870> harder<00:01:03.140> than<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:03.440> looks

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
it's a lot harder than it looks

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.100 
it's a lot harder than it looks
first<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.820> have<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:04.970> make<00:01:05.119> pilot<00:01:05.660> holes<00:01:05.840> and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
first you have to make pilot holes and

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.260 
first you have to make pilot holes and
drill<00:01:06.140> them<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:06.950> then<00:01:07.310> use<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.520> source<00:01:07.910> or<00:01:08.090> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
drill them and then use a source or a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.230 
drill them and then use a source or a
jigsaw<00:01:08.810> an<00:01:09.709> aluminium<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.459> vibration<00:01:11.119> is

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
jigsaw an aluminium the vibration is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.449 
jigsaw an aluminium the vibration is
terrible<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.990> even<00:01:12.259> dangerous<00:01:12.770> because<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
terrible and even dangerous because the

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.040 
terrible and even dangerous because the
tip<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.849> the<00:01:13.910> blade<00:01:14.030> keeps<00:01:14.539> hitting<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.959> other

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
tip of the blade keeps hitting the other

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.350 
tip of the blade keeps hitting the other
side<00:01:15.349> of<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.590> door<00:01:15.770> but<00:01:16.490> look<00:01:16.700> how<00:01:16.910> with<00:01:17.119> no

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
side of the door but look how with no

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.199 
side of the door but look how with no
pilot<00:01:17.630> holes<00:01:18.020> no<00:01:18.619> drilling<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.250> using<00:01:19.910> easy

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
pilot holes no drilling and using easy

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.449

plunge<00:01:20.599> cuts<00:01:20.929> in<00:01:21.140> both<00:01:21.410> directions<00:01:21.890> the

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
plunge cuts in both directions the

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.980 
plunge cuts in both directions the
dualsaw<00:01:23.000> gets<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.450> job<00:01:23.690> done<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:24.229> no<00:01:24.289> time

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
dualsaw gets the job done in no time

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.219 
dualsaw gets the job done in no time
that<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.470> perfect<00:01:28.069> cut<00:01:28.420> for<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> perfect<00:01:29.929> fit

of course the circular saw so heavy and
so<00:02:45.920> powerful<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.760> generates<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.569> much<00:02:47.630> heat

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
so powerful it generates so much heat

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.870 
so powerful it generates so much heat
