00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 tweet to respond to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 notifications when a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 message in the purest style there are 28 is a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.760
 tweet that I loved and the truth 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.439
 it works for all those people who do not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 he wants to lose his jailbreak to climb 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.060
 goodbye 8 so well let's go with the video 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 well the click is called bait sms is that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 icon that can mark that does not change it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.140
 by the icon there are tables but they have the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.340
 same function 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 that is, they will reach us there, we are going to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.669
 people from tables along with the messages 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.230
 normal cell phone and one how can 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 see here as it brings me a message and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 lower gene to be able to call it open 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 answer from it as you can see 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.340
 if I'm still from the bottom up as 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 can see can I answer it pulls me out and of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.570
 there I simply put what I'm going to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 I will also write 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.480
 I'm selling as long as the message I can 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.309
 make a I'm from left right to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 take out the screen and go to the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.149
 notification along with the small bump 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.559
 that is put on the icon is also going 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
 but if I instead of doing the psoe 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.730
 how can you see the truth later to the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.770
 later option as you can see it goes 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.730
 the message but the bach is not going and in the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.019
 status bar puts me what is a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.820
 little incognito that if we take 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.480
 dependent and if the twine for and as 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.740
 can see 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.570
 but it is what is the message in the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.370
 screen for it can respond from 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.960
 right there and also as you can see 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.400
 a user from top to bottom like 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.110
 can see let's do what is the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.640
 full combination that I have had 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.350
 with that person that is a very option 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.060
 useful that I have loved and I 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 use daily but if you want to see all 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 the combination already complete on screen 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.190
 big as you can see they give you to open already 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.990
 they could see the whole complete combination 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.640
 full details to go from 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.770
 better grade and another very good function 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.450
 since tweet is how you can see I can 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.560
 download my notification center and in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.060
 the bottom right as they can 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.680
 see if I give cover and I can send a 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.870
 message to any of my contacts 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
 For example, I'll put Caesar and from there 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.200
 I can see any message how can 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 measure I sent it and it looks perfectly and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 a sprint team will be no we're not going like this 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.620
 -said- we look for the byte tweet sms such 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.150
 and as it is sent, version 8.2 and 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.970
 it's in the repo the big box and it's 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.130
 compatible with ios 5 v6 and help 7 and is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 free you can say but after 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.730
 seven days a license of 7 is charged 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.230
 dollars that you have to pay for the paypal 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.090
 as you can see here we are not going to go to 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.710
 messages and in the upper right 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.020
 as you can see we enter there in the part 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.850
 of adjustments and we do not give work and they do not know 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.649
 buy license and there we could 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.680
 buy if we wanted for $ 7.99 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.930
 It is super expensive but I think there is rest 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.730
 and you can not find it free and good 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.590
 guys until today's video I hope 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.829
 they can give a like comment 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.180
 walker that we are in this video too 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.879
