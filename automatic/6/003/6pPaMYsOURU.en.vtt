area my hammer Raptor 660 engine I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.059 
area my hammer Raptor 660 engine I
bought<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.080> quite<00:00:07.259> broken<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.740> was<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
bought is quite broken I was going to

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.070 
bought is quite broken I was going to
fix<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:13.380> piston<00:00:13.950> bearing<00:00:15.080> had

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
fix it up and the piston bearing had

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.650 
fix it up and the piston bearing had
gotten<00:00:16.289> stuck<00:00:19.699> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.820> see<00:00:21.000> how<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.240> ripped

itself<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.560> damaged<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> piston<00:00:28.730> inside<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
itself and damaged the piston inside the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:44.380 
itself and damaged the piston inside the
cylinder<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:32.600> think<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.930> hone<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.350> away

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.540 

if<00:00:44.990> not<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.290> have<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.680> change<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.070> sleeve<00:00:48.550> and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
if not I have to change the sleeve and

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.420 
if not I have to change the sleeve and
here<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.210> notorious<00:00:51.040> one-way<00:00:52.040> bearing

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
here is that notorious one-way bearing

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:06.750 
here is that notorious one-way bearing
in<00:00:52.790> rapsa<00:01:02.890> there<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:03.980> can<00:01:04.130> see<00:01:04.370> there's<00:01:04.640> our

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
in rapsa there you can see there's our

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.990 
in rapsa there you can see there's our
this<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:08.030> normal<00:01:08.479> play<00:01:10.120> at<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.300> crankshaft

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.910 

then<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:17.030> got<00:01:17.240> this<00:01:17.390> Pike<00:01:17.660> it<00:01:17.869> was<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.590> really

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
then I got this Pike it was in really

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.880 
then I got this Pike it was in really
bad<00:01:19.390> condition<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:20.900> I<00:01:20.960> just<00:01:21.259> tore<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.590> all

bad condition so I just tore it all

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.550 
bad condition so I just tore it all
apart<00:01:24.940> down<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.420> frame<00:01:27.759> its<00:01:28.759> I'm<00:01:28.940> gonna

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
apart down to the frame its I'm gonna

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.999 
apart down to the frame its I'm gonna
sand<00:01:30.560> down<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:30.979> paint<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:35.530> have<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.770> change

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
sand down and paint I have to change

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.639 
sand down and paint I have to change
most<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> bearings<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:39.110> one<00:01:39.500> is

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
most of the bearings in it this one is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.340 
most of the bearings in it this one is
quite<00:01:39.830> fun<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:44.360> lower<00:01:44.540> steering<00:01:45.080> stem

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
quite fun the lower steering stem

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.660 
quite fun the lower steering stem
bearing<00:01:49.090> have<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> bolt<00:01:51.400> upside<00:01:52.400> down

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
bearing have to get a bolt upside down

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.140 
bearing have to get a bolt upside down
to<00:01:53.299> loosen<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.810> one<00:01:54.400> I'll<00:01:55.400> make<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.610> video<00:01:55.820> and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
to loosen that one I'll make a video and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.560 
to loosen that one I'll make a video and
show<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.659> how<00:01:56.810> that's<00:01:56.990> done<00:01:57.140> soon<00:02:01.299> this<00:02:02.299> crowd

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
show you how that's done soon this crowd

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.820 
show you how that's done soon this crowd
has<00:02:02.750> been<00:02:02.780> rear-ended<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:07.159> la<00:02:08.590> accessed<00:02:09.590> was

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
has been rear-ended so la accessed was

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
has been rear-ended so la accessed was
broken<00:02:10.540> really<00:02:11.540> bent<00:02:11.860> badly

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.970 

and<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> taillight<00:02:16.870> was<00:02:17.020> broken<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:20.980> found

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.330 

another<00:02:25.519> axis<00:02:25.909> from<00:02:26.450> another<00:02:26.719> Yamaha<00:02:27.170> bike<00:02:30.340> up

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
another axis from another Yamaha bike up

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.039 
another axis from another Yamaha bike up
450<00:02:32.030> bike<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:38.030> most<00:02:38.269> holes<00:02:38.510> are<00:02:38.719> the<00:02:38.840> same

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
450 bike and the most holes are the same

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.990 
450 bike and the most holes are the same
but<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.099> would<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:41.769> cut<00:02:42.769> off<00:02:42.980> end<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.760> both

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
but I would have to cut off end of both

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.020 
but I would have to cut off end of both
of<00:02:44.180> them<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:46.569> well<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:47.780> one<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:48.859> one<00:02:49.030> it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
of them and well this one to this one it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:03:02.159 
of them and well this one to this one it
is<00:02:50.269> old<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:55.959> also<00:02:56.959> got<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.579> rear<00:02:58.579> brake<00:02:58.760> light

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:07.960 

from<00:03:03.169> that<00:03:03.439> 450<00:03:04.250> Yamaha<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.769> same<00:03:07.010> bolt

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
from that 450 Yamaha it's the same bolt

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.970 
from that 450 Yamaha it's the same bolt
pattern<00:03:08.419> so<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:08.989> use<00:03:09.109> that<00:03:09.379> it's<00:03:09.620> really

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
pattern so I can use that it's really

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.890 
pattern so I can use that it's really
good<00:03:11.109> so<00:03:12.109> let's<00:03:12.349> go<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.650> fun<00:03:13.450> find<00:03:14.450> things<00:03:14.720> that

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
good so let's go to fun find things that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.530 
good so let's go to fun find things that
fit<00:03:16.750> between<00:03:17.750> bikes<00:03:22.060> always<00:03:23.060> good<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.359> check

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
fit between bikes always good to check

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.190 
fit between bikes always good to check
what<00:03:23.780> fits<00:03:26.109> yeah

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.580
