00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.519
 to show off a little bit but after all I 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.840
 the right 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.370

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.090
 sugar water you cook a small 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.290
 little and when that colors it's awesome good 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.800
 now how does his greed 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.820

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:33.640
 cooking their talent and mixing 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:36.820
 well a little drops of vinegar 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 it's just for texture 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.460
 avoid that the crystallized sugar 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.270
 Here here it is beautiful I'm going 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.410
 let cool 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.780
 I pose there we will return talent for the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.120
 shooting at I need sugar an egg 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.730
 so for this recipe it is that the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.800
 sugar yellow and here we stay 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 connected by being the laptops if you 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.829
 leave the legs in the sugar 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.379
 a few minutes and cooked and you have 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.860
 an omelet therefore especially once 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:13.960
 of energy that following I added the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.790
 mascarpone the mascarpone is a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.020
 Italian cheese is made today 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.840
 find it everywhere they go back from 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.670
 more and more in the kitchen 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 the interest is the consistency we have 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.080
 something silky soft and then 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.369
 what a delight 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 good I have more than a good coffee 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.250
 if you have an espresso it's nickel 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.899
 but otherwise to coffee machine wine that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.929
 can do it too so I 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.420
 pour it is the amaretto tip top 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.250
 a good drink some cookies 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.439
 spoons that people live a little frozen 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.280
 breaks like that then that's just 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:02.090
 a few seconds 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:10.759
 it's going very, very fast, we're taking a maryse 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:12.530
 that one mixes is more delicately to 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.980
 barely two spoons why are you 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.910
 too sweet with caramel is a 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.549
 true treat 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:33.049
 m good now done in the side are 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:42.590
 1100 m everywhere are fun to cut 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:44.420
 sticks and after we sting to go 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.060
 straighten in the end once 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.389
 the audience started to take that holds 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.540
 all alone and alfie to put in 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.540
 freezer
