00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.519
 for this makeup / line we carry the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.230
 horns that come out through the 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.000
 hair so I'm going to use some horns 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.409
 I already have facts I leave the link 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 how to make them in the box 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 information I'm going to hold them with a 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.630
 hair band and I will surround them with 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.549
 my own hair to make the effect 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
 that she has in her hair 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 applied some contact lenses and directly I'm going 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 to start putting the prosthesis of the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.250
 ears that are pointed ears of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.689
 harpo are super easy to apply 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 we just have to fill in a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.720
 little bit of cotton to create volume 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.979
 measure and paste them with more cake or with 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.979
 my spirit 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.460
 all right 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.189
 do not worry if the prosthesis is not 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.810
 the same color as our skin because 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.679
 then we will apply a base that is going to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.679
 unify everything 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.250
 I'm going to take a makeup base and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.650
 I'm going to give a lighter touch with a face 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.330
 blank and I'm going to dilute everything with a 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.400
 cryo land megaplan to make it more 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.049
 easy to apply we apply it for everything 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.119
 the face and the neck with a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.649
 sponge and on the ears and prosthesis 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.040
 I'm going to apply it with a brush 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.040
 small 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.670
 it is understood 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.560
 let's start creating the effect of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.209
 volume I will use two cream colors 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.489
 the black and the brown I will not go 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.099
 mixing to create the intensity let's 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.260
 to intensity below the cheekbones and 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.880
 in the temple and then it's little by little 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.800
 we are going to give intensity the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.870
 holes of the prosthesis of the ear 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.870
 that we will be blurring with the sponge 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.650
 for the eye area we will use the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.719
 brown to give this depth in the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 inner area of ​​the lacrimal and around 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.720
 the outer part of the eyes and also to 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.260
 along the nose 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.210
 one of the important parts of finding 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.210
 tournament is around the jaw for 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.460
 create the most detailed and fine-tuned and by 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.620
 under the manzanitas to create the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.610
 effect that has between the inah of about 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.610
 very marked cheekbones 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.860
 have 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.690
 and a couple of details also shadows 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.980
 in the neck before moving on to make us 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.980
 the eyebrows in a normal way 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.849
 and 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.220
 to give the intensity the top line 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.140
 of tabs I'm going to use an eyeliner in 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.330
 gel and I'm going to delineate the top line 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.650
 only until the end of the eye wearing a 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.840
 little bit to the bottom line of 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.800
 eyelashes and blur it so that it stays 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800
 more natural integral 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.959
 no no no 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.480
 for the lips we are going to create an effect 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.099
 of very intense red lips apply to 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.470
 other lipsticks first one that is going to be 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.510
 function will do basic function and 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.940
 another much more intense over and then 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.099
 delineate all the lips with a with 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.720
 black and I'm going to blur it a little bit 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.800
 to give the effect that jelly has 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.870
 nanas lips 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.640
