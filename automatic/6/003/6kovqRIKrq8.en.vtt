00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.040
 When people come to Thailand ... 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.960
 they want to see an elephant. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.240
 They want to ride it and feed it. 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.380
 They do not realize how much violence and coercion it requires ... 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.120
 before the elephant allows you to climb on his back for a ride. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 Many elephants kill their young immediately after birth. 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.020
 They know what life awaits that young. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.420
 They want to save him that. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.220
 That's why they kill him immediately after birth. 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 We must put an end to the chain of violence. 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.220
 Who can take care of this? The tourist in Thailand. 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.460
 He has that power. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.880
 I'm Katherine Connor from BLES, Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary. 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.620
 Here in Sukhothai in Thailand we take care of the welfare of the elephant. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
 We don't want to make a profit or entertain the tourists. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.800
 We want to make a difference in the lives of these abused elephants. 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.080
 A calm and slow pace of life prevails here. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.300
 We adapt to the elephant. 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.180
 If he wants to move on, we will follow him. 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.580
 If he wants to graze, we wait. 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.660
 For many people who come here ... 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.460
 This is a completely different world, a different way of living. 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.700
 People change because of their visit here. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260
 Here are Pang Noi and Pang Suai. 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.440
 And behind you are Wassana, Lotus and Pang Dow. 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 They are known as the gossip girls. 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.820
 You can hear them constantly trumpeting, roaring, beeping and satisfied growls. 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.200
 The cameras are usually focused on them. 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.000
 They want to know when it's their turn. 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.120
 I have always had a passion for animals. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.880
 When I arrived in Thailand, I wanted to see an elephant. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.440
 I started as a volunteer in an elephant center in northern Thailand. 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.520
 There I met the elephant boy Boon Lott, Survivor in Thai. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.580
 That young boy touched my heart and changed my life forever. 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.840
 I would not have started BLES without his death. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.600
 I had given him all the attention and all my money. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.340
 In Thailand people always looked at the elephant with great respect. 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.480
 He worked in the logging. A Thai law put an end to this in 1989. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.520
 Thousands of elephants and their owners were out of work. 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.620
 What did those people want? They did not dispose of their elephant. 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.380
 Their family had to eat. That was the start of elephant tourism. 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.920
 Elephants are forced to do tricks. 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.900
 The training required for this is horrible. 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.420
 The elephant must be tamed. 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.460
 The elephant cub is being stung and beaten ... 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.000
 until his mind is broken. 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.620
 Then he has become a machine in the tourist industry. 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.320
 This is Boon Tong. In Pattaya she made hiking trips with tourists. 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.360
 She had to carry a large, heavy chair on her back. 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.240
 After years of carrying that burden ... 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.400
 she has a broken back. 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.980
 This is Wassana. 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.100
 She stepped on a land mine during illegal logging on the Thai border. 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.560
 Despite her deformed front leg ... 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.440
 she was sold to the tourist industry to make trips. 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.000
 I do not believe that man is cruel by nature. 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.600
 The atrocities committed against the elephant in Thailand ... 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.140
 due to a lack of knowledge. 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.760
 The elephant owner does not realize how heavy it is for the back and joints. 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
 If he does, I would hope he will stop. 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.960
 In the three guest houses, two people can spend the night per house. 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.100
 You have to pay for it. We have no program here. 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.560
 We do not encourage guests to approach an elephant on its property. 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.040
 We want to save the abused elephant ... 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.360
 and have him repaired here. 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.220
 He must again independently on a protected piece of land ... 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.340
 able to survive as if he lives in the wild. 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.880
 What I find very special about them and what surprises me the most ... 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.080
 is their ability to forgive. 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.820
 These elephants have all been abused by us, by humans. 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.880
 Yet they are at ease here. They accept us. 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.060
 They allow us into their living space. We can walk with them. 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.980
 I think that's incredible.
