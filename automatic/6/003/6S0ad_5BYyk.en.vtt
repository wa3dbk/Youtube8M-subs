00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
contained that's the reason I have both
the<00:01:58.770> washers<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.310> top<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> gives<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> bushings

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the washers on top it gives the bushings

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.320 
the washers on top it gives the bushings
a<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.890> kind<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.010> a<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.220> true<00:02:02.760> feel<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
a very kind of a very true feel as to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.390 
a very kind of a very true feel as to
what<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> bushings<00:02:03.840> should<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:05.189> back

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
what the bushings should do in my back

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.120 
what the bushings should do in my back
truck<00:02:05.790> I've<00:02:05.970> got<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.479> yellow<00:02:06.780> barrel<00:02:07.770> once

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
truck I've got a yellow barrel once

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.740 
truck I've got a yellow barrel once
again<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> don't<00:02:08.850> have<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> washer<00:02:09.540> on<00:02:09.600> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
again but I don't have a washer on it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330 
again but I don't have a washer on it
this<00:02:09.840> time<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.290> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.590> helps<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.010> bushing

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
this time this kind of helps the bushing

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.580 
this time this kind of helps the bushing
kind<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:11.640> squish<00:02:12.390> out<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.900> allows<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.440> back

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
kind of squish out and allows the back

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
kind of squish out and allows the back
truck<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.070> kind<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> turn<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.760> grip<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.030> little

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
truck to kind of turn and grip a little

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.330 
truck to kind of turn and grip a little
bit<00:02:15.330> more<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.750> makes<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.920> little<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.190> more

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
bit more it makes it a little bit more

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460 
bit more it makes it a little bit more
sloppy<00:02:17.730> which<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.450> kind<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.019> good<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:19.380> of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
sloppy which is kind of a good way of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.199 
sloppy which is kind of a good way of
saying<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.980> adds<00:02:20.160> traction<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> back

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
saying that it adds traction to the back

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.170 
saying that it adds traction to the back
truck<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> back<00:02:23.190> bushing<00:02:23.700> road
