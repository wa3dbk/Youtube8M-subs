do<00:00:27.210> release<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> full<00:00:27.840> figure<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.289> they<00:00:28.439> do

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
do release a full figure if they do

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.890 
do release a full figure if they do
release<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> full<00:00:29.220> figure<00:00:29.550> i<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:30.720> he'd<00:00:30.810> be

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
release a full figure i think he'd be

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
release a full figure i think he'd be
cool<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.650> did<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.279> i<00:00:32.700> would<00:00:32.940> ba<00:00:33.090> jazz

in<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> heartbeat<00:00:35.750> there's<00:00:36.750> jezus<00:00:37.170> stance<00:00:37.440> on

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
in a heartbeat there's jezus stance on

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
in a heartbeat there's jezus stance on
the<00:00:37.680> back<00:00:40.100> strength<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.489> weak<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the back strength is kind of weak but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.029 
the back strength is kind of weak but
you<00:00:42.540> know<00:00:43.489> he's<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.640> really<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:44.910> strength

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
you know he's not really about strength

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.819 
you know he's not really about strength
some<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.160> about<00:00:47.309> skill<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> i'll<00:00:52.710> be

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
some more about skill so i'll be

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
some more about skill so i'll be
reviewing<00:00:52.980> i'll<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.850> reviewing<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.239> guy<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
reviewing i'll be reviewing this guy but

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
reviewing i'll be reviewing this guy but
it'd<00:00:54.629> probably<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> short<00:00:55.289> review<00:00:55.410> because

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it'd probably be a short review because

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
it'd probably be a short review because
he's<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.449> i'm<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> big

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
he's not really you know i'm a big

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.529 
he's not really you know i'm a big

figure so see you guys in the rest of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.899 
figure so see you guys in the rest of
the<00:01:03.600> review<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:05.100> i<00:01:05.129> probably<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> say

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the review but i probably have to say

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.190 
the review but i probably have to say
that<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.900> packaging<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.640> probably<00:01:08.640> 8<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
that this packaging is probably 8 and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.570 
that this packaging is probably 8 and
the<00:01:10.200> part<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.650> nine<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.070> mean<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.490> not

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the part about a nine I mean it's not

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
the part about a nine I mean it's not
too<00:01:11.700> bad<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:13.200> looks<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> universe

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
too bad it looks just like the universe

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
too bad it looks just like the universe
just<00:01:14.189> momentum<00:01:14.780> miniaturized<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.229> that's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
just momentum miniaturized so that's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
just momentum miniaturized so that's
pretty<00:01:16.860> cool<00:01:17.360> anyway<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.630> four<00:01:18.930> of

size<00:01:56.850> comparison<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> tank

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
size comparison as you can see the tank

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.060 
size comparison as you can see the tank
is<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:59.009> huge<00:01:59.189> compared<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.680> my

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
is really huge compared in which in my

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.050 
is really huge compared in which in my
opinion<00:02:02.219> that's<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.820> perfect<00:02:03.000> scale<00:02:04.219> as<00:02:05.219> for

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
opinion that's the perfect scale as for

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
opinion that's the perfect scale as for
jazz<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.049> transform<00:02:07.409> him<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
jazz here going to transform him on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.059 
jazz here going to transform him on
camera<00:02:08.129> because<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.580> really<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.060> are

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
camera because it's not really that are

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.010 
camera because it's not really that are
the<00:02:11.069> first<00:02:11.340> thing<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.790> pop<00:02:12.660> off<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the first thing you do is pop off the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.640 
the first thing you do is pop off the
doors

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
doors

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.240 
doors
it's<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.159> hard<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.650> next<00:02:16.890> thing<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.069> do<00:02:17.159> is

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's not hard the next thing you do is
