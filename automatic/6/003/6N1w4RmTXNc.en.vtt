flying on the outside nice simple house
which<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.560> lot<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> wanted

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
which I think a lot of you if you wanted

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.490 
which I think a lot of you if you wanted
to<00:02:12.000> replicate<00:02:12.510> something<00:02:12.810> similar

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to replicate something similar

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.330 
to replicate something similar
could<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> nice<00:02:15.750> take<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.410> modern

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
could and it's a nice take on modern

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.980 
could and it's a nice take on modern
building<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.330> lot<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> people

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
building because then a lot of people

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.750 
building because then a lot of people
don't<00:02:19.650> realize<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:19.950> modern<00:02:20.400> building<00:02:20.670> is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
don't realize that modern building is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
don't realize that modern building is
just<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:21.120> mixing<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.960> lot<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.170> squares

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
just about mixing a lot of squares

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.830 
just about mixing a lot of squares
together<00:02:22.740> making<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:23.550> nice<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.330> stuff

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
together making it look nice and stuff

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.950 
together making it look nice and stuff
like<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.390> pay<00:02:27.390> attention<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
like that so pay attention to the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.450 
like that so pay attention to the
orientation<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> way<00:02:28.950> things<00:02:29.010> are<00:02:29.310> put

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
orientation or the way things are put

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.040 
orientation or the way things are put

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
if you see anything in his house and you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.800 
if you see anything in his house and you
think<00:04:38.700> like<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.210> could<00:04:39.390> they<00:04:39.510> could<00:04:39.570> have

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
think like you could they could have

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.930 
think like you could they could have
used<00:04:39.960> something<00:04:40.170> else<00:04:40.500> so<00:04:41.190> for<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.700> look

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
used something else so for it to look

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.690 
used something else so for it to look
better<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.690> house<00:04:42.930> was<00:04:43.140> built<00:04:43.170> like

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
better this house was built like

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.820 
better this house was built like
probably<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.970> few<00:04:45.330> Minecraft<00:04:45.870> versions<00:04:46.290> ago<00:04:46.560> so

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
probably a few Minecraft versions ago so

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.140 
probably a few Minecraft versions ago so
they<00:04:46.980> probably<00:04:47.160> would<00:04:47.460> have<00:04:47.490> done<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.910> if<00:04:48.000> they

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
they probably would have done it if they

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.820 
they probably would have done it if they
had<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.480> they<00:04:48.660> probably<00:04:49.080> didn't<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.710> when

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
had it they probably didn't have it when

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.990 
had it they probably didn't have it when
they<00:04:49.950> built<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.250> house<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:50.640> that's<00:04:50.820> probably

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
they built the house so that's probably

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.940 
they built the house so that's probably
why<00:04:51.240> they<00:04:51.390> didn't<00:04:51.600> do<00:04:51.750> certain<00:04:52.080> things<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.470> I

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
why they didn't do certain things like I

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.940 
why they didn't do certain things like I
don't<00:04:53.310> know<00:04:54.050> use<00:04:55.050> hoppers<00:04:55.470> or<00:04:55.680> stuff<00:04:55.860> like

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
don't know use hoppers or stuff like

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.590 
don't know use hoppers or stuff like
that<00:04:56.250> because<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:57.060> notice<00:04:57.270> there's<00:04:57.510> no

I'll<00:05:02.310> tell<00:05:02.550> about<00:05:02.580> what<00:05:02.760> I<00:05:02.820> said<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.180> listen

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.850 
I'll tell about what I said that listen
to<00:05:03.480> me<00:05:03.630> but<00:05:03.900> there<00:05:04.050> are<00:05:04.200> certain<00:05:04.560> things<00:05:04.590> that

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
to me but there are certain things that

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.830 
to me but there are certain things that
they<00:05:05.010> could<00:05:05.220> have<00:05:05.340> done<00:05:05.550> different<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:06.600> they

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
they could have done different but they

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.090 
they could have done different but they
probably<00:05:07.050> didn't<00:05:07.350> have<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.620> available<00:05:07.800> to

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
probably didn't have it available to

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.680 
probably didn't have it available to
them<00:05:08.190> when<00:05:08.490> they<00:05:08.580> actually<00:05:08.700> built<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.210> but

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
them when they actually built it but

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.930 
them when they actually built it but
anyway<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:11.070> bedroom<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.670> a<00:05:11.730> nice

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
anyway this is a bedroom to a nice

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.150 
anyway this is a bedroom to a nice
lime-green<00:05:12.570> bedroom<00:05:13.410> design<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.890> don't<00:05:14.100> know

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
lime-green bedroom design I don't know

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.830 
lime-green bedroom design I don't know
what<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.520> maybe<00:05:14.730> like<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:15.060> cupboard<00:05:15.300> kind

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
what this is maybe like a cupboard kind

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.620 
what this is maybe like a cupboard kind
of<00:05:15.930> shelving<00:05:16.350> area<00:05:16.590> up<00:05:16.950> there<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.520> like<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.480> bed

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
of shelving area up there I like the bed

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.360 
of shelving area up there I like the bed
in<00:05:18.750> awesome<00:05:19.470> bed<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:20.040> what<00:05:20.280> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
in awesome bed and then what the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.130 
in awesome bed and then what the
pictures<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:20.820> match<00:05:21.000> over<00:05:21.300> there<00:05:21.330> really

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
pictures to match over there really

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.160 
pictures to match over there really
really<00:05:22.410> nice<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.890> we<00:05:22.980> go<00:05:23.130> over<00:05:23.400> here<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.300> this

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
really nice and we go over here and this

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.990 
really nice and we go over here and this
is<00:05:25.470> another<00:05:25.980> bedroom<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.460> I'm<00:05:26.550> guessing<00:05:26.940> this

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
is another bedroom so I'm guessing this

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.880 
is another bedroom so I'm guessing this
is<00:05:27.060> probably<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.600> house<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:28.320> Zingo<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.800> his

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
is probably the house that Zingo and his

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.130 
is probably the house that Zingo and his
brother<00:05:29.220> would<00:05:29.460> live<00:05:29.700> in<00:05:29.850> if<00:05:30.060> they<00:05:30.300> moved<00:05:30.960> out

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
brother would live in if they moved out

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.690 
brother would live in if they moved out
together<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:31.890> don't<00:05:32.160> know<00:05:32.370> whose<00:05:32.520> bedroom

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
together so I don't know whose bedroom

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.080 
together so I don't know whose bedroom
this<00:05:32.940> would<00:05:33.090> be<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.630> maybe<00:05:33.930> be<00:05:35.090> dingos

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
this would be this maybe be dingos

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.420 
this would be this maybe be dingos
bedroom<00:05:36.480> and<00:05:36.660> this<00:05:36.720> will<00:05:36.900> maybe<00:05:37.080> be<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.680> bedroom

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
bedroom and this will maybe be a bedroom

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.750 
bedroom and this will maybe be a bedroom
I<00:05:38.820> think<00:05:39.680> yeah<00:05:40.680> let's<00:05:41.010> go<00:05:41.160> with<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.460> so<00:05:41.640> we've
