00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.120
 Talk galera, welcome to another video of the Channel Rapel League 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.110
 This time I will teach you how to do a self-insurance 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.060
 the self-insurance is in case you drop your rope in abseiling 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.060
 You're locked automatically This is a practice I do not use 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 I'll explain why: In waterfalls for example if I get stuck in the rope, I can finish 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.550
 drowning me So if in case you are going to use an auto insurance, 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.949
 be very cautious What you will need: 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.949
 You will need a cordelete of approximately 2m with a Double Fisherman joining the two ends 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.499
 and a carabiner The carabiner you will pass on your leg, 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:54.499
 on your Leg Loop It should be passed on the side you use 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.620
 If you are right-handed, you should 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.510
 pass in the right leg loop If in case you are left handed, you should pass 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.040
 in the left leg loop You should then pick up your cordelete 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 and make a Prussik or Machard on your rope With the Prussik or Machard created, you will 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.460
 make the normal passage on your brake 9 and attach what is left of your cordelete in the carabiner 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.090
 that you put on the Leg Loop Always remembering to close your carabiner 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.890
 With it strapped to your waist, you'll already have your auto insurance system ready 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.280
 So you just hold on to it, leaving the knot a little loose to effect 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.640
 your descent As you go down, if you 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.930
 release your brake, your Prussik or your Machard will hang on the rope, leaving you stuck 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.660
 just by the leg This is a very simple self-insurance system 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.270
 I do not recommend people who do not have much experience to use this, as this 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 An accident with you may end up happening. 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 There are people who like and know how to use, so this video is just a database 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.010
 future research will show, other means of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.370
 do a self-insurance If you liked this video do not forget 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.529
