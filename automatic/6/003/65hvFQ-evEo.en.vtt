00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.820
 I see that you consider therefore 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.150
 appreciation there like appreciation 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 of the beauty of this art and and so who 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.130
 know of the culture is not necessarily 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.320
 necessary because we consider that the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.090
 beauty is something that one of 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.020
 did in my concerts from the youngest 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.960
 age 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.240
 here the respondent makes the choice of 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.090
 start his intervention with a 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.250
 summary of the developed position 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.200
 convincing it's a good idea 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.510
 a good strategy that allows you to enter 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.879
 quietly in the second phase of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.489
 exercise 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.790
 in itself this is true but I think that 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.840
 art is not limited to its beauty and I 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.520
 think that's exactly where 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.470
 what comes the culture that comes 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.330
 complete the passing of beauty on 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.059
 sees in contemporary art for example 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.550
 where some offers are not necessarily 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.160
 beautiful but there is an originality or a 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.200
 message that has passed and which does not 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.060
 not limit to its beauty and so to my 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.310
 notice here the culture comes into play and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.130
 allows to appreciate this art which 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.460
 represented how do you think 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 here the respondent has just presented a 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.350
 objection is very quickly it makes 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.930
 speech or convincing she's right 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.820
 to do it because the trap for the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.890
 respondents would be to embark on a 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.500
 tunnel of speech in a monologue in 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.899
 a counter- statement is not at all 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 who is expected from the respondent the goal at 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.420
 opposite is to create a dialogue 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.729
 so be careful not to monopolize the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.069
 word when you speak in 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.209
 as long as you answer 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.000
 originality but is it 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:59.259
 originality she herself did not have 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 not beautiful in itself I mean we can 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.970
 to be one can be original is beautiful but 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.769
 original is less beautiful and I think 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.239
 the original works is that in 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.380
 snow shelters are highlighted by 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.760
 their originality 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.209
 but the bo is implied nevertheless 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.569
 so I forget that definition of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.299
 beauty 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.489
 so in originality and voice but a 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.739
 again in the works 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.989
 contemporary for example we see 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.319
 sometimes he had a work there was 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.950
 an exhibition in paris on very 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.349
 natural or 1 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.489
 an artist decided to let nature 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.010
 do and so helping for example in 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.440
 exposing food who was who 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.370
 was rotting and 7 7 6 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.660
 matches which was still 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.150
 really not very beautiful and silent and enel 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.250
 works of art puts a living nature 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.319
 it was alive and yet it was not 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.390
 not nice and it was still dollar 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.239
 in there you see the beauty intervene 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.220
 really in appreciation of here it is 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.069
 almost two minutes as candidates 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.650
 are completely off topic they 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.480
 are debating the definition of the beautiful but 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.660
 they completely lost sight of the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.030
 question asked to know should one be 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.799
 cultivated to appreciate art in a 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.069
 debate that lasts five minutes 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.769
 it's criminal to lose two minutes to 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.110
 which can be considered a 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.180
 necessary preliminary definition of the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.660
 beautiful but has no place in a 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.660
 such debate 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.010
 maybe it's still 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.160
 maybe Muslim world saying that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.750
 art is something that evolves in 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.020
 the time and so maybe the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.190
 beauty criteria are changing 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.080
 I can not say what are the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:53.310
 beauty criteria today but I 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.310
 suppose the population unconsciously 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.020
 we have it we know seven criteria of these 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.510
 beauty criteria but that they are them 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 not even able to define on the idea 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.470
 of such that he has beauty at the end of 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.940
 count in food to agree 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.870
 I find it hard to be sure 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.210
 point of view but I think that's 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 our definition throws to each of the 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:20.860
 beauty that opposes us but on the idea 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.880
 that art and trading evolved I'm 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.680
 totally agree but what 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.230
 precisely at that moment the culture does not 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.140
 not allow to appreciate the art nouveau by 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.430
 relationship to ancient art by already having 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.010
 knowledge about what was done 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.730
 traditionally where there are some 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.530
 only years 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.840
 does not that exactly 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.550
 to appreciate more or less the rambo and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.860
 so serer culture is coming back again 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.990
 once 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.240
 the question of the culture of the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.599
 need to be cultivated to appreciate 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.789
 resurfaced in the debate thanks to 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.219
 the respondent is her 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.580
 the merit of having reframed the 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:58.169
 discussions on the subject only she 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.879
 should have done it earlier two minutes 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.430
 were lost effect two minutes and is 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.770
 precious 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.870
 it's true that to appreciate things 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.530
 who evolve and finally as has by 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.560
 example, it would be favorable to have 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.340
 pre-established knowledge so the cut of 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.490
 culture to better judge better ecsta 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.199
 but still, it can only be 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.930
 I think it's just a simple 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:28.529
 contribution is not necessarily necessary 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.819
 someone who is completely lacking 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:34.439
 of any culture can still 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:36.270
 appreciate the works of art is 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.949
 by the way to go further in the 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.759
 reasoning I think it takes my 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.159
 third argument the in view of 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.949
 the evolution of art to be able 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:50.150
 the maximum enjoyment of its assets 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:54.000
 spare years one would have to know 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.169
 all you need to progress star 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.960
 but that's not possible 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.449
 and so I think that as I ai 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.889
 says the individuals who want to appreciate 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.729
 that one had to appreciate the art must 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:08.759
 really make an effort to try to 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.509
 2 will appreciate this at a zero level of 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:14.540
 culture and I think I will conclude 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.180
 right now 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.280
 at the end of the debate it's up to the convincing 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.710
 it's up to conclude he's supposed 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.170
 do it just a little before the flow 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.540
 of five minutes and he is supposed to say 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.860
 in this quick conclusion what the 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.260
 debate allowed to bring in the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.640
 solving the problem here the 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.440
 convincing the fact probably a little 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.870
 too soon he does it at 4 minutes 20 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.910
 is it forbidden to the respondent? 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.890
 to bring a new idea a 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.670
 new objection while it remained 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.670
 40 seconds 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.520
 so I agree that the 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.580
 definition of that appreciation of 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.730
 art is there then the appreciation of the bo 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.960
 can cause problems at the level of 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:03.380
 even definition of the beautiful I find that 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:09.140
 of fans the example of the exhibition was 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:12.160
 interesting and so we have a disagreement 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.160
 are you from this definition 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.080
 here is one of the bars 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.880
 balanced in terms of distribution of 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.620
 speaking time even if a convincing 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.440
 tendency to keep speech too 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.940
 long at the end of the discussion 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.400
 big problem in this debate the 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.470
 off-topic two minutes lost in 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.570
 considerations on the definition of the bo 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.550
 far too far from the question 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.350
 question and the question of the culture of 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.190
 the need for culture to 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.060
 appreciate the art the respondent has 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.460
 relatively well played his role 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.660
 from the moment she reframed the 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.660
 discussion in the right direction
