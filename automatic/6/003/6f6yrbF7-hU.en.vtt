 for example with a mixer well, finally I 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.550
 tell you and their sound is shorter 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.700
 headphones give a pretty high quality 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.019
 sound bass sound very good 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.560
 in the car 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.830
 you zaebaty but not all stands out 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.980
 how high frequencies should sound too 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.260
 very good and clean in the end it turns out 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.200
 very good realistic and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.180
 quality sound for the price it is 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.840
 just great headphones 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.750
 there are those that cost twice as much 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.960
 more expensive and the sound quality of the assembly and 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.360
 materials rare shit 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.840
 Well, as we know the ideal things are not 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.540
 happens everybody has their flaws so 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.390
 I personally have these headphones 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.210
 revealed only one drawback is the sound 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.740
 high volume permeability then 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.770
 I have what I listen to 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.920
 hear everyone around me bring 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.460
 example imagine i'm listening to extreme 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.610
 metal 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.550
 for example in the bus and next to the evil granny 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.820
 she pays a hundred percent to me 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.790
 words with gem evil cursed in general 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.790
 These are normal headphones. I do not regret that I 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.650
 I bought them well, sort of all I wanted 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.630
