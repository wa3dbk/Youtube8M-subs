00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the same idea here what happens is you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.120 
the same idea here what happens is you
have<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> cannon<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.470> will<00:00:31.650> shoot<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
have this cannon that will shoot out a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.729 
have this cannon that will shoot out a
color<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.630> match<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.140> over<00:00:34.410> here

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
color and you have to match it over here

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.360 
color and you have to match it over here
and<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.910> hits<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.510> color<00:00:37.489> as

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
and make sure it hits the right color as

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
and make sure it hits the right color as
you<00:00:41.370> progress<00:00:41.610> through<00:00:41.850> each<00:00:42.420> level<00:00:42.450> they'll

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you progress through each level they'll

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
you progress through each level they'll
become<00:00:43.530> harder<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.160> harder<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:45.180> more

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
become harder and harder with more

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410 
become harder and harder with more
colored<00:00:45.930> sections<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.800> also<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:47.969> various

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
colored sections and also some various

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.350 
colored sections and also some various
power-ups<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.379> shrink<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.579> size<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
power-ups that can shrink the size of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.310 
power-ups that can shrink the size of
the<00:00:51.600> whole<00:00:52.190> circle<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.430> also<00:00:54.270> swap<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.899> colors

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the whole circle or also swap the colors

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 
the whole circle or also swap the colors
and<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> miss<00:00:56.460> you'll<00:00:56.789> lose<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.239> life

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and if you miss you'll lose one life

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.299 
and if you miss you'll lose one life
from<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.530> there<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> game<00:01:01.980> becomes

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
from up there so the game becomes

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
from up there so the game becomes
actually<00:01:02.969> pretty<00:01:03.300> challenging<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
actually pretty challenging as you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.730 
actually pretty challenging as you
progress<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:06.170> all<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.409> different

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
progress and all the different

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.830 
progress and all the different
variations<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.700> challenges<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.420> really

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
variations and challenges are really

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
variations and challenges are really
nice<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.310> scoring<00:01:11.729> system<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
nice and the scoring system there is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
nice and the scoring system there is
really<00:01:12.720> great<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.560> combo<00:01:14.100> meter

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
really great has a little combo meter

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.969 
really great has a little combo meter
there<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.900> visuals<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.860> nice

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
there and the visuals are really nice

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.640 
there and the visuals are really nice
even<00:01:17.400> though<00:01:17.520> they're<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:17.970> simple<00:01:18.650> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
even though they're pretty simple the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.789 
even though they're pretty simple the
visual<00:01:20.400> effects<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:22.080> song<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
visual effects when you get song in the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.800 
visual effects when you get song in the
right<00:01:22.979> color<00:01:23.280> pull<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.600> whole<00:01:24.780> thing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
right color pull the whole thing

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
right color pull the whole thing
illuminates<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.060> there's<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
illuminates there and there's that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
illuminates there and there's that
little<00:01:27.360> effect<00:01:27.840> down<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
little effect down there and it just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
little effect down there and it just
looks<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.130> great<00:01:29.509> however<00:01:30.509> sometimes<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
looks really great however sometimes the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.100 
looks really great however sometimes the
frame<00:01:31.530> rate<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:32.100> stutter<00:01:32.579> slightly<00:01:33.240> when

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
frame rate does stutter slightly when

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.830 
frame rate does stutter slightly when
you're<00:01:34.490> especially<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:36.630> you're<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you're especially in your when you're in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.390 
you're especially in your when you're in
the<00:01:36.960> tougher<00:01:37.350> levels<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> you're

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the tougher levels there and you're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
the tougher levels there and you're
trying<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> move<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.270> place<00:01:39.650> it'll

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
trying to move it in place it'll

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.130 
trying to move it in place it'll
sometimes<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> few<00:01:41.880> frames<00:01:42.150> but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sometimes get the few frames but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.560 
sometimes get the few frames but
otherwise<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:43.710> good<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
otherwise it's really good and the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
otherwise it's really good and the
controls<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.380> basic<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.070> slide<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
controls are really basic just slide the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.660 
controls are really basic just slide the
circle<00:01:48.210> around<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.920> ball<00:01:50.159> hit<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
circle around and make the ball hit the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.600 
circle around and make the ball hit the
circle<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.360> place<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.189> as<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.369> see

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
circle in the right place and as you see

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.999 
circle in the right place and as you see
your<00:01:53.880> score<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> totaled<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.590> then

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
your score is totaled up there and then

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
your score is totaled up there and then
you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> move<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> next<00:01:57.000> level<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you can move on to the next level and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.130 
you can move on to the next level and
you<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> try<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> get<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.869> far<00:02:00.869> as

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you just have to try to get as far as

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.719 
you just have to try to get as far as
possible<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.950> these<00:02:02.159> levels<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:04.729> there's

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
possible in these levels here there's

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.809 
possible in these levels here there's
also<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.619> time<00:02:07.619> trial<00:02:07.950> mode<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
also the time trial mode here in the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.749 
also the time trial mode here in the
main<00:02:09.000> menu

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
main menu

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.640 
main menu
and<00:02:10.879> that'll<00:02:11.659> just<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.989> even<00:02:12.349> more

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
and that'll just be even more

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.880 
and that'll just be even more
challenging<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:14.510> personally<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.319> think<00:02:15.409> this

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
challenging like personally I think this

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.809 
challenging like personally I think this
time<00:02:15.950> trial<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.579> almost<00:02:16.670> impossible<00:02:18.670> goes<00:02:19.670> at

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
time trial is almost impossible goes at

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.500 
time trial is almost impossible goes at
a<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:20.299> fast<00:02:20.569> pace<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:22.000> there's<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.090> lot<00:02:23.480> of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
a really fast pace and there's a lot of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.569 
a really fast pace and there's a lot of
color<00:02:23.900> sections<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.769> sometimes<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.370> kind<00:02:25.459> of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
color sections and sometimes it kind of

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.509 
color sections and sometimes it kind of
just<00:02:25.730> randomly<00:02:26.269> shoots<00:02:26.659> the<00:02:26.989> ball<00:02:27.230> out<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.430> you

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
just randomly shoots the ball out so you

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.610 
just randomly shoots the ball out so you
just<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.360> react<00:02:29.810> extremely

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
just really have to react extremely

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.740 
just really have to react extremely
quickly<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.790> also<00:02:31.909> have<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.209> dodge<00:02:32.480> those

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
quickly and you also have to dodge those

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.750 
quickly and you also have to dodge those
holes<00:02:33.260> there<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.890> will<00:02:34.040> block<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.610> ball

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
holes there that will block the ball

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:47.240 
holes there that will block the ball
from<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.269> in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.710 

so<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.430> game<00:02:48.640> probably<00:02:48.970> has<00:02:49.180> some<00:02:49.450> really

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so this game probably has some really

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.530 
so this game probably has some really
great<00:02:50.050> lasting<00:02:50.620> value<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:51.340> my<00:02:51.909> opinion<00:02:51.940> at

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
great lasting value in my opinion at

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420 
great lasting value in my opinion at
least<00:02:52.569> because<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.650> keep<00:02:53.830> on<00:02:53.980> playing<00:02:54.310> it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
least because you can keep on playing it

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.509 
least because you can keep on playing it
as<00:02:54.610> long<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.390> want<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.799> challenging

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
as long as you want and it's challenging

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.149 
as long as you want and it's challenging
enough<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.269> stays<00:02:58.720> exciting<00:02:59.440> after<00:03:00.129> a

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
enough that it stays exciting after a

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.270 
enough that it stays exciting after a
long<00:03:00.430> time<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:02.260> game<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.620> unique<00:03:03.010> enough

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
long time and the game is unique enough

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.369 
long time and the game is unique enough

that it's just really cool to play and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.339 
it's definitely worth downloading if you

one<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.709> best<00:03:11.860> games<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.610> I've<00:03:13.150> seen<00:03:13.540> in

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
one of the best games that I've seen in

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.690 
one of the best games that I've seen in
a<00:03:13.810> while<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.500> developer<00:03:17.890> fixes<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
a while if the developer fixes the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.960 
a while if the developer fixes the
occasional<00:03:19.510> lag<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:20.260> frame<00:03:20.799> rate<00:03:21.040> as<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.790> saw

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970

occasional lag in frame rate as you saw
a<00:03:22.000> bit<00:03:22.269> earlier<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:22.870> i<00:03:22.959> was<00:03:23.079> playing<00:03:23.260> this

then the game would be absolutely
perfect<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.549> still<00:03:27.760> pretty<00:03:27.819> good<00:03:28.299> and
