 not the brain is divided before the left hemisphere the hemisphere 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.459
 straight 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.719
 the latter works through the reason I hope to draw that is illogical

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.939
 ambition 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.359
 and this year 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.509
 the left hemisphere of the brain is that of mathematics 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.529
 the analysis 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.529
 masculinity 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.750
 time 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.390
 and work 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.240
 the right hemisphere is associated with intuition is related to the 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.890
 divergent thinking euro imagine who 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.820
 non-linear metaphorical your goal 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.630
 and concentrates on the everything of the things the right hemisphere controls the side 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.770
 left of the body 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.780
 while those who set out on the other hand and right side 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.220
 structural level after a research process with diverse 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.660
 materials and prototypes 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.950
 the most suitable form was found 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.100
 chilingárov own languages ​​for the user that object called taxes 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.189
 consists 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.189
 a series of ways that allows generating a different environment 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.740
 the blue triangle represents the body as a point of balance and is a 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.400
 attractive figure 30 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.080
 intellect creativity 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.270
 to this central triangle according to him two triangles plus pacts cranks of 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.460
 orange color inverco accompanied by four were of them and an axis of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 rotation the cranks are located in opposite directions 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.350
 which represent the two in mysteries of the brain in this way has three 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.430
 holes that denote the level of complexity of the exercise since 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.370
 about the axis the movement is more closed 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.750
 therefore more difficult to perform 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.370
 the colors used and experiential to the two hemispheres the orange break free 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.560
 negative emotions while green gives a feeling of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.880
 relaxation and tranquility 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.940
 which allows a balance between the controls to allow another level of 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.490
 intensity and experience 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 at the time of playing with the simple one besides generating a visual stability in the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.240
 design all these elements that make up the synthetic is located on 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.470
 a transparent base kevin gage firmness and neutrality 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.070
 at a conceptual level in relation to the other values 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.790
 in relation to the user 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.569
 the cinema has three levels so pajín 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.420
 the middle and in the spot we start with the case introducing the index fingers in 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.440
 the buildings equal the cranks at the same height and we start playing 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.530
 making smooth movements later and another one backwards those 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.610
 movements or we repeat twenty-one times in a sense twenty-one times in the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.420
 common sense put it is advisable to play with the synth between two four 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.509
 times per day 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:55.959
 remember that you can 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 gat those exercises with all your fingers in your hand 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.929
 then we do the same procedure with the intermediate level and with the level 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:04.749
 advanced 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:08.559
 not so much the closer to the shaft is more difficult very well 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.290
 to change the exercise we use the maimed we perform the same steps as 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.939
 with the fingers 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.939
 last week week 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.039
 these photographs show various angles of the area 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 from above 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.739
 The following figures show the essential relative size of the 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.429
 hands and not
