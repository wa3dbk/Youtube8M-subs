00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:10.299
 and what's up everybody talks to them mark mex 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.889
 and guys today I bring you a topic that 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.019
 has been intriguing in the last days 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.510
 let's say it has been like a pebble in 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.060
 the shoe but before the bottom they are 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.800
 watching a game excessively fail 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.680
 as you can see it is demolition in oct still 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.250
 and the truth is that in this game this 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.390
 it's super super super close to get me out 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.570
 many more than 100 record casualties that 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.160
 well minimum about 130 or 120 casualties so 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.470
 I would have been very good unfortunately 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.360
 in the end I made a mistake in kindergarten 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.000
 it was a super absurd mistake I think 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.579
 which is the most absolute error that I have 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.020
 committed until now because let's say 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.079
 it's okay to kill you it 's good that you 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.820
 kill I do not know by one hand or something like that but what 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.110
 what will they see is going to be a mistake still 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.360
 much worse I think I'm going to 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.430
 command to take each sip well because 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.710
 I thought that if we won the round we were going to 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.230
 tie the game so he's doing 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.450
 until the impossible to win that damn 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 round we even win them thanks to me 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.009
 they get later bully I do not know me the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.990
 game super very much and killed those who 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.549
 they are reinforcing the pump and so 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.869
 it turns out that I did not realize that 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.000
 we had won a round I forgot 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.490
 completely and then the only thing we did 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.990
 is to win the game and I already had the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.090
 be habitual and hungry for 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.789
 next round so in an error 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.280
 super super super kinder truth and 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.409
 well Basso did not say the subject as you know 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.970
 it comes in games like gta 5 watch 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.619
 stocks for 2004 dead rising 36 road 4 and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.170
 well despite the fact that the saga of call of 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.970
 duty is my favorite course of course 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.710
 like other games like the ones I just 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.659
 to mention even though I do not know my 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.880
 main channel this super super 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.319
 focused on I do not know at this moment black 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.750
 ops 2 that in the end is call of 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.209
 duty however the theme of the variety 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.700
 and all this I think it would go a little 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.740
 in conflict with the channel's slogan between 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.509
 quotes that as you can see the motto of 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.670
 my channel is your number one channel in call 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.409
 of duty and well I do not know the truth 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 suffocating a lot of call of free because 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.159
 It really is a game that I'm good at 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.319
 games that I love very much that we 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.599
 I enjoy a lot and I do not know 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.099
 pretty well and I do not know if they have 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.560
 managed to be the number one channel in 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.269
 color and at least mexico that the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.900
 truth is that I would be very happy that 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.790
 If so, 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.890
 let's say that the subject of the variety then 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.720
 it would not be this one with anything else would not be 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.840
 many other games like those that I just 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.939
 to mention however this issue of the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.180
 variety pleases me quite in spite of 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.879
 which conflicts with some things 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.409
 let's say I 'll bring more games I'll keep 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.450
 rising mostly with those of 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:40.109
 orito had thought to do a kind of 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.959
 gta schedule so watch Monday 5 Tuesday 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:46.379
 dogs Wednesday call of duty Thursday for 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.940
 the end 4 Friday dead rising or 6 road 4 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.099
 and Saturday and Sunday with both and of 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.329
 new is an idea nothing else I'm not 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.069
 saying that it's going to be the schedule that 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.459
 already but more or less like that I would like 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.709
 organize it for days a different game 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.209
 while continuing to super follow 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.549
 climbing mostly call of duty 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.170
 many have been telling me to do 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.180
 that is, this theme of the variety in my 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.519
 second channel but the truth is not me 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.530
 like because I want that channel or 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.810
 be the my second channel be more focused 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.069
 other kind of games that we say do not have 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.049
 nothing to do with violence or with 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.819
 shooting or anything like that and I'm going too 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.840
 to focus much more on blogs that I have 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.019
 a pretty idea 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.340
 innovative blogging so that's why 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.050
 I would like to know your opinion 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.400
 guys that make your opinion and you 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.560
 is for me they are the most important thing in this 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.300
 channel so I do not know what you think the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.970
 theme of the variety in this channel already 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.910
 I say those games like gta 5 watch tops 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.370
 bardos field 4 dead rising 36 row are 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.590
 the ones that I keep thinking the same and there 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.690
 many more but come on they think 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.040

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.860
 channel and do well as a kind of 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.720
