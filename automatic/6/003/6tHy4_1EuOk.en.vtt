00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.350
 hello today I propose you to 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.080
 discover how to make an apple 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.360
 historical windmill the apple of 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.010
 touline served to ballast the end 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.869
 a rope to be launched 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.580
 you will see that it is not very 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.980
 complicated in the end to make an apple 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.410
 of a windmill to make an apple of 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.230
 touline just describe three 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.020
 circles around the soul so stuck 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.600
 labit between your fingers 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.839
 and then realize the number of laps 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.010
 necessary in order to be able to hide at 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.400
 final to the soul 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.519
 in this case here four rounds we 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.920
 realized the first circle 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:59.339
 we make a turn to achieve the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.339
 second circle 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.740
 and you will now have to do the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.720
 memo same number of turns as 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.720
 previously so to know four rounds 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 the most difficult at the beginning being to 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.229
 not to bring down the live 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.930
 it's a question of dexterity but that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.320
 you will acquire acquire enough 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.320
 quickly 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.250
 so we realized the second 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.259
 circle we will achieve the third 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.729
 circle by making a turn and that's it 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.030
 third circles that will hold 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.030
 all 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.710
 no 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.810
 surrounds a second is realized there 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.810
 four more rounds 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.390
 need if the rope does not go over 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.890
 help yourself from the cob evening tool 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 indispensable in seamanship 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.099
 once again there are four towers 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.220
 realized we could not do it again 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.890
 tightening and tightening 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.900
 it's tricky you have to go all 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.310
 gently start with a ready tightening 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.640
 and do not hesitate to make a second one 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 even a third trial rage it's not 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.140
 very complicated just start from a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.140
 end to finish at the other 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.390
 that said to stay very focused because we 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.390
 can quickly lose the thread 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.290
 we serve the first circle 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.180
 go for it sweet at first 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.350
 we will soon move to the second circle 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.470
 necessarily the first slug 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.690
 that you will realize did not remember 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.699
 the most successful but certainly does not want 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.060
 get discouraged while doing another 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.060
 the stride 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.939
 historically the slug apples 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.789
 was used to ballast the end of a 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.710
 rope so he can launch it so he 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.840
 was not necessary to put a soul 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.150
 inside as far as 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.280
 today it's apples have become 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.389
 decorative 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 it is still more interesting 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.219
 put a ball a lady boul what 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.719
 you finally want to have something 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.719
 pretty aesthetic lunel 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.840
 we are back to the starting point 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.840
 the other apple is dominating is over
