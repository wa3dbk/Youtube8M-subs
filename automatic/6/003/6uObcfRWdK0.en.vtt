have enough Tomatoes I want to I want to
remove<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.340> okay<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.480> now<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.690> we've

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
remove that okay so now that we've

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780 
remove that okay so now that we've
identified<00:02:15.080> what<00:02:15.799> blossom<00:02:16.190> end<00:02:16.310> rot<00:02:16.370> looks

identified what blossom end rot looks

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.430 
identified what blossom end rot looks
like<00:02:17.030> how<00:02:17.569> do<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:17.750> prevent<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.319> from

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
like how do we prevent this from

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.740 
like how do we prevent this from
happening<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:19.489> best<00:02:19.790> way<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.030> prevent<00:02:20.420> is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
happening the best way to prevent is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.410 
happening the best way to prevent is
again<00:02:21.019> preventing<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.549> key<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
again preventing is that is the key the

again preventing is that is the key the
best<00:02:23.900> way<00:02:24.110> most<00:02:24.440> likely<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:26.120> use<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.630> high

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
best way most likely is to use a high

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.190 
best way most likely is to use a high

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
you should dump out your soil start

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.449 
you should dump out your soil start
fresh<00:02:56.720> every<00:02:57.019> year<00:02:57.260> or<00:02:57.530> your<00:02:57.620> potting<00:02:57.980> mix<00:02:58.190> I

fresh every year or your potting mix I

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.940 
fresh every year or your potting mix I
disagree<00:02:59.269> with<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.630> if<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.440> don't<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.769> any

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
disagree with that if you don't have any

plant diseases per say I like to some

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.500 
plant diseases per say I like to some
use<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.680> same<00:03:04.010> boxes<00:03:04.489> over<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.150> over<00:03:05.389> again

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
use the same boxes over and over again

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.420 
use the same boxes over and over again
for<00:03:05.780> my<00:03:05.900> tomatoes<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.500> peppers<00:03:06.620> because<00:03:07.250> I

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
for my tomatoes and peppers because I

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.129 
for my tomatoes and peppers because I
like<00:03:07.639> to<00:03:07.850> accumulate<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.569> amount<00:03:09.019> of

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
like to accumulate that amount of

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.720 
like to accumulate that amount of
dolomite<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:09.920> like<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.130> add<00:03:10.340> my<00:03:10.370> new

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
dolomite in it I like to add my new

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.789 
dolomite in it I like to add my new
dolomite<00:03:11.180> every<00:03:11.420> year<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.650> that

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
dolomite every year and I think that

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.910 
dolomite every year and I think that
really<00:03:13.250> helps<00:03:13.670> control<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.209> video<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:15.410> if<00:03:15.739> I'm

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
really helps control the video so if I'm

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.680 
really helps control the video so if I'm
hearing<00:03:16.519> correctly<00:03:16.670> what<00:03:17.120> you're<00:03:17.150> saying<00:03:17.480> if

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
hearing correctly what you're saying if

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.140 
hearing correctly what you're saying if
you're<00:03:17.989> planning<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.739> box<00:03:18.920> fresh<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.940> should

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
you're planning a box fresh we should

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.699 
you're planning a box fresh we should
really<00:03:20.329> try<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.720> watch<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.200> little<00:03:21.350> bit<00:03:21.560> more

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
really try to watch a little bit more

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.470 
really try to watch a little bit more
closely<00:03:21.980> for<00:03:22.579> blossom<00:03:22.910> end<00:03:23.060> rot<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.329> might

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
closely for blossom end rot you might

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.970 
closely for blossom end rot you might
have<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.660> little<00:03:23.810> bit<00:03:23.989> more<00:03:24.109> chance<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:24.829> it

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
have a little bit more chance to get it

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.680 
have a little bit more chance to get it
on<00:03:25.400> your<00:03:25.459> first<00:03:25.760> planting<00:03:26.239> rather<00:03:26.389> than<00:03:26.540> your

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
on your first planting rather than your

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.210 
on your first planting rather than your
third<00:03:26.900> or<00:03:27.049> fourth<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.530> would<00:03:27.799> say<00:03:27.950> that's<00:03:28.130> true

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
third or fourth I would say that's true

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.809 
third or fourth I would say that's true
okay<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:29.500> now<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.530> we<00:03:30.920> have<00:03:31.130> whassamatter<00:03:31.639> on

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
okay so now that we have whassamatter on

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.129 
okay so now that we have whassamatter on
how<00:03:31.970> do<00:03:32.030> we<00:03:32.180> cure<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.599> problem<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.049> it

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
how do we cure this problem is it

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.379 
how do we cure this problem is it
curable<00:03:33.410> or<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.859> our<00:03:34.040> season<00:03:34.519> lost<00:03:34.760> no<00:03:35.209> it's

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
curable or is our season lost no it's

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.479 
curable or is our season lost no it's
definitely<00:03:35.569> curable<00:03:36.319> again<00:03:36.709> reaction<00:03:37.280> time

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
definitely curable again reaction time

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.069 
definitely curable again reaction time
is<00:03:37.609> kind<00:03:37.819> of<00:03:37.910> critical<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.540> would<00:03:38.720> say<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
is kind of critical I would say the

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.020 
is kind of critical I would say the
earlier<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.889> can<00:03:40.040> catch<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.579> better

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
earlier you can catch it the better

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.970 
earlier you can catch it the better
my<00:03:41.540> suggestion<00:03:42.049> is<00:03:42.260> remove

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
my suggestion is remove

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.130 
my suggestion is remove
the<00:03:43.790> effective<00:03:44.270> fruit<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:44.720> again<00:03:44.930> not

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
the effective fruit but again not

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.530 
the effective fruit but again not
necessary<00:03:45.800> but<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> cure-all<00:03:47.090> but

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
necessary but I do have a cure-all but

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.059 
necessary but I do have a cure-all but
it's<00:03:47.629> a<00:03:47.690> one<00:03:47.930> time<00:03:48.140> it's<00:03:48.410> not<00:03:48.530> shouldn't<00:03:48.890> be

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
it's a one time it's not shouldn't be

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.670 
it's a one time it's not shouldn't be
used<00:03:49.280> as<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.459> preventative<00:03:50.060> because<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
used as a preventative because it is a a

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.229 
used as a preventative because it is a a
line<00:03:52.010> product<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.550> we're<00:03:52.670> going<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.849> use<00:03:53.060> it

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
line product that we're going to use it

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.759 
line product that we're going to use it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
don't have to but we do have a pretty

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.509 
don't have to but we do have a pretty
good<00:04:00.530> solution<00:04:01.430> little<00:04:02.319> stop<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.650> control

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
good solution little stop and control

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.430 
good solution little stop and control
the<00:04:04.610> BER<00:04:04.910> very<00:04:05.269> quickly<00:04:05.540> okay<00:04:05.989> why<00:04:06.290> don't<00:04:06.349> you

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
the BER very quickly okay why don't you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.970 
the BER very quickly okay why don't you
show<00:04:06.620> me<00:04:06.650> what<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:06.860> is<00:04:06.980> okay<00:04:08.860> what<00:04:09.860> we're

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
show me what that is okay what we're

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.559 
show me what that is okay what we're
going<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.160> do<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.580> we're<00:04:10.760> going<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.030> use<00:04:11.360> our

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
going to do is we're going to use our

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.839 
going to do is we're going to use our
special<00:04:11.840> formula<00:04:12.470> which<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.709> 1/4<00:04:13.459> cup<00:04:13.670> of

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
special formula which is 1/4 cup of

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.750 
special formula which is 1/4 cup of
hydrated<00:04:14.690> lime<00:04:14.959> in<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.319> gallon<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.739> water<00:04:15.799> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
hydrated lime in a gallon of water and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.759 
hydrated lime in a gallon of water and
again<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.060> can't<00:04:17.389> say<00:04:17.570> this<00:04:17.720> enough<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
again I can't say this enough this is a

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.390 
again I can't say this enough this is a
one-time<00:04:19.400> fix<00:04:19.700> if<00:04:20.299> you<00:04:20.900> see<00:04:21.169> BER<00:04:21.620> again<00:04:22.040> don't

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
one-time fix if you see BER again don't

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.670 
one-time fix if you see BER again don't
do<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.669> again<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.240> one-time<00:04:23.810> only<00:04:23.840> one

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
do it again this is a one-time only one

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.730 
do it again this is a one-time only one
application<00:04:25.370> per<00:04:25.400> season<00:04:25.940> ok<00:04:26.479> so<00:04:27.020> what<00:04:27.590> we

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
application per season ok so what we

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.969 
application per season ok so what we
suggest<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:29.210> hydrated<00:04:30.110> lime<00:04:30.290> which<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.950> a

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
suggest is hydrated lime which is a

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.090 
suggest is hydrated lime which is a
quick<00:04:31.490> lime<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.419> is<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.780> caustic<00:04:33.290> material<00:04:33.830> one

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
quick lime it is a caustic material one

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.040 
quick lime it is a caustic material one
of<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.250> difficulties<00:04:34.880> people<00:04:35.540> have<00:04:35.780> had<00:04:35.900> in

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
of the difficulties people have had in

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.840 
of the difficulties people have had in
the<00:04:36.110> past<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.620> normally<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.310> sold<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:37.790> an

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
the past is normally that is sold in an

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.500 
the past is normally that is sold in an
80<00:04:38.060> pound<00:04:38.300> bag<00:04:38.570> well<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.500> need<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> quarter<00:04:40.040> cup

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
80 pound bag well you need a quarter cup

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.379 
80 pound bag well you need a quarter cup
so<00:04:41.510> pickling<00:04:42.200> lime<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.850> same<00:04:44.090> thing<00:04:44.270> as

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
so pickling lime is the same thing as

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.719 
so pickling lime is the same thing as
hydrated<00:04:44.930> or<00:04:45.050> quick<00:04:45.260> line<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.580> buy<00:04:46.700> a

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
hydrated or quick line you can buy a

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.730 
hydrated or quick line you can buy a
kick<00:04:46.970> lean<00:04:47.150> line<00:04:47.330> if<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.780> go<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.960> any<00:04:48.229> store

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
kick lean line if you go to any store

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.680 
kick lean line if you go to any store
basically<00:04:49.430> grocery<00:04:50.090> stores

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
basically grocery stores

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.500 
basically grocery stores
Walmart's<00:04:51.590> farm<00:04:52.070> stores<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.760> some<00:04:53.210> garden

Walmart's farm stores and some garden

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.450 
Walmart's farm stores and some garden
centers<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:53.960> sell<00:04:54.139> canning<00:04:54.530> supplies<00:04:54.889> you

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
centers that sell canning supplies you

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.520 
centers that sell canning supplies you
can<00:04:55.490> find<00:04:55.850> pickling<00:04:56.210> line<00:04:56.389> so<00:04:57.260> what<00:04:57.380> we're

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
can find pickling line so what we're

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.390 
can find pickling line so what we're
going<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.680> do<00:04:57.889> is<00:04:58.070> we're<00:04:58.160> going<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.340> buy

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
going to do is we're going to buy

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.610 
going to do is we're going to buy
pickling<00:04:58.820> lime<00:04:59.000> we're<00:04:59.600> going<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.810> use<00:04:59.990> 1/4<00:05:00.470> cup

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
pickling lime we're going to use 1/4 cup

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.990 
pickling lime we're going to use 1/4 cup
in<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.940> gallon<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.330> water<00:05:02.800> now<00:05:03.800> as<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:04.940> said

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
in a gallon of water now as I said

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.450 
in a gallon of water now as I said
hydrated<00:05:05.690> lime<00:05:05.840> and/or<00:05:06.680> pickling<00:05:07.039> lime<00:05:07.160> is

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
hydrated lime and/or pickling lime is

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.480 
hydrated lime and/or pickling lime is
caustic<00:05:08.060> okay<00:05:08.539> so<00:05:09.470> gloves<00:05:09.740> are<00:05:09.950> probably<00:05:10.310> in

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
caustic okay so gloves are probably in

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.510 
caustic okay so gloves are probably in
order<00:05:10.639> but<00:05:11.360> I'm<00:05:11.720> not<00:05:11.990> using<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.590> wouldn't<00:05:13.400> want

order but I'm not using I wouldn't want

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.120 
order but I'm not using I wouldn't want
to<00:05:13.610> do<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:13.850> on<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> windy<00:05:14.330> day<00:05:14.360> outdoors<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.860> I

my water reservoir now one of the things
that<00:05:44.599> I'm<00:05:44.689> going<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:44.900> make<00:05:45.020> sure<00:05:45.319> is<00:05:46.039> that<00:05:46.129> it's

that I'm going to make sure is that it's
at<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.639> end<00:05:46.879> of<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.180> day<00:05:47.419> when<00:05:48.319> my<00:05:48.500> plants

that<00:05:51.289> I've<00:05:51.409> tipped<00:05:51.680> my<00:05:51.919> box<00:05:52.189> to<00:05:52.939> make<00:05:53.090> sure

in<00:05:55.490> my<00:05:55.550> water<00:05:55.819> reservoir<00:05:56.599> now<00:05:57.199> we've<00:05:57.439> already

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
in my water reservoir now we've already

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.409 
in my water reservoir now we've already
done<00:05:58.009> that<00:05:58.039> so<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.490> know<00:05:58.580> this<00:05:58.759> is<00:05:58.939> going<00:05:59.120> to<00:05:59.210> fit

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
done that so I know this is going to fit

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.390 
done that so I know this is going to fit
and<00:06:00.139> this<00:06:00.319> is<00:06:00.469> going<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:00.680> go<00:06:00.740> into<00:06:00.919> solution

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
and this is going to go into solution

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.700 
and this is going to go into solution
rather<00:06:01.580> easy<00:06:02.020> I'm<00:06:03.020> going<00:06:03.139> to<00:06:03.199> mix<00:06:03.379> it<00:06:03.530> up<00:06:03.650> just

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
rather easy I'm going to mix it up just

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.219 
rather easy I'm going to mix it up just
a<00:06:03.949> little<00:06:03.979> bit<00:06:04.310> and<00:06:05.090> then<00:06:05.270> Frankham<00:06:05.690> go<00:06:05.810> let

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
a little bit and then Frankham go let

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.749 
a little bit and then Frankham go let
you<00:06:06.379> pour<00:06:06.680> that<00:06:06.710> into<00:06:07.039> the<00:06:07.190> reservoir<00:06:07.580> if<00:06:07.669> you

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
you pour that into the reservoir if you

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.740 
you pour that into the reservoir if you
don't<00:06:07.909> mind<00:06:08.120> No

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
don't mind No

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.510 
don't mind No
now<00:06:09.229> that's<00:06:09.440> going<00:06:09.560> to<00:06:09.620> look<00:06:09.800> like<00:06:09.919> a<00:06:09.979> milky

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
now that's going to look like a milky

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:23.320 
now that's going to look like a milky
white<00:06:11.379> substance<00:06:21.729> okay<00:06:22.729> well<00:06:23.090> is<00:06:23.240> there

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
white substance okay well is there

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.730 
white substance okay well is there
anything<00:06:23.509> else<00:06:23.690> that<00:06:23.810> I<00:06:23.930> need<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.229> do<00:06:24.379> no

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
anything else that I need to do no

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.490 
anything else that I need to do no
that's<00:06:25.009> pretty<00:06:25.190> much<00:06:25.400> it<00:06:25.639> so<00:06:26.180> how<00:06:26.810> long<00:06:27.080> before

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
that's pretty much it so how long before

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.839 
that's pretty much it so how long before
I'll<00:06:27.740> see<00:06:27.919> this<00:06:28.069> problem<00:06:28.340> go<00:06:28.610> away

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
I'll see this problem go away

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.600 
I'll see this problem go away

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
just be a random pick off and it

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.950 
just be a random pick off and it
wouldn't<00:06:45.020> be<00:06:45.139> very<00:06:45.319> much<00:06:45.560> okay<00:06:46.129> and<00:06:46.810> are<00:06:47.810> there
