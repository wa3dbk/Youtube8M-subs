something that it's not a dagger for a
change<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.089> know<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> love<00:00:42.600> the

motorsport chronographs

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.329 
motorsport chronographs
and<00:00:45.600> they're<00:00:45.750> limited<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:48.379> 1970<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> the

and they're limited just to 1970 and the

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.099 
and they're limited just to 1970 and the
rationale<00:00:50.789> from<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.179> is<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:51.870> first

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
rationale from that is when they first

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.930 
rationale from that is when they first
released<00:00:52.589> the<00:00:52.769> original<00:00:52.859> crew<00:00:53.339> Norris<00:00:53.699> back

in 1970 mmm-hmm and that association

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
in 1970 mmm-hmm and that association
with<00:00:57.059> Formula<00:00:57.629> One<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> golden<00:00:58.739> period

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
numbered from 1 to 1970 what are some of

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.370 
numbered from 1 to 1970 what are some of
the<00:01:05.040> technicals<00:01:05.489> water<00:01:05.730> for<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.060> watch<00:01:06.270> ok

they've<00:01:07.649> increased<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> case<00:01:08.369> size<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
they've increased the case size from the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.149 
they've increased the case size from the
older<00:01:09.329> original<00:01:09.840> Chronos<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:10.979> gone<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
older original Chronos and it's gone to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
older original Chronos and it's gone to
forty<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.670> point<00:01:11.909> five<00:01:12.090> millimeters<00:01:12.659> that's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
forty two point five millimeters that's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.310 
forty two point five millimeters that's
up<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:13.860> 40<00:01:14.509> millimeters<00:01:15.509> obviously<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.290> just

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
up from 40 millimeters obviously it just

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340 
up from 40 millimeters obviously it just
reminds<00:01:17.100> me<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> old<00:01:18.899> watches<00:01:19.290> from

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
reminds me of the the old watches from

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
reminds me of the the old watches from
the<00:01:19.500> seventies<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.869> what<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the seventies which have that what you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.060 
the seventies which have that what you
might<00:01:22.229> describe<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.219> a<00:01:23.250> crucian<00:01:23.700> shape<00:01:23.939> case

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
might describe is a crucian shape case

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.850 
might describe is a crucian shape case
just<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> nice<00:01:26.369> piece<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> nostalgia<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.860> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
only a 50 meter water resistance instead

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
only a 50 meter water resistance instead
of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> 100<00:01:35.039> meters<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> limit<00:01:36.299> are

to 7 7 5 4 ETA with the GMT module it is
a<00:01:47.759> fabulous<00:01:48.090> moment<00:01:48.420> they've<00:01:48.930> required<00:01:49.289> extra

powder to run this watch and that's why
they've<00:01:51.840> put<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.500> yeah<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:53.670> was

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
they've put that one in yeah there was

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
they've put that one in yeah there was
early<00:01:54.299> speculation<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.229> talk<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
early speculation and talk and I was a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.789 
early speculation and talk and I was a
little<00:01:56.340> concerned<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.960> dal<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> going

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
little concerned that the dal is going

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
little concerned that the dal is going
to<00:01:58.859> be<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.130> complicated<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.210> from<00:02:00.420> my

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
to be a little complicated but from my

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.469 
to be a little complicated but from my
point<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.929> view<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.439> think<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:03.000> superbly

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
point of view I think it's it's superbly

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.289 
point of view I think it's it's superbly
balanced<00:02:04.159> there<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.429> lot<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> information

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
balanced there is a lot of information

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.490 
balanced there is a lot of information
on<00:02:06.929> this<00:02:07.170> dial<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.450> people<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:10.140> said

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
on this dial a lot of people have said

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770 
on this dial a lot of people have said
that<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:11.040> it's<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> busy<00:02:11.640> dial<00:02:11.880> one<00:02:12.720> of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
that they think it's a busy dial one of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.180 
that they think it's a busy dial one of
the<00:02:12.840> time<00:02:12.990> your<00:02:13.110> wrist<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.710> believe<00:02:13.950> it

the time your wrist I don't believe it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.940 
the time your wrist I don't believe it
looks<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.430> way<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.050> kind<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.530> tends<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
looks that way it all kind of tends to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.380 
looks that way it all kind of tends to
blend<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> little<00:02:17.700> bit<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.180> course

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
blend in a little bit but of course

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.350 
blend in a little bit but of course
you've<00:02:18.600> got<00:02:18.630> your<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.500> Kemah<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.860> scale<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.460> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you've got your to Kemah to scale on the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.650 
you've got your to Kemah to scale on the
uppermost<00:02:21.720> part<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> bezel<00:02:23.300> next<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.420> from

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
uppermost part of the bezel next in from

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.300 
uppermost part of the bezel next in from
that<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.350> 24<00:02:26.040> hour<00:02:26.190> scale<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:26.880> GMT<00:02:28.310> but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that is your 24 hour scale for GMT but

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.310 
that is your 24 hour scale for GMT but
they<00:02:29.490> sit<00:02:29.880> quite<00:02:30.150> nicely<00:02:30.420> together<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.260> I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
they sit quite nicely together and I

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.010 
they sit quite nicely together and I
like<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.770> way<00:02:31.920> particularly<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.270> GMT

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
like the way particularly with the GMT

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.350 
like the way particularly with the GMT
scale<00:02:34.560> they'll<00:02:35.250> split<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:35.760> into<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
scale they'll split it up into like a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.900 
scale they'll split it up into like a
daylight<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.230> night<00:02:37.440> time<00:02:37.710> effect<00:02:38.700> you've

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
daylight and a night time effect you've

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.020 
daylight and a night time effect you've
got<00:02:39.150> your<00:02:39.870> darker<00:02:40.230> British<00:02:41.100> racing<00:02:41.310> green<00:02:41.490> on

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
got your darker British racing green on

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
got your darker British racing green on
this<00:02:42.240> side<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.260> white<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.770> side<00:02:44.010> and

this side and the white on this side and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.150 
this side and the white on this side and
I<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:45.240> it's<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> nice<00:02:45.600> touch<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.740> they<00:02:46.950> come

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
I think it's a nice touch and they come

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.320 
I think it's a nice touch and they come

extra<00:03:10.950> feature<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.490> I've<00:03:11.640> included<00:03:12.140> in

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
extra feature that I've included in

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.660 
extra feature that I've included in
warrants<00:03:13.620> bonus<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.250> ten<00:03:14.430> minute

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
warrants bonus is the ten minute

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.220 
warrants bonus is the ten minute
countdown<00:03:14.940> how<00:03:15.270> did<00:03:15.420> they<00:03:15.510> sneak<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.020> in

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.560 
countdown how did they sneak that in
there<00:03:16.410> Lauren<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:16.890> think<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.360> quite

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
there Lauren I think it's really quite

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.410 
there Lauren I think it's really quite
smart<00:03:19.080> though<00:03:19.350> they've<00:03:19.709> effectively<00:03:20.220> put<00:03:21.120> one

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
smart though they've effectively put one

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.510 
smart though they've effectively put one
more<00:03:21.660> complication<00:03:22.050> into<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> watch<00:03:22.860> without

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
more complication into the watch without

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.479 
more complication into the watch without
actually<00:03:24.090> needing<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:25.110> add<00:03:25.860> any<00:03:26.370> extra

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
actually needing to add any extra

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.340 
actually needing to add any extra
complication<00:03:27.390> into<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> movement<00:03:28.110> all

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
complication into the movement all

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.699 
complication into the movement all
they've<00:03:28.620> done<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:29.840> they've<00:03:30.840> extended<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
they've done is they've extended the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.440 
they've done is they've extended the
bottom<00:03:31.980> part<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> hand<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.209> minute

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
bottom part of the hand in your minute

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.530 
bottom part of the hand in your minute
counter<00:03:33.840> downwards<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.970> put<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> 10<00:03:36.270> minute

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
counter downwards and put a 10 minute

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.229 
counter downwards and put a 10 minute
scaler<00:03:36.840> corresponds<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:39.120> can

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
scaler corresponds to it so you can

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.300 
scaler corresponds to it so you can
count<00:03:39.480> down<00:03:39.690> from<00:03:39.930> 10<00:03:40.170> minutes<00:03:40.350> there's<00:03:41.220> a

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
count down from 10 minutes there's a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.610 
count down from 10 minutes there's a
slight<00:03:41.550> variation<00:03:41.910> on<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:43.080> original

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
slight variation on the original

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.979 
slight variation on the original

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
photograph work that are is released on

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.710 
photograph work that are is released on
that<00:03:46.140> 10<00:03:46.410> minute<00:03:46.620> counter<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.300> pointer

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that 10 minute counter that that pointer

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.509 
that 10 minute counter that that pointer
isn't<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.140> full-length<00:03:49.560> green<00:03:49.950> pointer<00:03:50.370> it's

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
isn't a full-length green pointer it's

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.400 
isn't a full-length green pointer it's
only<00:03:50.700> important<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.480> only<00:03:51.690> green<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
only important it's only green on the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.190 
only important it's only green on the
tip<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:53.239> think<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.360> fits<00:03:54.570> quite<00:03:54.720> well<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.080> your

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
tip I think that fits quite well on your

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.900 
tip I think that fits quite well on your
wrists<00:03:55.440> were<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.830> there<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.430> doesn't<00:03:56.760> suit

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
wrists were on there and it doesn't suit

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.270 
wrists were on there and it doesn't suit
to<00:03:57.120> oil<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.660> prayer<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.260> don't<00:03:58.739> think<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.100> it

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to oil to prayer I don't think so it

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.060 
to oil to prayer I don't think so it
certainly<00:03:59.580> doesn't<00:03:59.760> sit<00:04:00.000> any<00:04:00.150> higher<00:04:00.360> than<00:04:00.630> my

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
certainly doesn't sit any higher than my

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.840 
certainly doesn't sit any higher than my
than<00:04:02.070> my<00:04:02.450> Williams<00:04:03.450> team<00:04:03.690> cronograph<00:04:04.850> even

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
than my Williams team cronograph even

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.070 
than my Williams team cronograph even
the<00:04:05.940> fact<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> slightly<00:04:06.780> smaller

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
the fact that it is a slightly smaller

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.850 
the fact that it is a slightly smaller
case<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.739> think<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.790> wears<00:04:09.480> quite<00:04:10.290> nicely<00:04:10.530> on

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
case I think it wears quite nicely on

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.280 
case I think it wears quite nicely on
the<00:04:11.010> wrist<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.550> smaller<00:04:11.940> watch<00:04:12.209> but<00:04:12.570> you

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
the wrist it is a smaller watch but you

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.960 
the wrist it is a smaller watch but you
know<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.680> red<00:04:13.830> rotor<00:04:14.100> has<00:04:14.430> in
