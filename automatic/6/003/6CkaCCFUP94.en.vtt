Silver Wolf invasion and yeah so the
weapons<00:00:21.779> tech<00:00:22.020> costs<00:00:22.410> 79<00:00:22.890> nano<00:00:23.130> pods<00:00:23.460> as

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
weapons tech costs 79 nano pods as

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
weapons tech costs 79 nano pods as
expected<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:26.000> with<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:27.480> used<00:00:27.720> by<00:00:27.840> itself

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
expected and with it when used by itself

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.790 
expected and with it when used by itself
it<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.490> powerful<00:00:29.760> unit<00:00:30.619> but<00:00:31.619> when

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
it is not a very powerful unit but when

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.560 
it is not a very powerful unit but when
it<00:00:31.949> used<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> combination<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.360> other

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it used in a combination with other

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.220 
it used in a combination with other
units<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:37.020> deal

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
units this one and this one can deal

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
units this one and this one can deal
damage<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.100> weapon<00:00:38.250> tech<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> basically

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
damage so the weapon tech is basically

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
damage so the weapon tech is basically
helper<00:00:39.780> unit<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> unit<00:00:41.579> by

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
helper unit it's not like a unit by

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.709 
helper unit it's not like a unit by
itself<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:43.040> normally<00:00:44.040> these<00:00:44.370> guys<00:00:44.660> sorry

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
itself so normally these guys sorry

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.119 
itself so normally these guys sorry
these<00:00:45.960> guys<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.289> higher<00:00:46.500> resistance<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
these guys have higher resistance the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.850 
these guys have higher resistance the
crushing<00:00:47.520> damage<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.170> were<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.559> hit<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
crushing damage now if I were to hit it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.529 
crushing damage now if I were to hit it
hit<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.610> shatter<00:00:50.940> shot<00:00:51.270> right

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
hit them with this shatter shot right

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.319 
hit them with this shatter shot right
here<00:00:51.750> we've<00:00:52.379> got<00:00:52.530> our<00:00:52.590> amp<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:53.070> sorry<00:00:55.039> then

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
here we've got our amp I'm sorry then

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.750 
here we've got our amp I'm sorry then
they<00:00:57.329> take<00:00:57.629> significantly<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:59.340> crushing

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
they take significantly more crushing

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.500 
they take significantly more crushing
damage<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.289> right<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:02.510> same

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
damage as you can see right there same

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530 
damage as you can see right there same
goes<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.110> explosive<00:01:04.739> amp<00:01:05.010> except<00:01:05.580> well

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
goes for the explosive amp except well

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.920 
goes for the explosive amp except well
that<00:01:06.780> works<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.260> explosive<00:01:07.950> damage

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.070 

so<00:01:14.410> there<00:01:15.410> there<00:01:15.830> goes<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.540> Dexter<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.810> this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
so there there goes the Dexter so this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.320 
so there there goes the Dexter so this
unit<00:01:21.260> can<00:01:21.500> make<00:01:21.740> battles<00:01:22.100> like<00:01:22.880> seem

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
unit can make battles like seem

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.380 
unit can make battles like seem
extremely<00:01:23.960> easy<00:01:24.350> just<00:01:24.920> because<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:26.270> it

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
extremely easy just because of what it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.390 
extremely easy just because of what it
does

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
does

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.440 
does
I've<00:01:28.400> been<00:01:28.670> using<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.120> for<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.360> bit<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:31.450> it

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
I've been using it for a bit and it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.270 
I've been using it for a bit and it
definitely<00:01:33.050> can<00:01:33.290> be<00:01:33.320> useful<00:01:33.890> in<00:01:34.070> certain

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
definitely can be useful in certain

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.690 
definitely can be useful in certain
situations<00:01:35.740> like<00:01:36.740> see<00:01:36.980> there<00:01:37.250> goes<00:01:37.460> all<00:01:37.670> of

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
situations like see there goes all of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.160 
situations like see there goes all of
its<00:01:37.940> health<00:01:38.120> nearly<00:01:38.660> all<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.810> its<00:01:39.020> health

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
its health nearly all of its health

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:49.260 
its health nearly all of its health
within<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.860> shot<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:41.290> yeah<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:48.470> unit<00:01:48.890> I

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
within one shot and yeah so this unit I

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.630 
within one shot and yeah so this unit I
think<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.360> was<00:01:50.479> worth<00:01:50.720> getting<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:51.860> there<00:01:52.160> but

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
think it was worth getting but there but

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.820 
think it was worth getting but there but
for<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.540> guys<00:01:53.720> who<00:01:53.930> were<00:01:54.260> expecting

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
work on the ancient Sentinel so it will

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.490 
work on the ancient Sentinel so it will
not<00:01:59.630> be<00:01:59.690> one<00:02:00.080> shot

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500
