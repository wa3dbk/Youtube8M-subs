00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.170
 to a rose like ponds or cousin sun 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.420
 and good front very well in this 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.310
 Sometimes I have another destination video 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.869
 but guys today is Friday like this 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.540
 I hope you have a nice weekend 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.850
 week remember that Friday is the 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.440
 most important day in destination and since 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.900
 it comes to the south in the people the 9 the 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.190
 character that brings us exotic things and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.810
 good to this day is the 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.850
 right side in what is the hangar of 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.470
 the tower this character remember that 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.720
 arrive on Friday at 3 in the morning 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.370
 and you see on Sunday at 3 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.710
 I'm today is that 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.120
 this corner is going down the stairs 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.550
 let's give a little review to what 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.100
 which are the exotic things that the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.280
 today and the curiosities and good 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.440
 let's start with the titan's bib 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.989
 which is very unique I think the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.690
 most important of the titan has light 21 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.750
 discipline 104 is worth 13 strange coins 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.969
 it's called the mentary weapon and it's good 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.009
 small allows you to bring more bullets to 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.120
 special weapons and for heavy weapons 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.920
 also lets you you can bring a 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.130
 additional grenade which is very 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.430
 important for this titan and well let's go 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.920
 to go through now with the character that 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.830
 is the good hunter let's look at his 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.350
 helmet which is somewhat repetitive already 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.360
 that they have put it three times that I know 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.560
 so well I do not know how many times it takes 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.950
 already has light 21 and 187 and they have coins 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.170
 strange 13 ok good worth 13 good good 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.090
 you miss this helmet is already very 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.600
 repetitive is very shocked but the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.820
 things that it lets you have is that when you 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.590
 you use your golden weapon what is the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.840
 good gunman gives you a shot 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.840
 additional for each time you use it 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.640
 which is pretty good for this so 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.070
 He is the hunter because it's good that way 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.250
 you bring the gunslinger not to say so and 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.430
 good you if 0 has more light 21 strength 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.530
 over 82 and have a good worth 3 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.840
 strange and it's called light beyond 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.510
 nemesis this helmet is very chunky that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.150
 allows you to revive faster 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.010
 allies cross or that your allies are 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.180
 revive a little faster to you and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.670
 it also allows you 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.890
 you can throw orbs for your 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.500
 friends have their last use faster to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.849
 part that also allows you to have 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.189
 melee attacks or much more 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.510
 ok fast and the helmet for the truth is 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.189
 very young I think it's the best that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 there is to see if 0 so I recommend them 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.889
 that others buy it are plus things 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.829
 now we go with the weapon which is called 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.280
 to truth what is called like that and is a 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.849
 of the weapons that best serve in what 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 is the game of destiny and good this weapon 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 lets you load two bullets worth 17 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.919
 strange coins and good to be mate 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.590
 allows then when they launch the rockets 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.450
 that sometimes they put before or after 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.489
 very well also allows you to 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.510
 when he throws a rocket at some 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.030
 So, the person is following that 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.489
 white you chose and well 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.250
 some way you will reach backward sometimes 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.439
 and it kills what the character is 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.269
 pretty good apart that leaves you 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.120
 recharge a little faster and several 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.060
 tides plus that the weapon has not but I 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.440
 I think it's one of the weapons that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.870
 they will serve you here in this game 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.970
 apart we have the most 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.660
 exceptional this differentiates 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.459
 others are worth 23 notes of light so 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.160
 well you know that this allows you to see 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.890
 give you a fish tank for what is the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.260
 sorcerer or the hunter or the titan ok 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.970
 Now we have what curiosities 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.819
 are telemetries for rifles 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.790
 automatic for what the rifles are 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.700
 of pulse now in this case we have 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.680
 explorer rifles which gives you one 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.140
 for a good one you get 5 for a coin 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.850
 strange and good this what allows you 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.709
 is that you can accelerate your weapon 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.930
 for half an hour in a way 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.120
 incredible to obviously evolve the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.120
 now we have what are the improvements of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.830
 vehicle and one is emerald color and the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.130
 another is red color is what allows you 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.440
 is changing the hue of the fire of 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.090
 your hummingbird apart that gives you a little more 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.359
 of speed and a little more than 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.940
 resistance and finally we have what 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.910
 are 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.750
 without hips for refills for 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.760
 heavy weapons give you five one per 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.300
 a strange coin which is quite 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.830
 well also 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.920
 well when I recommend you buy it 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.280
 but if you like to buy exotic things 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.110
 Well then I recommend you keep this 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.790
 not so good so I hope that you 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.290
 have liked this little revised of 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.460
 things discover the people of the 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.350
 nine I hope you liked it 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.970
 remember to give a pinche like I think 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.140
 which is a social network and to the channel for 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.610
 more videos if you have any questions 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.500
 regarding what are the things that 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.940
 I'll finish what I teach you 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.530
