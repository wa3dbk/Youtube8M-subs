00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 take place back in 2008 but first 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.940
 prevented the trauma of Alexander Povetkin 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.740
 then some boxers 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
 years could not agree on where and on 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.389
 what conditions will be spent from here and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.969
 rush of interest to the upcoming bout 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.529
 in Moscow, Vladimir gendlin who will 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.240
 comment this fight on our first 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.250
 The channel claims that for 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 klitschko junior despite all his 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 advantages and in height and weight this fight with 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 it will not be easy 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.599
 when they go out in the ring, everyone knows 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 that we will be a little boring 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.120
 clearly 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 everything will be predetermined 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 today surely this will not happen 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.800
 because I have to retreat now 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.059
 nowhere 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 he will have to break the hegemony of the nickname 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.420
 or roll back 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.670
 I do not know in the second Shelon 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 professional boxing but came 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.879
 for the first time in Moscow specifically for this fight 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.800
 multiple world champion among 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.049
 Lenox Lewis professionals once 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.170
 victorious and famous Tayson jersey and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.310
 older brother of Wladimir Klitschko Vitali 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 believes that everything will depend on 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.490
 how many rounds will the fight last 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 Grishin Vladimir Klitschko is very strong and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.680
 quickly he has long arms and he is very 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 big but it might turn out 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.270
 disadvantage if the battle is short then 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.970
 Povetkin can win if the fight 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 will last long vladimir will win 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.200
 Povetkin professionals call 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.780
 aggressive technical but rectilinear 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 boxer klitschko very calculating with 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.480
 good jab that is short 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 oncoming straight 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.900
 and even Vladimir Klitschko loves to box 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.820
 at a distance the benefit of his hand 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.260
 really longer than most 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.010
 whether his rival will be able to overcome Sasha 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.240
 Here are these 10 centimeters distance from 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.060
 left fist 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.450
 come closer here then he will 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.490
 master position will not be able then 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.620
 of course my turning sugar thick 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 it remains to add that it will be a battle not 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.400
 only professional boxers but also 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.210
 two Olympic champions Vladimir 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.460
 Klitschko won 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.690
 Olympiad back in ninety-six 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.670
 year in atlanta 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
 the day before the fight and his team in 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.030
 headed with the older brother checked the ring in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.190
