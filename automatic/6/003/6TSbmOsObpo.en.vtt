00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.590 
tidings this is the first time i've been
on<00:02:47.770> Maui<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.550> hiding<00:02:48.970> here<00:02:49.210> but<00:02:49.450> we've<00:02:49.570> been

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
on Maui and hiding here but we've been

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.870 
on Maui and hiding here but we've been
surfing<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.350> pretty<00:02:50.590> much<00:02:50.770> every<00:02:51.070> day<00:02:51.220> so

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
surfing it pretty much every day so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.440 
surfing it pretty much every day so
China<00:02:52.660> learning<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.740> wave<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.910> past<00:02:55.210> week

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
China learning the wave this past week

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.040 
China learning the wave this past week
and<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:57.100> definitely<00:02:57.370> helped<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.480> at<00:02:58.810> home

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
and that definitely helped and at home

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.290 
and that definitely helped and at home
our<00:02:59.470> spots<00:02:59.860> are<00:03:00.010> pretty<00:03:00.310> similar<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.060> on

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
our spots are pretty similar to this on

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.460 
our spots are pretty similar to this on
Oahu<00:03:01.710> so<00:03:02.710> I<00:03:03.330> guess<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.360> was<00:03:04.720> enough<00:03:04.990> training

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
Oahu so I guess that was enough training

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.950 
Oahu so I guess that was enough training
for<00:03:05.590> me
