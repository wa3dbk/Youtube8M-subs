00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.710
 make a meatball show these are 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.829
 the ingredients 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.630
 for our recipe we need chile de 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.170
 egg tree 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.000
 baguette 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.930
 tomato puree tomato real 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.330
 oregano 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.330
 bread ground cheese 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.460
 and ground beef from the branch 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.890
 very well let's start with our 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 meat 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 let's add our bread crumb 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 chopped chile 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920
 egg 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.250
 and salt and pepper as we have everything 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.010
 we stir with our hand 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.010
 to incorporate all the ingredients well 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.210
 and to finish we form our 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.210
 meatballs 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.840
 you have to make some meatballs not very 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.869
 big 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 more or less than an inch by which 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.640
 can fit in the bread 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.329
 we already have here our meatballs what 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.909
 we are going to winnow the coal and we are going to 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:43.890
 You are turning every 23 minutes 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.770
 so that all sides are seeing 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 Now appropriations has to take around 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.380
 between 10 and 15 minutes to have them already 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.380
 well cooked 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.230
 Now let's make the sauce for 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.810
 our sandwich or are the tomatoes that 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.050
 We put in the grill for a while like that 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.429
 the skin will not rise, it will not cut 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.400
 nothing more here 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:19.189
 it's technology and I'm not going to draw you 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.230
 so they do not occupy being very pretty or anything 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.290
 since if the media crushed then what 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.049
 we add humor 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.640
 and this they do with all the tomatoes already 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.640
 that we have the tomato in the bowl 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.390
 let's add the tomato puree 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.560
 we are going to put oregano 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.380
 and pepper 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.160
 we are going to stir everything very well 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.160
 very well 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.050
 and we have our sauce ready 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.740
 our meatballs came out here 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.870
 now let's put our saber together 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.700
 good since they took the rings out of the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.120
 grill you can go on a cruise 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.950
 I know 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.250
 is to earn a lot of money nobody does 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.250
 with rings 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.629
 and we're going to make the cut above something 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.310
 that is not the most traditional but it is 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.920
 cool because it helps us keep 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 meatballs 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.760
 in a better position the truth will be 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.290
 less complicated to eat the sandwich 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.790
 of the eyes 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.500
 and good 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.500
 let's put some cheese 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.070
 we are placing the meatballs 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.190
 more than that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.720
 more meatballs 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.349
 and now we take the bobsleigh team 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.349
 from italy on the grill 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.620
 I do not know 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.160
 ah 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.230
 since we have gratin the sandwich 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.230

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.550
