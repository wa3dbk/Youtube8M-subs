-<00:02:34.590> right<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.130> hopefully<00:02:37.050> here<00:02:38.050> we<00:02:38.230> are<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.709> can't

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
- right so hopefully here we are I can't

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.400 
- right so hopefully here we are I can't
see<00:02:39.370> what's<00:02:39.640> happening<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.450> screen<00:02:40.930> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
see what's happening on the screen and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.880 
see what's happening on the screen and
you<00:02:41.739> won't<00:02:41.950> actually<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.580> me<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.140> I'm<00:02:44.500> told

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you won't actually see me so I'm told

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.610 
you won't actually see me so I'm told
that<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.459> have<00:02:45.790> three<00:02:46.540> ounces<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.830> rice<00:02:48.790> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
that you have three ounces of rice and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.380 
that you have three ounces of rice and
this<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.800> where<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.220> went<00:02:51.340> wrong<00:02:51.670> last<00:02:51.970> time

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
this is where it went wrong last time

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.809 
this is where it went wrong last time
because<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:53.050> assume<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:54.010> tablespoon

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
because I assume that the tablespoon

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.020 
because I assume that the tablespoon
would<00:02:55.120> be<00:02:55.330> an<00:02:55.450> ounce<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:56.019> something<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.700> put

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
would be an ounce of something and I put

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.199 
would be an ounce of something and I put
three<00:02:58.450> heaped<00:02:58.840> tablespoon<00:02:59.830> fills<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.519> now<00:03:00.819> so

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
three heaped tablespoon fills in now so

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.080 
three heaped tablespoon fills in now so
now<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.800> assume<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.550> have<00:03:03.760> little

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
now I assume that you have little

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.080 
now I assume that you have little
tablespoon<00:03:04.810> full<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.540> hing<00:03:08.110> goes<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:09.730> goes

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
tablespoon full and so hing goes in goes

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.810 
tablespoon full and so hing goes in goes
the<00:03:10.150> rice<00:03:12.900> what<00:03:13.900> did<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.380> say<00:03:14.620> two<00:03:15.160> ounces<00:03:15.760> of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
the rice what did it say two ounces of

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.729 
the rice what did it say two ounces of
sugar<00:03:16.829> right<00:03:17.890> well<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:19.360> isn't<00:03:19.600> too<00:03:19.989> critical

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
sugar right well that isn't too critical

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.120 
sugar right well that isn't too critical
so<00:03:21.040> we'll<00:03:21.280> have<00:03:21.579> two<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.750> those<00:03:23.130> two

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
so we'll have two of those two

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.400 
so we'll have two of those two
tablespoons<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.299> sugar<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.769> doesn't<00:03:27.190> matter

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
tablespoons of sugar it doesn't matter

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:46.440 
tablespoons of sugar it doesn't matter
because<00:03:42.329> butter<00:03:43.890> goodness<00:03:44.920> enough<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.180> butter

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
because butter goodness enough of butter

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.270 
because butter goodness enough of butter
and<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.780> haven't<00:03:47.049> got<00:03:47.230> any<00:03:47.440> but<00:03:47.709> there<00:03:47.890> anyway

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
and I haven't got any but there anyway

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.729 
and I haven't got any but there anyway
but<00:03:48.579> I've<00:03:48.730> got<00:03:48.970> some<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.709> stuff<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:52.739> what

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
but I've got some of this stuff so what

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.140 
but I've got some of this stuff so what
do<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.920> reckon<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.720> think<00:03:55.720> that's<00:03:55.989> about<00:03:56.230> right

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
do you reckon I think that's about right

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.479 
do you reckon I think that's about right
and<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:59.489> we've<00:04:00.489> prepared<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.769> now<00:04:02.769> he<00:04:03.310> will

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
and so we've prepared it and now he will

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.960 
and so we've prepared it and now he will
have<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.910> go<00:04:04.090> into<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.660> oven<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.640> we'll<00:04:06.640> leave

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
have to go into the oven so we'll leave

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.490 
have to go into the oven so we'll leave
the<00:04:07.630> recording<00:04:08.320> until<00:04:08.530> stage<00:04:09.130> three<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.500> see

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
the recording until stage three and see

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.580
