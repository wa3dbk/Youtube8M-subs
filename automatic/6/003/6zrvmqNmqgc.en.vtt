alright<00:00:02.790> so<00:00:03.030> did<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.210> get<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:03.570> solder<00:00:03.899> out

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
alright so did I get that solder out

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
alright so did I get that solder out
what<00:00:04.350> I'm<00:00:04.440> gonna<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:04.950> uh<00:00:06.680> throw<00:00:07.680> some<00:00:07.859> flux

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
what I'm gonna do is uh throw some flux

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.430 
what I'm gonna do is uh throw some flux
down<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> use<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> mg<00:00:09.389> chemicals<00:00:09.929> no<00:00:10.170> clean<00:00:10.410> flux

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
down I use a mg chemicals no clean flux

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.010 
down I use a mg chemicals no clean flux
paste<00:00:11.070> put<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.969> down<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:13.160> use<00:00:14.160> some<00:00:15.020> some

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
paste put that down and use some some

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.170 
paste put that down and use some some
extra<00:00:16.320> solder<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.980> top<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.880> get<00:00:18.000> that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
extra solder on top of that to get that

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
extra solder on top of that to get that
other<00:00:18.300> stuff<00:00:18.600> hot<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.529> ball<00:00:19.740> dealers<00:00:20.039> I'll

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
other stuff hot this ball dealers I'll

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
other stuff hot this ball dealers I'll
throw<00:00:20.369> some<00:00:20.550> extra<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.260> get<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> hot<00:00:22.560> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
throw some extra on there get it hot and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.300 
throw some extra on there get it hot and
then<00:00:23.369> I'll<00:00:23.519> wake<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.689> copper<00:00:25.080> wick

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
then I'll wake it out some copper wick

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.480 
then I'll wake it out some copper wick
but<00:00:26.310> uh<00:00:26.810> that's<00:00:27.810> how<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.349> warmed<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
but uh that's how I get it warmed up and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:41.020 
but uh that's how I get it warmed up and
I<00:00:29.580> throw<00:00:29.849> some<00:00:30.090> extra<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.700> did<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.059> uh

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
I throw some extra so what I did is uh

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.600 
I throw some extra so what I did is uh
do<00:00:42.030> some<00:00:42.320> desoldering<00:00:43.320> LS<00:00:43.649> made<00:00:43.860> four<00:00:44.129> points

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
do some desoldering LS made four points

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
do some desoldering LS made four points
on<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> charging<00:00:45.239> port<00:00:46.399> took<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.760> vast

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
on the charging port took the vast

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.520 
on the charging port took the vast
majority<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> solder<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.410> when

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
majority in the solder out but then when

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.670 
majority in the solder out but then when
I<00:00:49.620> did<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> uh<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> heat<00:00:51.449> gun<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> masks

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
I did is uh he was a heat gun and masks

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.610 
I did is uh he was a heat gun and masks
everything<00:00:53.250> off<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.670> much<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
everything off pretty much with that

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.880 
everything off pretty much with that
with<00:00:55.620> aluminum<00:00:56.100> foil<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.379> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
with aluminum foil and I have this this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.150 
with aluminum foil and I have this this
heat<00:00:59.190> dissipation<00:00:59.730> pad<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:01.160> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
heat dissipation pad that I use that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.730 
heat dissipation pad that I use that
works<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:03.680> anyway<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:06.439> do<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> sign

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
works really well anyway so do you sign

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
works really well anyway so do you sign
it<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> most<00:01:08.460> point<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:11.930> after

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it up for the most point and then after

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.510 
it up for the most point and then after
that<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> use<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> heat<00:01:13.530> gun<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.920> remove<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> old

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that I use a heat gun it remove the old

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.020 
that I use a heat gun it remove the old
charging<00:01:15.060> point<00:01:15.330> board<00:01:17.509> now<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
charging point board now we're going to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
charging point board now we're going to
solder<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> new<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.780> about<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> got

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
solder this new one on about I got

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
solder this new one on about I got
everything<00:01:22.979> cleaned<00:01:23.400> did<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.270> I'll<00:01:24.420> show

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
everything cleaned did like I'll show

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.820 
everything cleaned did like I'll show
you<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> whole<00:01:25.080> process<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.619> cleaning

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you the whole process of cleaning

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.030 
you the whole process of cleaning
everything<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:27.390> too<00:01:27.420> tedious

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
everything up it's just way too tedious

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.880 
everything up it's just way too tedious
so<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.710> some<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
so what I'm gonna do now is some of the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.510 
so what I'm gonna do now is some of the
new<00:01:32.900> charging<00:01:33.900> port<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> there's<00:01:34.860> seven

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
new charging port in and there's seven

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
new charging port in and there's seven
of<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:35.790> little<00:01:36.090> pins<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> seven

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
of these little pins that go to seven

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
of these little pins that go to seven
different<00:01:37.259> contact<00:01:37.890> points<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.509> just

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
different contact points so I'm just

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.700 
different contact points so I'm just
going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> use<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> flux<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.380 

now<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> very<00:01:47.250> carefully<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.149> these

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
now I have to very carefully that these

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.280 
now I have to very carefully that these
seven<00:01:48.990> contact<00:01:49.619> points<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:51.020> what<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> did

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
seven contact points now what I did

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.649 
seven contact points now what I did
first<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.340> solder<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> four<00:01:54.149> million

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
first is solder on the four million

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
first is solder on the four million
points<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.409> through<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> board<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
points that go through the board on the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
points that go through the board on the
other<00:01:56.369> side<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:57.270> been<00:01:57.479> done<00:01:57.750> already<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
other side that's been done already so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.830 
other side that's been done already so
it's<00:01:59.280> firmly<00:01:59.520> put<00:01:59.850> into<00:02:00.030> place<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.509> soldered

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's firmly put into place and soldered

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.539 
it's firmly put into place and soldered
into<00:02:01.350> position<00:02:02.600> before<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.219> put<00:02:05.219> down<00:02:05.369> these

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
into position before I put down these

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.779 
into position before I put down these
little<00:02:05.729> seven<00:02:06.149> contact<00:02:06.750> points<00:02:07.580> about<00:02:08.580> Reed

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
little seven contact points about Reed

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.910 
little seven contact points about Reed
yeah

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
yeah

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.290 
yeah
and<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:14.130> pretty<00:02:15.130> much<00:02:15.220> what<00:02:16.060> you're<00:02:16.210> gonna

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and that pretty much what you're gonna

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.720 
and that pretty much what you're gonna
do<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.690> put<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:18.130> really<00:02:18.310> small<00:02:18.580> amount

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
do is just put a really small amount

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.030 
do is just put a really small amount
down<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.720> play<00:02:20.230> with<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.680> work<00:02:20.860> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
down and just play with it and work it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.970 
down and just play with it and work it
from<00:02:21.220> one<00:02:21.430> side<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> other<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> just

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
from one side to the other and just

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.490 
from one side to the other and just
trying<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.280> drop<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.550> little<00:02:24.910> bit<00:02:25.060> onto<00:02:25.630> each

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
trying to drop a little bit onto each

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.090 
trying to drop a little bit onto each
point<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:28.200> you'll<00:02:29.200> really<00:02:29.440> want<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.740> count<00:02:29.950> on

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
point and you'll really want to count on

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.770 
point and you'll really want to count on
the<00:02:30.190> flux<00:02:30.810> working<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:33.220> flip<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.240> solder<00:02:34.540> in

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the flux working to flip that solder in

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.150 
the flux working to flip that solder in
the<00:02:34.900> right<00:02:35.190> way<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:37.110> only<00:02:38.160> bonding

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the right way so that it's only bonding

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.840 
the right way so that it's only bonding
to<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.630> occasion<00:02:40.630> points<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.250> all

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
to the occasion points on that so all

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.170 
to the occasion points on that so all
right

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
right

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.610 
right
here<00:02:43.480> I'm<00:02:43.570> using<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.990> week<00:02:44.140> where<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.440> got<00:02:44.590> a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
here I'm using a week where I got a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.590 
here I'm using a week where I got a
little<00:02:44.770> bit<00:02:44.950> too<00:02:45.100> much<00:02:45.250> solder<00:02:45.490> on<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
little bit too much solder on just a

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.830 
little bit too much solder on just a
little<00:02:46.630> bit<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.440> off<00:02:51.390> got<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.480> little<00:02:52.720> bit

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
little bit of that off got a little bit

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.980 
little bit of that off got a little bit
too<00:02:52.960> much<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.440> control<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.930> pulled<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
too much you just control it pulled a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:08.030 
too much you just control it pulled a
little<00:02:56.230> bit<00:02:56.350> off<00:02:56.470> here<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.920> there

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 

so<00:03:08.549> let's<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.879> ahead<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.120> watch<00:03:09.239> les<00:03:09.540> rest<00:03:10.140> of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
so let's go ahead and watch les rest of

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.170 
so let's go ahead and watch les rest of
the<00:03:10.290> process<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:11.010> um<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.280> takes<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.909> lot

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the process but um it just takes a lot

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.020 
the process but um it just takes a lot
of<00:03:18.209> practice<00:03:18.659> with<00:03:18.689> soldering<00:03:19.610> if<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.909> it

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
of practice with soldering if you do it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
of practice with soldering if you do it
enough<00:03:21.239> building<00:03:21.540> stuff<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.989> here<00:03:22.680> I'm<00:03:22.799> using

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
enough building stuff out here I'm using

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.160 
enough building stuff out here I'm using
like<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> steel<00:03:23.579> spider<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:24.180> help<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:25.019> even

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
like a steel spider to help to even

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.940 
like a steel spider to help to even
physically<00:03:25.709> guide<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.099> solder<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:27.560> each<00:03:28.560> pin

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
physically guide the solder to each pin

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.399 
physically guide the solder to each pin
that's<00:03:29.670> even<00:03:30.090> order<00:03:30.299> those<00:03:30.420> off<00:03:30.659> of<00:03:30.810> Amazon

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
that's even order those off of Amazon

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.899 
that's even order those off of Amazon
just<00:03:31.530> look<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.890> steel<00:03:32.129> spudger<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.760> got<00:03:32.879> a

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
just look for a steel spudger it's got a

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.920 
just look for a steel spudger it's got a
really<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.450> fine<00:03:33.629> point<00:03:35.659> here's<00:03:36.659> a<00:03:36.690> couple

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
really really fine point here's a couple

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.660 
really really fine point here's a couple
of<00:03:37.049> them<00:03:37.170> one<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.349> used<00:03:37.590> for<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.250> general

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
of them one I used for this general

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.280 
of them one I used for this general
stuff<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.120> one<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.239> only<00:03:39.510> use<00:03:39.720> for<00:03:39.930> soldering

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
stuff and one I only use for soldering

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.599 
stuff and one I only use for soldering
and<00:03:40.470> I'm<00:03:40.530> very<00:03:40.650> careful<00:03:40.890> with<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.250> tip<00:03:41.459> I

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
and I'm very careful with the tip I

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.039 
and I'm very careful with the tip I
never<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.030> very<00:03:42.180> expensive<00:03:42.420> use<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> for

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
never it's very expensive use it for

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.860 
never it's very expensive use it for
other<00:03:43.230> things<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.769> handy<00:03:44.129> tool<00:03:44.250> but<00:03:44.720> keep<00:03:45.720> it

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
other things as a handy tool but keep it

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.809 
other things as a handy tool but keep it
a<00:03:45.900> tip<00:03:46.139> perfect<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.889> never<00:03:47.370> use<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.670> for

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
a tip perfect on it never use it for

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.990 
a tip perfect on it never use it for
anything<00:03:47.970> else<00:03:48.209> if<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.170> try<00:03:49.379> a<00:03:49.409> very<00:03:49.709> kit<00:03:50.000> so

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
anything else if you try a very kit so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.240 
anything else if you try a very kit so
she<00:03:51.599> put<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> nice<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.260> perfect<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:53.099> some

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
she put a nice and perfect like some

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.920 
she put a nice and perfect like some
points<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.849> can<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.389> there<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:54.540> steel

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
points you can get in there with steel

you physically get in there and pull it
around<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.209> now<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:03.739> put<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.799> in<00:04:04.889> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
around and now you put it in the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.680 
around and now you put it in the
position<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.760> want<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.299> that's<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.510> real

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
position that you want so that's a real

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.619 
position that you want so that's a real
handy<00:04:06.840> tool<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.500> spongers<00:04:08.280> also<00:04:08.629> maneuvering

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
handy tool so spongers also maneuvering

handy tool so spongers also maneuvering
parts<00:04:09.989> around<00:04:10.230> what's<00:04:10.739> really<00:04:11.040> well<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.310> that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
parts around what's really well for that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:25.780 
parts around what's really well for that
too

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.870 

if<00:04:26.790> things<00:04:27.000> aren't<00:04:27.210> flowing<00:04:27.540> just<00:04:27.810> right<00:04:28.880> go

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
if things aren't flowing just right go

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.730 
if things aren't flowing just right go
ahead<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.150> take<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> toothbrush<00:04:30.840> or<00:04:31.320> whatever

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
ahead and take a toothbrush or whatever

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.520 
ahead and take a toothbrush or whatever
you<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.850> get<00:04:33.210> some<00:04:33.390> denatured<00:04:33.840> alcohol<00:04:33.960> clean

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
you to get some denatured alcohol clean

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.250 
you to get some denatured alcohol clean
everything<00:04:34.950> off<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.480> puts<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.570> new<00:04:36.600> flux<00:04:37.050> paste

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
everything off and puts a new flux paste

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.950 
everything off and puts a new flux paste
down<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:38.310> start<00:04:38.670> soldering<00:04:38.880> over<00:04:39.360> again<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
down and start soldering over again the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.990 
down and start soldering over again the
things<00:04:40.170> start<00:04:40.380> getting<00:04:40.530> burnt<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.310> dirty<00:04:41.670> and

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
things start getting burnt and dirty and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.480 
things start getting burnt and dirty and
the<00:04:42.420> fluxes<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.680> solder<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.010> not<00:04:44.190> flowing

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
the fluxes and the solder is not flowing

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.970 
the fluxes and the solder is not flowing
right<00:04:45.110> just<00:04:46.110> because<00:04:46.260> things<00:04:46.380> are<00:04:46.560> dirty<00:04:46.770> so

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
right just because things are dirty so

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.100 
right just because things are dirty so
once<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.340> get<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.550> solder<00:04:47.790> down<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.930> got<00:04:49.080> a

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
once you get the solder down you got a

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.540 
once you get the solder down you got a
little<00:04:49.350> bit<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.530> work<00:04:49.650> done<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.100> but<00:04:50.430> it's
