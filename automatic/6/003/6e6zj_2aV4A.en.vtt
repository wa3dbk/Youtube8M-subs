don't<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> angle<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.600> too<00:01:27.780> hard<00:01:28.080> but

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
don't want the angle to be too hard but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.840 
don't want the angle to be too hard but
you<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.159> enough<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> where

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
you want it to be just enough to where

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.240 
you want it to be just enough to where
it<00:01:29.909> doesn't<00:01:30.030> switch<00:01:30.299> your<00:01:30.420> ball<00:01:30.570> hand<00:01:30.890> now

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it doesn't switch your ball hand now

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
it doesn't switch your ball hand now
now<00:01:32.850> that'll<00:01:33.150> move<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.420> saw<00:01:33.689> me<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
now that'll move you just saw me do is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
now that'll move you just saw me do is
the<00:01:34.409> zigzag<00:01:34.680> burst<00:01:35.250> now<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> do

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the zigzag burst now what you want to do

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
the zigzag burst now what you want to do
with<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> zigzag<00:01:36.900> burst<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.280> pretty

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
with the zigzag burst is it's pretty

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.030 
with the zigzag burst is it's pretty
much<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.110> ball<00:01:40.470> hand<00:01:40.740> burst

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
much the same as the off ball hand burst

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
much the same as the off ball hand burst
I<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.490> showed<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.930> um<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.770> as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I just showed you but um it's not as

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
I just showed you but um it's not as
effective<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.729> used<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.509> top<00:01:45.689> moving

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
effective it used to be the top moving

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.319 
effective it used to be the top moving
to<00:01:46.140> K<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> yours<00:01:46.740> passed<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.119> not

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
to K and yours passed but now it's not

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
to K and yours passed but now it's not
as<00:01:48.479> good<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.619> still<00:01:49.799> something<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
as good but it's still something that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
as good but it's still something that
you're<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> mix<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.810> off

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you're gonna want to mix in with the off

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.510 
you're gonna want to mix in with the off
ball<00:01:52.320> hand<00:01:52.530> bursts<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> do

ball hand bursts and what you want to do
is<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.509> time<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.259> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> opposite

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is this time it's kind of the opposite

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
is this time it's kind of the opposite
what<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> once<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.360> past

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
half court again you don't want to be

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370 
half court again you don't want to be
spreading<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> your<00:02:00.719> say<00:02:01.170> you're

you're gonna move the left stick up into

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.480 
you're gonna move the left stick up into
the<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.100> way<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.399> gonna

hold down RT this is gonna give you a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.380 
hold down RT this is gonna give you a
zigzag<00:02:10.890> burst<00:02:11.280> animation<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.239> you'll<00:02:12.390> see

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
zigzag burst animation which you'll see

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
zigzag burst animation which you'll see
now<00:02:13.780> you're<00:02:13.960> gonna<00:02:14.080> hold<00:02:14.290> down<00:02:14.380> LT<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.070> keep<00:02:15.280> it

now you're gonna hold down LT to keep it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.120 
now you're gonna hold down LT to keep it
in<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.730> new<00:02:15.910> ball<00:02:16.180> hand<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:17.770> I'm<00:02:17.890> going

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
to zag back in to the original side of

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.710 
to zag back in to the original side of
the<00:02:21.520> chord<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:21.910> started<00:02:22.270> on<00:02:22.360> then

the chord that you started on then
you're<00:02:22.840> gonna<00:02:22.930> zag<00:02:23.170> back<00:02:23.410> out<00:02:23.680> into<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.070> paint

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
you're gonna zag back out into the paint

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.120 
you're gonna zag back out into the paint
and<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.760> give<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.000> easy<00:02:25.180> lip<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.070> is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
and you give it the easy lip so this is

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.530 
and you give it the easy lip so this is
pretty<00:02:27.310> much<00:02:27.400> how<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> do<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> zigzag<00:02:28.300> move

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
pretty much how to do the zigzag move

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.140 
pretty much how to do the zigzag move

then combo it into a Y move so as you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.690 
then combo it into a Y move so as you
can<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.830> here<00:02:47.860> we<00:02:48.100> get<00:02:48.220> stopped<00:02:48.490> on<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
speed burst we then hit Y to go into the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.260 
speed burst we then hit Y to go into the
post<00:02:51.310> or<00:02:51.550> triangle<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.239> ps3<00:02:52.930> or<00:02:53.080> ps4<00:02:54.270> we

post or triangle on the ps3 or ps4 we

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.110 
post or triangle on the ps3 or ps4 we
then<00:02:55.420> start<00:02:55.690> backing<00:02:55.930> down<00:02:56.260> our<00:02:56.440> opponent<00:02:56.920> and
