00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.350
 hello people and I wish you that 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.690
 per christmas and maybe one more 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.660
 few happy holidays if there us 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.860
 do not hear or see no idea and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.380
 What it really looks like here 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.760
 small little advertising makes video for 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.810
 my main christmas special on my 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.310
 live channel 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 why is that mainly up now? 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.660
 a live channel from the ground, fall 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.800
 I have more of what to do with live 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.550
 Here you can have a look 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.169
 show cutout 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.169
 george is a piece of video 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.720
 he has seen that now and it thinks 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.010
 so you should go with the werder 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.239
 no idea I do not make them 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.440
 Christmas always some shit and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.120
 last year whatever 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.950
 that was just bad luck for christmas 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.580
 and this time it's the same 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.629
 bear los yes wish he does not want 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.980
 So he just wants to be disturbed 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.420
 have his rest that is the bunch of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.190
 santa claus pretty modest though 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.350
 You can just watch the video 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.479
 watching the christmas special video yes 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.100
 That's how you know each other and what you do here 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.240
 Just sit a few cool moments 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.149
 because I just had a bit 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.979
 gambled and for example here that is 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.450
 completely new, so I have the same 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.850
 intentionally a combination we take 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.560
 Now take the village as one and 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.880
 I really go with strategies and 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.740
 family all a bit with 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.330
 my eggs and with my cancer and 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.560
 I have to say that's that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.850
 got really hot 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 here's the job 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.810
 So I really do not have any 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.729
 opponents seen at once as I have to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.960
 say there are two and come at once 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.179
 suddenly two opponents because you may 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.380
 some spontaneously normal spawn and then 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.329
 I tried it a bit 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.319
 to harm one mg l and that he does 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.609
 I do not meet for the reason 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.859
 Behavior by the area then flies 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.780
 came suddenly as he is second and 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.979
 it works so perfectly the other way 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 died and I have with them right away 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.280
 popped off well and i have to if 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.539
 I stayed here a bit 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.380
 but is a bit spectacular 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.329
 been 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.429
 and then they wanted me years ago and 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.170
 then I have a guy 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.170
 worst ice but with the death torn 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.239
 So I do not know if made the round 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.220
 to drive 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.900
 yes and then I was also asked 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.819
 that's just my little one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 announcement video for you that you 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.349
 Do not worry about that now 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.640
 now no christmas special comes because 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.790
 my christmas cookies from the blues 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.940
 another channel below is left and yes 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.829
 look at you and have a nice christmas 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.829
 wish your solemn gamer
