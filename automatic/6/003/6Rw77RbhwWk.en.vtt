sort of literary reference we wanted a

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.370 
sort of literary reference we wanted a
game<00:01:34.060> with<00:01:35.060> my<00:01:35.240> mechanics<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.960> stuff<00:01:36.140> that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
game with my mechanics and stuff that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.610 
game with my mechanics and stuff that
are<00:01:36.680> focused<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.820> colonial<00:01:38.630> period<00:01:38.659> 1880

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
are focused on the colonial period 1880

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.310 
are focused on the colonial period 1880
forward<00:01:40.250> with<00:01:40.490> all<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:41.090> concepts<00:01:41.810> out<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.200> it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
forward with all the concepts out of it

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.260 
forward with all the concepts out of it
and<00:01:42.590> we<00:01:42.830> thought<00:01:43.540> colonialism<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.810> not<00:01:45.170> just

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
and we thought colonialism is not just

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.410 
and we thought colonialism is not just
glory<00:01:47.270> for<00:01:47.510> your<00:01:47.600> country<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.270> resources<00:01:50.270> are

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
glory for your country and resources are

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.940 
glory for your country and resources are
making<00:01:50.750> yourself<00:01:50.840> powerful<00:01:51.530> there's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
making yourself powerful there's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.760 
making yourself powerful there's
downside<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.820> colonialism<00:01:53.390> as<00:01:53.720> well<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.290> at

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770

darkness into in terms of like the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.720 
darkness into in terms of like the
gameplay<00:02:26.569> uh<00:02:28.269> it's<00:02:29.269> not<00:02:29.390> really<00:02:29.989> that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
gameplay uh it's not really that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.949 
gameplay uh it's not really that
immediately<00:02:32.950> emergent<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.599> there

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
immediately emergent on that but there

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.530 
immediately emergent on that but there
are<00:02:36.200> that's<00:02:36.799> more<00:02:37.099> of<00:02:37.219> like<00:02:37.249> a<00:02:37.609> subdued<00:02:38.150> thing

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
are that's more of like a subdued thing

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.119 
are that's more of like a subdued thing
and<00:02:38.749> it's<00:02:38.900> not<00:02:38.959> really<00:02:39.319> game<00:02:39.560> mechanic

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
and it's not really game mechanic

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.350 
and it's not really game mechanic
because

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
because

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.680 
because
that<00:02:42.360> would<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> little<00:02:43.200> bit<00:02:43.440> on

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
that would be a little bit on

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.860 
that would be a little bit on
uncomfortable<00:02:45.690> icing<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:48.750> is

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
uncomfortable icing but but there is

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.990 
uncomfortable icing but but there is
that<00:02:49.110> tone<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.800> maybe<00:02:50.100> yeah<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.570> not<00:02:52.080> just

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
that tone to it maybe yeah it's not just

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.960 
that tone to it maybe yeah it's not just
making<00:02:54.000> yourself<00:02:54.240> more<00:02:54.690> powerful<00:02:55.230> there<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
making yourself more powerful there is

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.630 
making yourself more powerful there is
not<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:58.460> it's<00:02:59.460> it's<00:02:59.850> not<00:03:00.300> really<00:03:00.540> good<00:03:01.640> so

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
not really it's it's not really good so

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.610 
not really it's it's not really good so
you<00:03:02.970> spoke<00:03:03.420> about<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.870> mechanics<00:03:04.410> that's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
you spoke about the mechanics that's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.100 
you spoke about the mechanics that's
sort<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.160> colonization<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.510> sort<00:03:07.020> of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
sort of the colonization and sort of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.370 
sort of the colonization and sort of
bringing<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.980> Africa<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.730> all<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.120> stuff

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
bringing it to Africa and all that stuff

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.080 
bringing it to Africa and all that stuff
what<00:03:10.380> kind<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> mechanics<00:03:11.160> are<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.490> adding<00:03:11.820> it

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
what kind of mechanics are you adding it

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.480 
what kind of mechanics are you adding it
to<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.840> sort<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.140> facilitate<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:14.040> this

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
to to sort of facilitate this this

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.510 
to to sort of facilitate this this
aspect<00:03:15.080> there's<00:03:16.080> two<00:03:16.740> very<00:03:16.950> interesting

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
aspect there's two very interesting

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.190 
aspect there's two very interesting
thing<00:03:17.700> first<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.120> all<00:03:18.240> there's<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.900> new

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
thing first of all there's a new

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.190 
thing first of all there's a new
colonization<00:03:19.650> mechanic<00:03:20.550> we're<00:03:21.050> wearing<00:03:22.050> you

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
colonization mechanic we're wearing you

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.680 
colonization mechanic we're wearing you
like<00:03:22.410> two<00:03:22.980> different<00:03:23.190> actions<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:24.060> create

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
like two different actions to create

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.330 
like two different actions to create
your<00:03:24.810> colonies<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.380> create<00:03:25.770> conflicts<00:03:26.250> or

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
your colonies to create conflicts or

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370 
your colonies to create conflicts or
recalling<00:03:26.850> it's<00:03:26.970> not<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.360> plunking<00:03:28.350> down

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
recalling it's not just plunking down

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.810 
recalling it's not just plunking down
the<00:03:28.709> mark<00:03:28.950> you're<00:03:29.160> saying<00:03:29.370> we<00:03:29.489> want<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
the mark you're saying we want the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.240 
the mark you're saying we want the
colony<00:03:30.270> there<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:31.230> what's<00:03:31.440> most<00:03:31.650> important

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
colony there but what's most important

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.690 
colony there but what's most important
feature<00:03:33.150> wise<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:34.280> really<00:03:35.280> what<00:03:35.400> we<00:03:35.550> would

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
feature wise is really what we would

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.110 
feature wise is really what we would
call<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.239> crisis<00:03:36.959> system<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.940> crisis<00:03:38.940> is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
call the crisis system a crisis is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.870 
call the crisis system a crisis is
something<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.290> do<00:03:40.500> not<00:03:40.770> when<00:03:41.489> your<00:03:41.670> great

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
something you do not when your great

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.820 
something you do not when your great
power<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.420> but<00:03:42.660> other<00:03:42.930> countries<00:03:43.410> do<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
power but but other countries do a

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.229 
power but but other countries do a
crisis<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.480> plunk<00:03:45.780> down<00:03:45.870> or<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:47.820> for

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
crisis is you plunk down or you like for

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.870 
crisis is you plunk down or you like for
example<00:03:48.330> Greece<00:03:48.840> they<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:50.100> say<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.489> okay

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
example Greece they can say that okay

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.960 
example Greece they can say that okay
and<00:03:51.380> we<00:03:52.380> are<00:03:52.799> dismal<00:03:53.220> nation<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:53.730> there's<00:03:53.910> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
and we are dismal nation but there's a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.740 
and we are dismal nation but there's a
bunch<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.360> Greek<00:03:54.660> speakers<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.500> Turkey<00:03:56.400> and

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
bunch of Greek speakers in Turkey and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.289 
bunch of Greek speakers in Turkey and
there<00:03:57.750> should<00:03:57.930> be<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.160> crisis<00:03:59.160> or<00:03:59.370> we<00:04:00.060> should

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
there should be a crisis or we should

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.660 
there should be a crisis or we should
have<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> movement<00:04:01.049> there<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:01.590> unification<00:04:02.250> of

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
have a movement there for unification of

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
have a movement there for unification of
the<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.660> Greeks<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:06.000> try<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.299> gather

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
the of the Greeks then you try to gather

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.750 
the of the Greeks then you try to gather
up<00:04:06.900> support<00:04:07.290> from<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.530> great<00:04:07.739> power<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.340> as

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
up support from a great power and as

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.039 
up support from a great power and as
soon<00:04:08.850> as<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.090> got<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.390> support<00:04:09.840> and

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
soon as you got the support and

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.190 
soon as you got the support and
flashpoints<00:04:11.150> temperature<00:04:12.150> grows<00:04:12.570> high

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
flashpoints temperature grows high

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.199 
flashpoints temperature grows high
enough<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.739> get<00:04:14.010> an<00:04:14.190> international<00:04:14.760> crisis

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
enough you get an international crisis

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.320 
enough you get an international crisis
and<00:04:15.919> all<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.280> ties<00:04:17.489> into<00:04:17.700> colonial

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
and all of this ties into colonial

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.270 
and all of this ties into colonial
expansion<00:04:18.750> as<00:04:19.080> well<00:04:19.290> but<00:04:19.440> when<00:04:19.890> there's<00:04:20.220> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
expansion as well but when there's a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.070 
expansion as well but when there's a
crisis<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:22.790> all<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:24.240> great<00:04:24.450> powers<00:04:24.840> all

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
crisis and the all the great powers all

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.469 
crisis and the all the great powers all
eight<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.350> them<00:04:25.560> has<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.310> eventually<00:04:26.610> pick<00:04:27.450> a

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
eight of them has to eventually pick a

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.640 
eight of them has to eventually pick a
side<00:04:27.840> or<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:29.810> if<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:30.960> don't<00:04:31.140> pick<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.350> side

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
side or it and if you don't pick a side

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.140 
side or it and if you don't pick a side
when<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.010> temperatures<00:04:32.430> are<00:04:32.460> good<00:04:32.610> maximum

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
when the temperatures are good maximum

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.230 
when the temperatures are good maximum
your<00:04:33.600> country<00:04:34.020> lose<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.380> lot<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.800> prestige<00:04:35.240> yeah

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
your country lose a lot of prestige yeah

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.330 
your country lose a lot of prestige yeah
but<00:04:36.479> if<00:04:36.690> you're<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:36.960> also<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.860> side<00:04:38.070> that

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
but if you're on also on the side that

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.110 
but if you're on also on the side that
that<00:04:39.180> eventually<00:04:39.840> backs<00:04:40.110> down<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:41.700> also<00:04:41.850> lose

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
that eventually backs down you also lose

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.320 
that eventually backs down you also lose
per<00:04:42.360> station<00:04:42.600> but<00:04:43.320> if<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.620> ones<00:04:44.370> other<00:04:45.120> ones

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
per station but if the ones other ones

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.540 
per station but if the ones other ones
of<00:04:45.660> course<00:04:45.840> gain<00:04:46.200> prestige<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.130> result

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
of course gain prestige and the result

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.930 
of course gain prestige and the result
of<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.720> crisis<00:04:49.140> when<00:04:49.380> me<00:04:49.560> like<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.250> Greek

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
of the crisis when me like a Greek

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.380 
of the crisis when me like a Greek
Independence<00:04:51.380> or<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:53.039> Moroccan

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
Independence or the Moroccan

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:03.000 
Independence or the Moroccan
control<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:58.360> also<00:04:59.730> if<00:05:00.990> not<00:05:01.990> no<00:05:02.230> no<00:05:02.740> side

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
control and but also if not no no side

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.830 
control and but also if not no no side
backs<00:05:03.280> down<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.000> temperature<00:05:04.420> goes<00:05:04.570> high

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
backs down and the temperature goes high

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.830 
backs down and the temperature goes high
and<00:05:04.870> high<00:05:05.440> enough<00:05:05.730> you<00:05:06.730> turn<00:05:07.030> into<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.540> great

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
and high enough you turn into a great

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.800 
and high enough you turn into a great
war<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:09.430> kind<00:05:09.850> of<00:05:09.880> like<00:05:10.030> what<00:05:10.240> happens<00:05:10.570> in

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
war it kind of like what happens in

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.220 
war it kind of like what happens in
history<00:05:11.320> with<00:05:11.650> well<00:05:12.010> we're<00:05:12.190> one<00:05:12.930> alright<00:05:13.930> so

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
history with well we're one alright so

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.470 
history with well we're one alright so
that<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:15.400> makes<00:05:15.640> it<00:05:15.760> sounds<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.120> little<00:05:16.390> bit

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
that that makes it sounds a little bit

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.260 
that that makes it sounds a little bit
like<00:05:16.690> because<00:05:17.190> when<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.280> hear<00:05:18.520> about<00:05:18.640> sort<00:05:19.240> of

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
like because when you hear about sort of

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.210 
like because when you hear about sort of
a<00:05:19.360> colonial<00:05:22.200> emphasis<00:05:23.200> then<00:05:23.920> you<00:05:24.010> sort<00:05:24.160> of

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
a colonial emphasis then you sort of

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.370 
a colonial emphasis then you sort of
think<00:05:24.280> well<00:05:24.640> is<00:05:25.270> there<00:05:25.480> anything<00:05:25.720> fun<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.260> do

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
think well is there anything fun to do

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.950 
think well is there anything fun to do
for<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.770> smaller<00:05:27.280> states<00:05:27.670> but<00:05:28.540> that<00:05:28.720> sort<00:05:28.900> of

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
for the smaller states but that sort of

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.870 
for the smaller states but that sort of
adds<00:05:29.170> a<00:05:29.320> dimension<00:05:29.500> where<00:05:29.860> it's<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.400> there's<00:05:30.790> a

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
adds a dimension where it's it there's a

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.540 
adds a dimension where it's it there's a
lot<00:05:31.090> of<00:05:31.120> meaning<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.930> those<00:05:32.350> as<00:05:32.620> well<00:05:32.800> yeah

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
lot of meaning to those as well yeah

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.190 
lot of meaning to those as well yeah
that's<00:05:33.820> what's<00:05:34.090> one<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.540> main<00:05:34.690> goes<00:05:34.930> with

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
that's what's one of the main goes with

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.550 
that's what's one of the main goes with
this<00:05:35.650> expansion<00:05:36.220> is<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.900> in<00:05:37.900> Victoria<00:05:38.380> too

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
this expansion is that in Victoria too

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.070 
this expansion is that in Victoria too
and<00:05:38.800> with<00:05:38.980> house<00:05:39.460> divided<00:05:39.910> it's<00:05:40.420> always<00:05:40.660> been

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
and with house divided it's always been

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.760 
and with house divided it's always been
that<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.880> great<00:05:43.090> powers<00:05:43.510> have<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.290> most<00:05:44.470> fun

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
that the great powers have the most fun

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.890 
that the great powers have the most fun
and<00:05:45.010> becoming<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.490> great<00:05:45.640> power<00:05:45.880> is<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.660> goal

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
and becoming a great power is the goal

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.670 
and becoming a great power is the goal
in<00:05:47.140> itself<00:05:47.320> and<00:05:47.950> some<00:05:48.670> countries<00:05:49.000> have<00:05:49.120> like

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
in itself and some countries have like

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.040 
in itself and some countries have like
no<00:05:50.680> chance<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.340> becoming<00:05:51.760> one<00:05:52.210> unless<00:05:52.660> they're

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
no chance of becoming one unless they're

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.950 
no chance of becoming one unless they're
very<00:05:53.290> good<00:05:53.350> at<00:05:53.500> exploiting<00:05:54.090> so<00:05:55.090> that's<00:05:55.300> why<00:05:55.600> we

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
very good at exploiting so that's why we

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.340 
very good at exploiting so that's why we
have<00:05:56.830> done<00:05:57.070> that<00:05:57.700> mechanic<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.510> other<00:05:58.630> focus

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
have done that mechanic and other focus

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.220 
have done that mechanic and other focus
on<00:05:59.500> making<00:05:59.800> sure<00:06:00.010> that<00:06:00.690> being<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.780> non<00:06:01.960> greater

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
on making sure that being a non greater

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.320 
on making sure that being a non greater
power<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.920> can<00:06:03.130> affect<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.580> world<00:06:03.760> and<00:06:04.090> have

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
power you can affect the world and have

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.740 
power you can affect the world and have
fun<00:06:04.660> playing<00:06:04.960> ism<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:06.340> in<00:06:06.730> terms<00:06:06.940> of<00:06:07.150> scope<00:06:07.450> and

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
fun playing ism so in terms of scope and

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.180 
fun playing ism so in terms of scope and
this<00:06:07.900> is<00:06:07.990> something<00:06:08.080> i<00:06:08.350> returned<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:08.710> because

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
this is something i returned to because

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.220 
this is something i returned to because
you<00:06:09.280> bring<00:06:09.430> out<00:06:09.580> so<00:06:09.760> many<00:06:09.880> expansions<00:06:10.300> what

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
you bring out so many expansions what

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.660 
you bring out so many expansions what
kind<00:06:11.380> of<00:06:11.440> scope<00:06:11.710> are<00:06:11.860> we<00:06:11.950> looking<00:06:12.280> at<00:06:12.400> with

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
kind of scope are we looking at with

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.970 
kind of scope are we looking at with
with<00:06:12.970> heart<00:06:13.210> of<00:06:13.330> dark<00:06:13.510> darkness<00:06:13.980> standard

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
with heart of dark darkness standard

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.840 
with heart of dark darkness standard
paradox<00:06:15.640> expansion<00:06:16.450> like<00:06:17.080> house<00:06:17.380> divided<00:06:17.980> for

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
paradox expansion like house divided for

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.140 
paradox expansion like house divided for
the<00:06:18.910> motherland<00:06:19.240> finest<00:06:19.780> hour<00:06:19.960> wind<00:06:20.500> wind<00:06:20.710> etc

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
the motherland finest hour wind wind etc

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.800 
the motherland finest hour wind wind etc
it's<00:06:22.150> a<00:06:22.330> big<00:06:22.570> huge<00:06:23.250> expansion<00:06:24.600> alright<00:06:25.600> and

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
it's a big huge expansion alright and

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.480 
it's a big huge expansion alright and
and<00:06:26.080> what's<00:06:26.410> the<00:06:26.620> time<00:06:27.190> plan<00:06:27.490> ahead<00:06:27.640> oh<00:06:28.410> it's

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
and what's the time plan ahead oh it's

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.700 
and what's the time plan ahead oh it's
actually<00:06:30.490> rather<00:06:30.610> close<00:06:31.030> to<00:06:31.330> release<00:06:31.780> i<00:06:32.050> think

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
actually rather close to release i think

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.860 
actually rather close to release i think
it's<00:06:32.860> going<00:06:33.070> out<00:06:33.250> in<00:06:33.460> march<00:06:33.700> so<00:06:34.570> will<00:06:34.720> be<00:06:34.840> a
