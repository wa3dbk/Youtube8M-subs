00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.429 

doesn't<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.149> completely<00:01:21.960> perfect

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
doesn't have to be completely perfect

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
doesn't have to be completely perfect
but<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.860> keep<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.130> wrapping<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> even<00:01:24.030> after

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
but just keep on wrapping it even after

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.319 
but just keep on wrapping it even after
you<00:01:24.479> poking<00:01:24.840> stuff<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.860> keep<00:01:26.399> on<00:01:26.549> poking<00:01:27.000> it

you poking stuff and keep on poking it
and<00:01:27.479> shaping<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> when<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and shaping it and this is when I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.340 
and shaping it and this is when I
decided<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> stop<00:01:29.969> like<00:01:30.210> adding<00:01:30.689> layers<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
decided to stop like adding layers and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.219 
decided to stop like adding layers and
stuff<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:32.219> this<00:01:32.399> size<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.659> I'm<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.020> taping

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
stuff at this size so I'm just taping

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.889 
stuff at this size so I'm just taping
any<00:01:34.560> folds<00:01:35.310> down<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.149> sticking<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
any folds down that are sticking out and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:46.020 
any folds down that are sticking out and
any<00:01:37.140> imperfections<00:01:38.039> so<00:01:39.000> yeah

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.720 

so<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.690> should<00:01:46.870> look<00:01:46.900> like<00:01:47.050> this<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.890> now<00:01:48.490> for

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
so it should look like this and now for

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.370 
so it should look like this and now for
the<00:01:48.820> chin<00:01:49.090> part<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.570> want<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.930> kind<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.320> just

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
do the same thing like the ball but make

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.050 
do the same thing like the ball but make
it<00:01:53.020> kind<00:01:53.410> of<00:01:53.530> more<00:01:53.590> rectangular<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.610> know<00:01:54.760> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
it kind of more rectangular you know and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.719

you're just gonna tape it down by
folding<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:10.820> just<00:02:11.360> applying<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:12.020> like

and just tape all the edges that aren't

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.600 
and just tape all the edges that aren't
like<00:02:20.360> super<00:02:20.780> secure<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.380> make<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.680> more<00:02:22.190> secure

you know I'm like the best good

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.660 
you know I'm like the best good
explainer<00:02:27.080> effort<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.310> should<00:02:28.490> look<00:02:28.520> like

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
explainer effort so it should look like

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.120 
explainer effort so it should look like
this<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.570> now<00:02:30.290> we're<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.770> make<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
this and now we're going to make the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.030 
this and now we're going to make the
actual<00:02:31.550> bone<00:02:32.180> structure<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.200> eyes<00:02:33.350> just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
actual bone structure for the eyes just

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.250 
actual bone structure for the eyes just
rip<00:02:34.190> out<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> piece<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.910> paper<00:02:35.030> that's<00:02:35.780> one<00:02:36.020> half

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
rip out a piece of paper that's one half

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.100 
rip out a piece of paper that's one half
of<00:02:36.350> an<00:02:36.530> inch<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.950> roll<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.460> up<00:02:37.670> into<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.720> super

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
of an inch and roll it up into a super

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:52.730 
of an inch and roll it up into a super
small<00:02:39.590> tight<00:02:40.400> coil

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.550 

it<00:02:53.310> should<00:02:53.520> look<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.480> you're<00:02:55.410> just

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it should look like this and you're just

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.680 
it should look like this and you're just
going<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.800> tape<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.310> ends<00:02:56.670> down<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.450> it

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
going to tape the ends down so that it

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.050 
going to tape the ends down so that it
won't<00:02:57.840> unravel<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> now<00:02:59.580> you're<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.940> to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
won't unravel so now you're going to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
won't unravel so now you're going to
bend<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:01.040> coil<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.720> tape<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.250> like

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
bend the coil and tape it to the like

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.940 
bend the coil and tape it to the like
the<00:03:05.820> holes<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> put<00:03:06.780> punched<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.620> like

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the holes that you put punched in like

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.730 
the holes that you put punched in like
not<00:03:08.190> really<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.580> holes<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
not really the holes but like the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.080 
not really the holes but like the
indentations<00:03:10.740> that<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.010> made<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:11.640> tape

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
indentations that you made and just tape

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.880 
indentations that you made and just tape
that<00:03:12.300> down<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> same<00:03:16.500> thing<00:03:16.710> to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
that down you do it the same thing to

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.210 
that down you do it the same thing to
the<00:03:16.980> other<00:03:17.010> side

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the other side

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.550 
the other side
for<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.000> nose<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.600> want<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.380> same

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
for the nose you want to do the same

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.040 
for the nose you want to do the same
thing<00:03:21.860> by<00:03:22.100> making<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.850> really<00:03:23.120> tight<00:03:23.360> coil<00:03:23.690> and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
thing by making a really tight coil and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.040 
thing by making a really tight coil and
then<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:25.010> want<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.370> make<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.850> into<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.210> teardrop

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
then you want to make it into a teardrop

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.950 
then you want to make it into a teardrop
shape<00:03:27.640> instead<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.910> circle<00:03:29.270> shape<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.750> just

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
shape instead of a circle shape and just

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.110 
shape instead of a circle shape and just
attach<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.230> into<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.770> face<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.940> should

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
attach it into the face and it should

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.690 
attach it into the face and it should
look<00:03:32.240> like<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:33.400> now<00:03:34.400> we're<00:03:34.550> going<00:03:34.640> to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
look like this and now we're going to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.330 
look like this and now we're going to
start<00:03:34.910> paper<00:03:35.150> mache<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.080> just<00:03:36.440> cut<00:03:36.680> out<00:03:36.830> 1-inch

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
and just yeah it's basically just to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.840

make the the skull head stronger and

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.720 
make the the skull head stronger and
nicer<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:23.870> just<00:04:24.110> keep<00:04:24.320> on<00:04:24.470> doing<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:24.800> but<00:04:25.580> I

nicer so just keep on doing that but I
decided<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.540> rip<00:04:27.290> my<00:04:27.620> shirts<00:04:27.950> because<00:04:28.250> they're

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
decided to rip my shirts because they're

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.400 
decided to rip my shirts because they're
a<00:04:28.550> little<00:04:28.730> too<00:04:28.970> long<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.480> making<00:04:30.230> them

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
a little too long and making them

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.380 
a little too long and making them
smaller<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:31.100> made<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.430> little<00:04:31.550> easier<00:04:32.000> to

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
smaller just made it a little easier to

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:41.530 
smaller just made it a little easier to
apply<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.530> skull

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.310 

so<00:04:41.990> just<00:04:42.320> run<00:04:42.560> your<00:04:43.010> brush<00:04:43.430> over<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.660> skull<00:04:45.080> if

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
so just run your brush over the skull if

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.560 
so just run your brush over the skull if
you<00:04:45.350> need<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.860> if<00:04:46.070> there's<00:04:46.340> any<00:04:46.520> like<00:04:46.820> any

you need to if there's any like any
paper<00:04:47.930> sticking<00:04:48.470> up<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:49.100> cover<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.610> entire

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
paper sticking up just cover the entire
