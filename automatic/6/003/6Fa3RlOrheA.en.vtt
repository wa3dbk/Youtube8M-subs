I'm<00:00:53.010> confident<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.170> be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I'm confident but I think there will be

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
I'm confident but I think there will be
there<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.770> they're<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> hockey

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
there because they're just for hockey

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
there because they're just for hockey
and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.180> hope<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and I hope there will be there the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
and I hope there will be there the
double<00:00:58.770> IHF<00:00:59.190> has<00:00:59.370> adopted<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.910> real<00:01:00.090> hard<00:01:00.359> line

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
double IHF has adopted a real hard line

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
double IHF has adopted a real hard line
on<00:01:00.809> headshots<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> feel<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
on headshots do you feel like the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.770 
on headshots do you feel like the
message<00:01:02.969> has<00:01:03.120> gotten<00:01:03.239> through<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
message has gotten through to the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
message has gotten through to the
players<00:01:04.019> yeah<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.430> our<00:01:05.489> theme<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
