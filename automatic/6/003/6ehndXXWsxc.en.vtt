00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 That's the beauty, I 'm Portuguese, but 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 this is another parallel world 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.460
 and today I have come to give some hint for you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.440
 What if I said hello? Hi, I read one. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.059
 book the month how can i you more 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 you're probably here on this channel 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 it's because you already read that you already have one 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.190
 rhythm of reading but I'm sure 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.289
 that you have that your friend that had 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 How can you read us? 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.310
 even if you eat both the book and the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.410
 What do you say I think it's super cool? 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.029
 But they never got that. 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 video for you to send to your friend and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.219
 try to help you with the energy in that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 wonderful world of reading the greatest 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.910
 effects that the kiss of people who 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 They want to start reading and I will speak 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 that she started there but did not give any 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 step to do nothing different is that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.920
 the world to move in favor of it but she 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 can do nothing against the world but not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.789
 today will give some tips for you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.530
 The first tip can not be a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.390
 ever one of the things I 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 I see more people do not like to read is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 because when the school obliges she plays 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 do you read gisela marrero ax of assis 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.609
 these things a normal child does not 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.559
 I would like to see none of this and the person 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.510
 It goes with a bit of fear, I think. 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.500
 start and I had a lot of prejudice that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930
 they are in the cloud 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.490
 Don quixote these things like that and not that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.409
 You have to ignore all this pressure. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.119
 that you suffered to read and if you want 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 start reading you never have to 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.950
 charge the law you do this I bring 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.080
 that obligation is not the second tip is law to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 A little but read every day is not going to work. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.390
 nothing you get to read and catch 12 games 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 or a lord of the rings first to me 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.049
 Do you want to catch an end of 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.939
 week event a theology inter here 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.350
 has recently set goals for 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 example if you are wanting to start 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.890
 you can not talk 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.020
 every day I'm going to read ten pages or read 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.790
 a chapter something like that goes 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 Thanks in that book you always have to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.020
 think substitutes - but nothing much 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.570
 extravagant, for example if you make a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 ten pages per day because 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 You do not go to 15 days in the next 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.990
 week but this can not be a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.759
 obligation until today 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 an experience more to read has day than 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.659
 You wake up, you do not want to read yes, but the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.220
 hosted one day when you have a test you 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.689
 You have to work it already pulls it to the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.180
 third, say it is 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.280
 keep always say around or 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.229
 know the fury tino for the woman is 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.970
 even easier since you have good and such 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.310
 possible to load the most 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.110
 thin or even a red or light 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.239
 digital readers or good second time 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.160
 I told you if you have a queue from a bank if 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.530
 you have a bus if you do not have it 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.330
 subway has how you read if you work 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.860
 in the office you know it was good you 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.750
 Do not know that you will not get a traffic 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 heavy because you do not separate time from 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.000
 the morning and afternoon project in the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.739
 school and at night is the study at home I 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.290
 it was always a goal to have in my schedule 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.660
 lunch I read 12 chapters have been 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.120
 relax by getting very tired and all 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.040
 day before bed I have an hour 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.590
 that one hour goes by - but the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.569
 people have to put routine sharaf 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.370
 fourth tip is to get out of close 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.900
 distractions and did a lot of people say that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.420
 do not have time to read but arrive at 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.180
 Sunday afternoon would become the domingão 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.799
 faustão 15 and faustão domingão because 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.480
 you should know a little is that you 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.209
 Do not like it but I was coming to try it. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.890
 spend on television you naked it up 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.079
 even one of them you may be before 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.380
 sleep at night at the time that the twitter 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.350
 little internet 8 hours and malicious 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.959
 people disney volume on the internet and thanks 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.190
 even if the reader absolved addicted 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.959
 Internet 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.060
 So every time I go to read I said 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.769
 that my twitter logo all by where 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.600
 you have time to within the book is 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.569
 connected to the marginal 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.040
 it's really good you never read it 's too much 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.560
 good the quinta de crê 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.930
 read what you already like now yes but 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.510
 complained of pressure from parents' school 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.220
 than the classic copy of the parents who 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.680
 the one in high help to know how it goes 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.870
 get rich do not understand what you like 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.239
 And much less 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 keep tying prejudice 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.159
 books if you want to see your guilt in the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.440
 stars the half if you want 5 of it 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.180
 nor enter the water with your life 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.069
 it's no use, you're forced to 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.540
 The hospital the time it is easy but you 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.489
 stay in that style you will never take 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.739
 doing what you accept credit 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.480
 The lighter I gained my taste but not 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.069
 what I do is rolling 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.540
 the book if you have any with 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.909
 reading experience you want 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.430
 to watch that boulder is one thing 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.980
 but I think it's starting in the style 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.500
 that will only make one pick up more than 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.450
 I sew eye myself and she always 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340
 there are books because education 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.769
 There are parts I want to take the second 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.479
 is the other because it keeps insisting 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.459
 time in my life in a book that she 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.049
 Vote you're curious to read more 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.820
 It's not happening at that time as well as 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.039
 I'll come back to this agent book later. 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.560
 a tip has a social group that you like 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.570
 to read people trains is great but the worst 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.880
 thing that exists is a very good selection 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.070
 I wanted to talk to someone but nobody reads. 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.320
 The one that I live today you talk to is 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.030
 a very good book is another to get hurt 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.099
 that read I think it's very important 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.169
 You have a place to talk to, that never 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.030
 was to have friends who liked to read the 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.889
 less than the officer affiliated many 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.389
 breaks that I created trust a channel 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.039
 to speak of God with someone who 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.229
 You end up creating socializing for yourself. 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.570
 talk they lucas talked about the book 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.970
 facebook pages you can comment on 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.650
 simple has several comments functions 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.930
 just continue to be, why not 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.120
 hold on is always hold and 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.340
 releases and news that is some 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.930
 thing that everyone is talking about or this 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.910
 world that she has read you'll have to 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.979
 talk you will have to do with 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.780
 even on book pages if you 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.550
 enter then it will generate for the jokes 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.470
 and various cool things about the book that 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.479
 you already read this goes that she had magnet is 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.039
 more about the release of accounts 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.690
 This will depend a lot on the person with me. 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.830
 For example, I 'm not a consumerist anymore. 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.750
 with me if I really like to buy 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.030
 one thing that always keeps the law is 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.010
 buy 2 965 a new thing in your 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.360
 shelf may from a year from now you are the 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.100
 What are you reading fast to get the other one? 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.000
 book with me subject much will depend 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.190
 person's 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.830
 the ninth and last tip that I find the most 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.080
 important at least for me it is 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.610
 interactive cnet video world if you 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.010
 Did you like the video? 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.960
 like too much crops that are higher 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.880
 why do not you write that grade or 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.050
 so I know another Portuguese if you 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.330
 likes to read because I do not follow the blog 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.250
 where it does not go to publisher site silva 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.290
 in facebook it counts several pages of 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.700
 publisher pages of books what you 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.080
 you are going there ever after 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.940
 books is the same as the child was 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.350
 elected but always had one thing per month 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.690
 when he discovered the video world in the 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.600
 youtube with the qualified readings and 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.700
 12 books in the month nowadays I want and 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.710
 easy start we gave in you see that 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.240
 You're not the only retard you like. 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.310
 of books I say this I have one 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.110
 channel I 'm talking about that since then 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.050
 a channel even liking law facilitates 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.300
 that novelty in that head to help 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.100
 beyond Sergio was already the chaparro 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.080
 If you want to start reading, and you? 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.540
 like channel 10 as the channel that 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.520
 receive other videos from the most who know 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.050
 you can not have two news 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.760
 But that's it, I hope you have 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.350
 You really do have a friend who 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.210
 does not like to read that you want him 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.040
 11 reads very little that increasing the 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.390
 frequency of reading but in this 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.190
 Video him that so you're going to me 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.750
 helping and helping in his name in another 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.940
 highlight communication and you 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.440
 want more what marcela milk system
