 some agreement that has been established 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:53.190
 with the federal police 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 something that at the central level the company is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 seeing in that place that I talked to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.089
 municipal authorities of that place 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.789

 with firearms what not to take 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.740
