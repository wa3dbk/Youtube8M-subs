crazy especially on this left side

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
crazy especially on this left side
because<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:35.729> they're<00:01:35.880> forming<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because that's where they're forming so

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
because that's where they're forming so
I'll<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:36.960> vegetable<00:01:37.439> glycerin<00:01:37.829> which<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
I'll use vegetable glycerin which is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
I'll use vegetable glycerin which is
also<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.790> humectant<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> pulls<00:01:40.049> moisture

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
also a humectant so it pulls moisture

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.460 
also a humectant so it pulls moisture
from<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> air<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.579> skin<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:43.200> have

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
also read that it pulls moisture from

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460 
also read that it pulls moisture from
your<00:01:45.720> lower<00:01:46.880> dermal<00:01:47.880> layers<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:49.200> your
