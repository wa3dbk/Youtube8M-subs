00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.589
 99 cars like this I used to go on 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.799
 classics from the steering column switch 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.259
 ruled the music then cat things very 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.080
 you quickly get used to it 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.140
 i set myself the same at ninety 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.359
 the ninth here this is not allowed wiring 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.689
 since i don't have a rear wiper 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 That means the holder Kalinovsky 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:33.900
 here respectively two switches 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.270
 accordingly , we have rights with buttons 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 then the management remains the same 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.630
 as it used to be 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.110
 mean when he is in a normal position 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:51.460
 off switch means up this 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.590
 i'm louder down accordingly quieter 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.080
 away from myself I can take one 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.290
 switch tracks accordingly 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.340
 please there is 5 6 and accordingly 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.180
 back here 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.980
 and if I take it further, how would 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.970
 it would be a nine I would have worked 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.150
 rear washer 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.130
 it switches to me 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:22.000
 aux tuner and flash drive all 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.500
 so what were the nuances when installing 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.290
 how do you see the steering wheel standing here 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.160
 classic not 9 here are very many 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.150
 bother puts on the steering wheel 9 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.750
 switches from viburnum here are some of the nuances 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 when this occurs , firstly the length to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.470
 switch 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.550
 it increases significantly 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.009
 because the angle in the eight well there at 9 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.630
 switch he more here 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.700
 accordingly it is necessary to reach 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.619
 up the switches so I turned to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.960
 the old scheme as I was on the six 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.289
 put the classic steering wheel here and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.020
 accordingly, I was already able to play with 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.959
 this is the distance, that is, the principle here 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.680
 now it’s convenient for me 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:16.060
 with my hands, that means 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.660
 but there is one nuance that is the slots that is in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.959
 classic slots wider there eights 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.990
 nine and so on, that's why 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.500
 I had to make a special adapter here 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.290
 as you see, I already took the signal to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.400
 Now it was easier to see the show again 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.170
 do two holes under that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.069
 there is a holder Kalinovsky me 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.409
 it turned out 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:50.650
 so that the steering wheel can turn this holder 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:53.079
 so that the signal worked there right here I 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 Made 2 tubes also from aluminum 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.389
 banks here and wrapped their electrical tape so that they 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.159
 didn’t turn around 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:22.989
 respectively, now I will show you how it is 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:27.939
 everything looks shoot wheel pull here 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.900
 it means installed it turns out like this 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.900
 here is the adapter 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.780
 Now he looks like in this way and 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.329
 here it is done I took acquired 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.060
 stuffy 9 steering wheel here as I did not want 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:51.000
 to break your own if possible 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.000
 always return everything to the original one 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.799
 cut down from it these here respectively 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.769
 where is the slotted part 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.400
 and made here such an adapter 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.549
 there you see here until about 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.099
 in this way, respectively, I 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.799
 I can put it 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.470
 and all he would calmly keep 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.480
 that is, I get the slotted part 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 there are 9 here 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.130
 and already there is an adapter for 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.270
 classic steering wheel that does not give him 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:35.070
 turn around and so am I 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:42.290
 I can calmly tighten the nut 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.290
 finds almost like this 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.500
 It turns out that this teflon 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.170
 principle, if there really is 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.150
 bother but you can lock 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.350
 thread to plant so no problems 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.360
 it was and all accordingly the length is already under 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.540
 my classics are getting normal 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.490
 and I calmly and by the way it turns out there 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.600
 'm wrinkling in general almost practically 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.570
 close up 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.390
 That is, I do not even know how to show 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.390
 it turns out the switch fits 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.800
 fits right to the ignition lock here 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.140
 to be even closer there 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.349
 push it a little bit 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.199
 have a little bit 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:35.710
 cut off is hard to see 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.380
 cut see you see cut plastic 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.780
 so that you can tire even further but 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.060
 here as if not very much on the wire is 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.280
 especially not affected and accordingly I 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.639
 able to bring the desired length to 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.419
 switch what i needed here 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.090
 according to the scheme according to the scheme, the scheme is slightly simpler than 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:00.130
 on classics only two are added 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.289
 relay and accordingly everything works in 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.870
 the same mode respectively the wipers 3 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:09.849
 position there's a washer 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:12.270
 already I can control the music's Well 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.270
 So
