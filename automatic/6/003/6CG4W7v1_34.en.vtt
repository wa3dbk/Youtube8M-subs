00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
only way the follower knows what to do

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.590 
only way the follower knows what to do
is<00:02:00.980> that<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.280> leader<00:02:01.490> guides<00:02:01.850> her<00:02:02.090> an<00:02:02.150> instant

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
is that the leader guides her an instant

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.200 
is that the leader guides her an instant
ahead<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.930> time<00:02:03.110> when<00:02:04.010> he<00:02:04.220> guides<00:02:04.490> her<00:02:04.730> he<00:02:05.000> has

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
ahead of time when he guides her he has

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.210 
ahead of time when he guides her he has
to<00:02:05.540> give<00:02:05.720> signals<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:06.410> his<00:02:06.530> entire<00:02:06.920> body

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
to give signals with his entire body

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.790 
to give signals with his entire body
he's<00:02:08.060> not<00:02:08.270> yet<00:02:08.630> shouting<00:02:09.020> out<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.140> steps<00:02:09.470> he's

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
he's not yet shouting out the steps he's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.830

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
momentum at just the right instant so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:38.250 
momentum at just the right instant so
she<00:02:14.570> knows<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.020> do

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.830

signals and she's just gonna lead

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.869 
signals and she's just gonna lead
herself<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.560> interesting<00:02:57.040> thing<00:02:57.280> about<00:02:57.459> dogs

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
herself the interesting thing about dogs

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.820 
herself the interesting thing about dogs
and<00:02:58.060> humans<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.110> humans<00:02:59.590> communicate

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
and humans is that humans communicate

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.729 
and humans is that humans communicate
mostly<00:03:00.640> verbally<00:03:01.480> through<00:03:01.840> words<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.349> verbal

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
mostly verbally through words and verbal

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.530 
mostly verbally through words and verbal
language<00:03:02.920> whereas<00:03:03.879> dogs<00:03:04.150> communicate

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
language whereas dogs communicate

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.110 
language whereas dogs communicate
primarily<00:03:05.349> through<00:03:05.620> body<00:03:05.829> language<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.879> if

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
primarily through body language so if

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
primarily through body language so if
humans<00:03:07.540> want<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.870> communicate<00:03:07.989> with<00:03:08.409> dogs<00:03:08.620> we

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
humans want to communicate with dogs we

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.039 
humans want to communicate with dogs we
have<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.310> learn<00:03:09.519> how<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:09.940> use<00:03:10.239> our<00:03:10.450> body<00:03:10.629> and

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
have to learn how to use our body and

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.930 
have to learn how to use our body and
move<00:03:11.260> our<00:03:11.440> body<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.829> ways<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.459> make<00:03:12.700> our

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
move our body in ways that make our

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:22.600 
move our body in ways that make our
signals<00:03:13.420> clear<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.959> dog

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.280 

it's<00:03:23.610> easy<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.000> train<00:03:24.239> dogs<00:03:24.569> all<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.019> have<00:03:25.200> to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it's easy to train dogs all you have to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.199 
it's easy to train dogs all you have to
do<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.560> reward<00:03:25.890> good<00:03:26.069> behaviors<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.879> remove

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
do is reward good behaviors and remove

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.910 
do is reward good behaviors and remove
awards<00:03:27.629> for<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> undesired<00:03:28.379> behaviors

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
awards for the undesired behaviors

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.890 
awards for the undesired behaviors
what's<00:03:29.519> difficult<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.090> training<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> humans

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
what's difficult is training the humans

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.170 
what's difficult is training the humans
because<00:03:31.709> if<00:03:31.830> humans<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:32.879> aware<00:03:33.120> of

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
because if humans have to be aware of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.150 
because if humans have to be aware of
their<00:03:33.840> every<00:03:34.170> action<00:03:34.200> around<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> dog

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
their every action around the dog

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.979 
their every action around the dog
because<00:03:35.580> every<00:03:36.000> time<00:03:36.239> they<00:03:36.420> interact<00:03:36.810> with

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
because every time they interact with

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.240 
because every time they interact with
their<00:03:37.140> dog<00:03:37.290> they're<00:03:37.530> training<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.069> dogs

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
their dog they're training the dogs

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.190 
their dog they're training the dogs
whether<00:03:38.580> or<00:03:38.790> not<00:03:38.910> they're<00:03:39.120> aware<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.690> for

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
whether or not they're aware of it for

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.290 
whether or not they're aware of it for
instance<00:03:40.530> people<00:03:40.980> generally<00:03:41.640> don't<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.150> it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
instance people generally don't like it

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.270 
instance people generally don't like it
when<00:03:42.420> their<00:03:42.480> dogs<00:03:42.660> jump<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.140> them<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.950> all<00:03:44.160> you

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
when their dogs jump on them so all you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.770 
when their dogs jump on them so all you
have<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.700> fix<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:44.970> behavior<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.569> make

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
have to do to fix that behavior is make

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
have to do to fix that behavior is make
sure<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.140> only<00:03:46.560> reward<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.980> dog<00:03:47.130> for<00:03:47.549> sitting

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
sure you only reward the dog for sitting

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.630 
sure you only reward the dog for sitting
so<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.930> only<00:03:49.170> pet<00:03:49.500> him<00:03:49.709> give<00:03:49.980> him<00:03:50.099> attention

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
so you only pet him give him attention

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.940 
so you only pet him give him attention
give<00:03:50.910> him<00:03:51.030> treats<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.540> he's<00:03:51.690> sitting<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.290> you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
give him treats if he's sitting and you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.979 
give him treats if he's sitting and you
never<00:03:53.220> reward<00:03:53.670> him<00:03:53.849> when<00:03:54.000> he<00:03:54.060> jumps<00:03:54.480> training

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
never reward him when he jumps training

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.600 
never reward him when he jumps training
dogs<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:55.440> just<00:03:55.920> about<00:03:56.069> giving<00:03:56.250> treats

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
dogs is not just about giving treats

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.460 
dogs is not just about giving treats
it's<00:03:57.030> about<00:03:57.209> moving<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.780> ways<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.260> make<00:03:58.380> it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
it's about moving in ways that make it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.020 
it's about moving in ways that make it
fun<00:03:58.709> for<00:03:58.890> them<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.579> make<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.849> clear

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
fun for them and that make it clear

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.449 
fun for them and that make it clear
exactly<00:04:00.750> what<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:00.959> want<00:04:01.110> them<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.260> do<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.280> when

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
exactly what you want them to do so when

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.759 
exactly what you want them to do so when
I<00:04:02.489> watch<00:04:02.790> people<00:04:03.060> train<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.840> analyze<00:04:04.500> what

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
I watch people train I analyze what

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.289 
I watch people train I analyze what
they're<00:04:04.890> doing<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.519> analyze<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.120> dog's

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
they're doing and I analyze the dog's

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.270 
they're doing and I analyze the dog's
response<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.410> from<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.739> way<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:08.160> they're

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
response so from the way that they're

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.069 
response so from the way that they're
moving<00:04:08.579> their<00:04:08.730> shoulders<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.660> the
