00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
time it is an automatic movement so I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.289 
time it is an automatic movement so I
haven't<00:01:35.250> had<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> worry<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.759> batteries

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
haven't had to worry about batteries

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.889 
haven't had to worry about batteries
with<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.219> fossil<00:01:38.850> watch<00:01:39.360> it's

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
with it but this is a fossil watch it's

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.209 
with it but this is a fossil watch it's
a<00:01:40.350> men's<00:01:40.649> automatic<00:01:41.429> skeleton<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.289> model

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
a men's automatic skeleton the model

a men's automatic skeleton the model

about<00:01:48.479> 200<00:01:49.140> dollars<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.679> you're<00:01:49.830> able<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.130> find

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
about 200 dollars if you're able to find

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
about 200 dollars if you're able to find
them<00:01:50.640> I'm<00:01:51.479> not<00:01:51.630> sure<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.929> they<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.229> them

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
them I'm not sure if they make them

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
them I'm not sure if they make them
anymore<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:53.009> haven't<00:01:53.250> seen<00:01:53.429> too<00:01:53.579> many<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.819> them

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
anymore I haven't seen too many of them

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
anymore I haven't seen too many of them
around<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.560> variations<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.520> them

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
around but I do see variations of them

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.669 
around but I do see variations of them
with<00:01:56.970> different<00:01:57.000> color<00:01:57.539> dials<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.319> different

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
with different color dials and different

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.609 
with different color dials and different
color<00:01:59.209> trimmings<00:02:00.209> around<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.259> bezel

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
color trimmings around the the bezel

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.130 
color trimmings around the the bezel
here<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:02.970> as<00:02:03.119> different<00:02:03.509> variations<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
here as well as different variations to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.490 
here as well as different variations to
the<00:02:04.319> band<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:06.119> overall<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.810> sure<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.200> it's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the band but overall I'm sure it's it's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.740 
the band but overall I'm sure it's it's
probably<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.489> very<00:02:08.670> similar<00:02:09.060> watch<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
probably a very similar watch that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.620 
probably a very similar watch that
you're<00:02:09.869> seeing<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
you're seeing out there it is a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.080 
you're seeing out there it is a
stainless<00:02:12.989> steel<00:02:13.230> case<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.160> again<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.880> isn't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
stainless steel case so again this isn't

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.850 
stainless steel case so again this isn't
one<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.630> tungsten<00:02:16.230> watches<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.709> I've

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
one of my tungsten watches that I've

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.129 
one of my tungsten watches that I've
previously<00:02:17.099> done<00:02:17.579> videos<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.109> have

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
previously done videos on so you do have

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.080 
previously done videos on so you do have
to<00:02:19.530> kind<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.769> worry<00:02:19.980> about<00:02:20.250> scratching<00:02:20.670> this

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to kind of worry about scratching this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.330 
to kind of worry about scratching this
watch<00:02:21.389> it<00:02:22.049> doesn't<00:02:22.410> show<00:02:22.560> fingerprints<00:02:23.250> as

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
watch it doesn't show fingerprints as

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.879 
watch it doesn't show fingerprints as
much<00:02:23.489> as<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.880> tungsten<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.889> ultimately

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
much as the tungsten but ultimately

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.059 
much as the tungsten but ultimately
fingerprints<00:02:26.549> can<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.730> wiped<00:02:27.030> away<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.630> and

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
fingerprints can be wiped away and and

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
fingerprints can be wiped away and and
scratches<00:02:29.069> are<00:02:29.190> there<00:02:29.370> forever<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.389> don't

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
scratches are there forever so I don't

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.319 
scratches are there forever so I don't
really<00:02:31.170> wear<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.739> watch<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.430> whole<00:02:32.819> lot<00:02:33.060> just

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
really wear this watch a whole lot just

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.009 
really wear this watch a whole lot just
because<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.900> fact<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:36.569> does<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.989> a

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
because of that fact it does have a

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.610 
because of that fact it does have a
silver<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.739> black<00:02:37.980> dial<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.609> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.910> see

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
silver and black dial as you can see

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.150 
silver and black dial as you can see
does<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.829> stainless<00:02:41.250> steel<00:02:41.519> bracelet

more<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.389> polished<00:02:51.389> and<00:02:51.600> then<00:02:51.690> they<00:02:51.870> have

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
more of a polished and then they have

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.150 
more of a polished and then they have
the<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:54.109> should<00:02:55.109> say<00:02:55.260> brush<00:02:55.590> steel<00:02:55.889> and<00:02:56.069> then

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the I should say brush steel and then

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.430 
the I should say brush steel and then
polished<00:02:56.700> kind<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.060> link<00:02:57.389> connections<00:02:58.139> there

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
polished kind of link connections there

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.180 
polished kind of link connections there
as<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.829> can<00:02:58.889> see<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.000> overall<00:03:00.329> pretty<00:03:00.480> nice<00:03:01.190> go

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
as you can see so overall pretty nice go

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.000 
as you can see so overall pretty nice go
ahead<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.459> zoom<00:03:02.760> out<00:03:02.970> here

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.170 

the<00:03:10.010> K<00:03:10.220> size<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.760> 47<00:03:11.480> millimeters<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
the K size is 47 millimeters so it's a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.630 
the K size is 47 millimeters so it's a
pretty<00:03:14.840> sizable<00:03:15.470> watch<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:16.370> really

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
pretty sizable watch but it's really

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.120 
pretty sizable watch but it's really
light<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:18.110> really<00:03:18.380> don't<00:03:18.560> even<00:03:18.650> feel<00:03:18.800> it

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
light you you really don't even feel it

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.330 
light you you really don't even feel it
on<00:03:19.220> your<00:03:19.400> wrist<00:03:19.610> when<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.970> are<00:03:20.150> wearing<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:21.340> so

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.390 
it's one of those watches you can wear
day<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.350> day<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.710> it's<00:03:24.860> not<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.280> really

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
day to day and it's not going to really

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.120 
day to day and it's not going to really
hold<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.850> down<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.030> whole<00:03:26.330> lot<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:28.070> is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
hold you down a whole lot it is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.160 
hold you down a whole lot it is
automatic<00:03:28.850> movement<00:03:29.240> as<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.510> mentioned

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.720 

there's<00:03:33.170> no<00:03:33.460> winding<00:03:34.460> I<00:03:34.550> guess<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:36.730> it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
there's no winding I guess that it

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.400 
there's no winding I guess that it
actually<00:03:38.660> has<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.020> really<00:03:39.110> nice<00:03:41.200> skeleton<00:03:42.200> back

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
actually has a really nice skeleton back

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.190 
actually has a really nice skeleton back
there<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.890> can<00:03:42.920> see<00:03:43.600> but<00:03:44.600> it<00:03:44.690> has<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.840> unique

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
there as you can see but it has a unique

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.240 
there as you can see but it has a unique
winding<00:03:45.940> feature<00:03:46.940> here<00:03:47.300> where<00:03:47.830> with<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.860> lot<00:03:49.100> of

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
winding feature here where with a lot of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.310 
winding feature here where with a lot of
automatic<00:03:49.850> watches<00:03:50.180> just<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.750> movement<00:03:51.170> of

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
automatic watches just the movement of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.050 
automatic watches just the movement of
your<00:03:51.470> your<00:03:51.860> hand<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.340> obviously<00:03:52.730> just

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
your your hand and obviously just

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.090 
your your hand and obviously just
shaking<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> watch<00:03:53.660> will<00:03:53.960> get<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.890> whine

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
shaking the watch will get it to whine

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.040 
shaking the watch will get it to whine
but<00:03:55.340> this<00:03:55.880> particular<00:03:56.060> watch<00:03:56.540> will<00:03:56.750> actually

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
but this particular watch will actually

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.590 
but this particular watch will actually
let<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.380> turn<00:03:57.890> the<00:04:00.010> clasp<00:04:01.010> dial<00:04:01.340> here<00:04:01.730> which

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
let you turn the clasp dial here which

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.900 
let you turn the clasp dial here which
will<00:04:02.840> wind<00:04:03.190> inside<00:04:04.190> here<00:04:04.430> there's<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:04.670> little

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
will wind inside here there's a little

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.580 
will wind inside here there's a little
spindle<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.630> don't<00:04:05.690> know<00:04:05.900> if<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.170> can<00:04:06.290> see

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
spindle and I don't know if you can see

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.850 
spindle and I don't know if you can see
that<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.210> will<00:04:08.300> actually<00:04:08.650> tension<00:04:09.650> up

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
that but it will actually tension up

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.040 
that but it will actually tension up
that<00:04:10.130> spring<00:04:10.580> which<00:04:10.790> will<00:04:11.000> wind<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
that spring which will wind the the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.110 
that spring which will wind the the
automatic<00:04:12.200> watch<00:04:12.740> as<00:04:13.490> well<00:04:13.700> as<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> back

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
automatic watch as well as the back

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.150 
automatic watch as well as the back
again<00:04:14.690> obviously<00:04:15.230> being<00:04:15.500> it's<00:04:15.620> automatic

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
again obviously being it's automatic

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.289 
again obviously being it's automatic
it's<00:04:16.280> going<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.640> that<00:04:16.790> automatic

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
it's going to have that automatic

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.690 
it's going to have that automatic
movement<00:04:18.100> functionality<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.280> it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.220

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
it is water resistant up to 50 meters

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.810 
it is water resistant up to 50 meters
