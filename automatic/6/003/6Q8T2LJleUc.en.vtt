00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.189 

half<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.309> jar<00:00:59.550> maybe<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
half the jar maybe when I get some of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.860 
half the jar maybe when I get some of
this<00:01:01.320> liquid<00:01:01.559> hardener<00:01:02.120> it's<00:01:03.120> probably<00:01:03.719> going

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this liquid hardener it's probably going

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
this liquid hardener it's probably going
to<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.989> sealed<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.650> you're<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to be sealed so you're gonna have to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.490 
to be sealed so you're gonna have to
take<00:01:05.250> something<00:01:05.640> sharp<00:01:06.080> poke<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.260> hole

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
amount of time to work with this you can

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.640 
amount of time to work with this you can
start<00:01:23.549> mixing<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.970> together<00:01:24.119> that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
start mixing it together that

immediately I want you get it all mixed
together<00:01:30.860> it's<00:01:31.860> time<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.369> start<00:01:32.939> applying

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.310 

make<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> done<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.689> the

make sure you get it done in all the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830 
make sure you get it done in all the
crevices<00:01:40.909> once<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.180> make<00:01:42.299> sure<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.659> all

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
crevices once you can make sure it's all

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.499 
crevices once you can make sure it's all
in<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> hole<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:45.000> make<00:01:45.240> sure<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
in all the hole there and make sure this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
in all the hole there and make sure this
is<00:01:45.659> built<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:47.720> little<00:01:48.720> bit<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.829> outside

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
is built up a little bit on the outside

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.969 
is built up a little bit on the outside
because<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.670> shrink<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
because this will shrink so you want to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.389 
because this will shrink so you want to
make<00:01:53.070> sure<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.820> sticking<00:01:54.180> out<00:01:55.399> because

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
make sure that it's sticking out because

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.709 
make sure that it's sticking out because
we're<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.850> sanding<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.509> down

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
we're going to be sanding all this down

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.469 
we're going to be sanding all this down
later<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> even<00:01:59.219> make<00:02:00.180> sure<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
later and make it even make sure you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.170 
later and make it even make sure you
work<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.079> fast<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> stuff

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
work with this fast because the stuff

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.359 
work with this fast because the stuff
can<00:02:03.360> harden<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.049> quickly<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.040> cannot

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
can harden up quickly and you cannot

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.339 
can harden up quickly and you cannot
work<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.119> once<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:09.080> two<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> three

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
work with it once it is two to three

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
work with it once it is two to three
hours<00:02:10.619> later<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.190> come<00:02:11.370> back<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
hours later you can come back and you

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.030 
hours later you can come back and you
can<00:02:11.970> check

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
can check

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.360 
can check
as<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.939> here<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.599> nice<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.989> hard<00:02:15.370> so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
as you see here it is nice and hard so

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.979 
as you see here it is nice and hard so
it's<00:02:16.610> time<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.819> use<00:02:17.060> some<00:02:17.150> sandpaper<00:02:17.629> and

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
it's time to use some sandpaper and

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.119 
it's time to use some sandpaper and
start<00:02:18.260> sanding<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.709> down
