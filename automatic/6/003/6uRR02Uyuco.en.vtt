00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.280
 Yes My name is Hello and made behalf of Philippines real estate Shigemasa 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.780
 Thank you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 Well, this news is sports news this time 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.850
 It is the news of Ichiro that has been very spring house these 8 days now, so Ichiro is after all 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.910
 That great big success I 'm the world 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.660
 Ichiro was caught in the shock when it came to know what became famous 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.610
 Right 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:38.559
 There is a player named Ortiz who has been taken off by an impact catch . 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.840
 Corner I know of another batting professional with great technique you say with your utility player 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:47.990
 What a great batting professional is already thinking of a home run 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:54.810
 It is already such a strong player who looks great like a monster 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:59.190
 Well, I once caught the bullet that the player shot that how shockingly so shocking 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:04.920
 This on top of the fence there is a way the audience is not it a fence 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 Kind of like a catch in and said, jumping in the Yellow River scattered something like climb 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.750
 I did you a Fu, such shock play 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 Well, by that I said that Ortiz is also an enemy saying that it is wonderful 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.369
 It is once a great Pyu' 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.259
 Oh yeah, that 's a ninja class already, Ichiro is already as awesome as a ninja. 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.320
 You once said that players 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.920
 I wonder if it's time to come 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.940
 Ichiro is still Kaiserslautern Ya' that favorite thing 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:39.530
 Dozens of times hundreds of the Toka still practice swing every day in Ann sport in Sports 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.830
 I think I can probably do it because I like people being able to do it thousands of times 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.630
 Yeah, the result of making my favorite things work 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.200
 After all people gather in the stadium without Yankees and his 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.930
 4600811 people and I do not say that Sodachi was Sodachi 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.870
 It seems that everyone has opened up already 15 everyone is amazing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:04.290
 It seems that it was like that, and in that way that oneself is still with that passion 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:11.070
 After all, I am impressed by people 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.330
 So where do you think the scene that most impressed you in your life 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.490
 Do you think 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.360
 I think that there is probably an experience that has impressed such a person . 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:28.240
 Your talent will sleep in such a place 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.610
 It is probably that great one's own strength that oneself is moved without hesitation 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.069
 I think 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:38.799
 I think it is difficult to impress people 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:42.930
 For example, if you do that sport, you do not do it 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:49.560
 Rectify Once you do, is not it full are many players I Sports 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:53.349
 If you look at your own performance in 100 people or sennin people, you will be impressed if you are moved by yourself 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.090
 In the middle of the night there is something different from other people 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:00.660
 People are not impressed even if they do the same as everyone else 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.430
 Toka what people with different, for example, emotion is in very 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:11.670
 But you may not be able to work it out Toka its passion acceleration of the person 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:17.080
 Wow this so Toka its enthusiasm are working with this softening strong feelings feelings 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:21.460
 Until now, people I think that anyone of excitement to'm So you what courted to say 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:26.110
 Toka Naa not find what you want something that now they really come alive 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.090
 Somehow this person who or what their its role is likely to say that I think we so much thin 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.800
 Is 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.450
 Those who have ever been worthy of it have remembered something that they were moved by what they did 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.280
 Please try 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:44.860
 So maybe I think if I try my best I can do a great job 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.730
 So when you do your best in a place where you can play an active part yourself 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.120
 I think it's shining and attractive 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:57.810
 After all, if it's your own attraction, money will follow 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.879
 After all, their own but also about to come to um Oh I myself of such do what is or amendment to say that a woman with woman 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.410
 It is the best I can live like 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:07.750
 Only life without one of a So I thought oh turn me when such Fu say so 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:13.030
 I thought how we face is the only life without this one point 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.440
 There is winning try doing it aware that such Fu is'll I say why come so good for life 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.600
 Is it OK? 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.940
 I'm still I that I said that I want to just own Rashiku alive 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.740
 I think it wo n't work without money 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:33.530
 If you say that you live as yourself, the amount of money paid is also great at work 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:37.789
 I wonder if it's going to be a little less then it's quite like this 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.840
 For example, if you get a lot of income from overtime work, if everyone is pleased with overtime work 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:45.020
 I think 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:49.639
 However, your true intention is that you want to go back home and play with people you like 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:54.919
 Selfish and want to sleep slowly in the morning Toka I I think that there probably would like to travel with your favorite places 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:58.830
 z I think that there is no money to try to do my best by ignoring such feelings 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:05.100
 Well, it 's something that connects us on the stomach of the person who said money 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:09.300
 I think it's the rent, your own life, and all that all your own 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.610
 It is dad that the life itself is full or what can guarantee his life 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.750
 That's a good idea 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:21.160
 That's why I think it really is important to make money 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:26.120
 Do I have Ara in but is now satisfied with the amount of money that earns of that myself 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:30.110
 Perhaps I think that 90% or 80% of people say that they are not satisfied now 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:36.949
 Cormorant that when saying Deka What do you know why 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:40.430
 It? Anymore from now I'm a 2-minute song is economy is rich or was really rich 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:46.110
 That poverty seems to be either way 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:49.000
 Is not it had been told to say that the middle class is 80% 90% of what the world's population until now 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:54.520
 Now that's not the case 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.550
 As long as you work in old days, the more you work, the more your salary goes up 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:07.030
 The system of seniority system has not come up like this ? 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:09.020
 What if the system has but now is still If you really saying that meritocracy in the company 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.910
 Quite Once meritocracy say 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:17.539
 Hear but it might be any good there is in the next car person is to leave out the profits for the company 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:23.539
 Wind Tteyuu'll have to worry about the moment who died in the can profit riding 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:29.009
 Soon if you do not leave that results from the I I I I I meritocracy is also the inside out 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:33.080
 There is no room for it to cut off anymore, so neither the company itself nor the company itself 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:38.720
 It's made that way because there is no force of about'll the scene to protect the properly 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.069
 So necessary that way, such a force or rather your own firm this put the economic power is now 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.969
 It has become 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:47.990
 However , if you think that such a thing is not enough, by all means towards that my line 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:53.100
 send me a line 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:58.890
 Hear information about the real estate is in my line of real estate 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:00.360
 Seems way why and I do not go up the salary of the job real estate went whether you that there relationship 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.840
 May be 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.230
 That real estate produces a great income, isn't it? 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.800
 When was roughly Philippines 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:15.840
 If it is a property in the Philippines, it would be nice to have a good economic revival 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.440
 Every year if we entrusted the approximate 1001000 Man When was the array 1,000,000 gave birth in me I 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.900
 you know 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.810
 If you say that real estate about 100 times that much, you can make a big profit 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.270
 you know 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:28.630
 So if there are three such things, you are about 300,000 or 250,000 each month 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:34.090
 High 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:39.760
 You're coming in, and then you're better off without having to pay for your current salary 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:41.290
 A really free life is waiting for you, so you are more like that 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.800
 Or want to increase the cucumber 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.069
 I would like to have a semi-tire in the future 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:51.830
 If you are interested in that, please send it to my line 

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:55.099
 Also sent in the above line in it to cancel any Well that time is to separate from the north or rather purchase 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:59.690
 It is not at all pretty even if the block or whether ceased to send 

00:07:55.099 --> 00:08:02.790
 You can send it to that line as a chance to have that setting and have it really 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:05.000
 Thank you for listening until the end I think 

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.000
 I will
