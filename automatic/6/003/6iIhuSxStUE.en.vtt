very<00:01:49.560> often<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.250> mean<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.579> just

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
very often but I mean you can so it just

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
very often but I mean you can so it just
kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> looks<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:56.570> then<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
kind of looks like this then you just

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.539 
kind of looks like this then you just
pull<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.079> down<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.710> looks<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.250> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
pull it down and it looks like that I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.550 
pull it down and it looks like that I
don't<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.540> very<00:02:00.600> often<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.320> mean<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
don't do this very often but I mean you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
don't do this very often but I mean you
can<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.369> looks<00:02:02.520> nice<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.659> can
