00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.930
 gear fit 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.549
 is adjusted under the arm on which you 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.780
 will wear because he has 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.629
 screen orientation 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.950
 Well, for example, I will wear it on the left 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.660
 hand and choose 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.750
 accordingly moving everything to me 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.940
 something manifested reminds here and here 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.850
 this drawing 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.420
 you see that when i keep like that well in 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.149
 general then everything is clear but as soon as I 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.820
 I put it on the arm that is it should 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.569
 look like this 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.129
 or rather like that judging by the clasp 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:52.269
 fastener by the way is not very comfortable 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:56.469
 I think here it is such a see 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.620
 the buckle is very unpretentious cheap 57 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:04.239
 full plastic case protection 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.870
 here the sensor measures the number of strokes 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.630
 your heart in a minute here I am buttoned 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.310
 clasp 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.850
 Well, in general, I need to keep somehow 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.150
 arm like this is not very comfortable but by 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.460
 I can at least watch the notice 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.580
 here's a bonent left you some message 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.710
 which I can view 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.250
 if i click on the device then 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.270
 according to my device 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.280
 this notification will start immediately 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.790
 that is, I donâ€™t even go to him 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 necessary but if we talk about convenience 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.370
 of course in everyday life it's not 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.150
 very convenient for me 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:51.520
 need to constantly somehow head 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:58.330
 turn back and forth the pulse is measured very 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:02.020
 just that here the change of baby doll is 72 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.640
 shock to anyone not say something now 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.200
 like 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.450
 76 blows worried and agel fit manager he 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.260
 ie separately from Gera just 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.569
 gear 2 scam another other software 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.310
 here the software is different you can 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:28.080
 set up the watch 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.080
 customize they actually change 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.380
 protecting the crimson screens they watch with 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.260
 very very nenko style that is 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.070
 really watch in life looks 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:49.320
 extremely good hour pedometer you for example 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.320
 just watch clock and time 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.800
 let us be here to odessa odessa example 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.470
 as an option 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.180
 these leave a stylish watch let them 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.010
 will be 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.170
 if it says other settings s 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.170
 health notices just like weights 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.600
 for different settings you can weather 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.340
 choose an application that will be well 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.870
 for example on instagram someone will you 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.630
 answer assholes in general, that 's all that 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.220
 can choose here 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:31.500
 let's type see how it will be 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.500
 the title will ring this watch 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:42.330
 and so here i have watch 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.330
 goes to call 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.060
 Generally I can answer the call 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:04.040
 if i want to ring a call i can choose 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.790
 Well, what a message in the classroom here 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.770
 at the same time, unlike 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.730
 watch smart gear gear 2 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.579
 i can't talk on this watch then 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.570
 there is this biggest difference here 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.710
 in general, this whole companion to 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.150
 the phone is not here as you see 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.580
 I can't have a microphone without a microphone 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.380
 do here because you can immediately 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.380
 say i can find the device 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.890
 gear fit all the same there is grease 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 some kind of matter i can uses 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.500
 pedometer pulse things like that but y 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.419
 I have no microphone here and no properties 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.669
 no voice functions like that 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.330
 there is a simplified version of the clock which 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.090
 are guerre 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.900
 where is the microphone where is the opportunity in 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.280
 general then call talk on them 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.890
 so there is nothing here in which 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.930
 hours to choose to judge the bath seems to me 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.900
 that all the same should focus on 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.060
 older model is younger than 6 well she 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.990
 still quite expensive 8 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.729
 thousand rubles is a penny opportunity 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.160
 more on older model on and looks 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.460
 it is more pleasant though to very many design 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.830
 This particular model with a raspberry screen 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.530
 liked and they really look 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.900
 stylish but are they worth their money to us 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.950
 no for enthusiasts probably it will be 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.720
 interesting but missing a bunch 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.440
 additional features is such a story 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.790
 about der feed 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.139
 I recommend to see separately if you are 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.300
 not seen prager 2 gear 2 neo 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.280
 our reviews on both on youtube and 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.400
 light mom good luck good mood 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.400
 until
