00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
start a little countdown bone the frame

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.620 
start a little countdown bone the frame
rate<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.310> bomb<00:02:30.550> explosion<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.390> bit

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
rate of that bomb explosion is a bit

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.440 
rate of that bomb explosion is a bit
slow<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.019> some<00:02:32.319> reason<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.150> does<00:02:34.420> look

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
slow for some reason but it does look

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.190 
slow for some reason but it does look
all<00:02:34.900> right<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:37.150> actually<00:02:37.360> do<00:02:37.750> get<00:02:37.959> that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
all right and you actually do get that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.259 
all right and you actually do get that
back<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> explosion<00:02:39.610> when<00:02:39.790> everything

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
back to the explosion when everything

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.250 
back to the explosion when everything
else<00:02:40.420> goes<00:02:40.750> flying<00:02:41.140> around<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.630> frame

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
else goes flying around but the frame

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.870 
else goes flying around but the frame
rate<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.830> explosion<00:02:45.400> could<00:02:45.549> definitely

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
rate of the explosion could definitely

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.089 
rate of the explosion could definitely
be<00:02:46.120> improved<00:02:46.630> there's<00:02:47.080> no<00:02:47.319> reason<00:02:47.799> for<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
be improved there's no reason for it to

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.880 
be improved there's no reason for it to
be<00:02:48.220> choppy<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:52.349> there's<00:02:53.349> also<00:02:53.560> these

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
be choppy like that there's also these

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.100 
be choppy like that there's also these
little<00:02:54.190> Superman<00:02:54.730> characters<00:02:55.329> where<00:02:55.870> when

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
little Superman characters where when

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.050 
little Superman characters where when
you're<00:02:56.319> flying<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.860> air<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.430> tap<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.030> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
you're flying in air you can tap it and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.100 
you're flying in air you can tap it and
send<00:02:58.690> them<00:02:58.840> flying<00:02:59.260> forward<00:02:59.739> a<00:03:00.010> lot<00:03:00.250> faster<00:03:01.110> so

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
send them flying forward a lot faster so

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.870 
send them flying forward a lot faster so
there's<00:03:02.319> some<00:03:02.530> pretty<00:03:02.799> cool<00:03:03.010> variation<00:03:03.700> in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there's some pretty cool variation in

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.330 
there's some pretty cool variation in
the<00:03:04.030> little<00:03:04.440> panda<00:03:05.440> things<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.130> can

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
the little panda things that you can

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.460 
the little panda things that you can
shoot<00:03:06.870> there's<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.989> bunch<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.380> different

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
shoot there's a bunch of different

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.590 
shoot there's a bunch of different
themes<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.459> can<00:03:09.670> play<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.239> there's

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
themes that you can play and there's

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.949 
themes that you can play and there's
five<00:03:10.870> different<00:03:10.900> themes<00:03:11.620> total<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.959> that

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
five different themes total and that

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.979 
five different themes total and that
could<00:03:14.170> take<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.709> less<00:03:15.519> than<00:03:15.579> two<00:03:16.209> hours<00:03:16.450> to

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
could take you less than two hours to

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.500 
could take you less than two hours to
complete<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:18.370> it's<00:03:18.489> not<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.670> longest<00:03:19.269> lasting

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
complete so it's not the longest lasting

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.879 
complete so it's not the longest lasting
value<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.310> game<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.730> pretty<00:03:21.940> fun<00:03:22.269> overall

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.740 

there's<00:03:26.889> even<00:03:26.980> pandas<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:28.000> split<00:03:28.450> into

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
there's even pandas that split into

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.650 
there's even pandas that split into
three<00:03:29.109> when<00:03:29.319> you<00:03:29.350> touch<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.010> screen

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.080 

these<00:03:33.650> things<00:03:33.860> aren't<00:03:34.220> unlocked<00:03:34.550> until<00:03:34.790> you

these things aren't unlocked until you

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.910 
these things aren't unlocked until you
get<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.480> later<00:03:35.720> levels<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.560> gives<00:03:36.680> you

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.770 
get to the later levels so it gives you
good<00:03:37.160> incentive<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.910> keep<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.270> playing<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
good incentive to keep on playing the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.320 
good incentive to keep on playing the
game<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:40.010> overall<00:03:40.550> if<00:03:40.790> you're<00:03:40.940> looking<00:03:41.000> for

game so overall if you're looking for
something<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:42.290> Angry<00:03:42.860> Birds<00:03:43.630> pandas<00:03:44.630> vs

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
something like Angry Birds pandas vs

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.430 
something like Angry Birds pandas vs
ninjas<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.740> a<00:03:45.800> good<00:03:46.190> choice<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.820> try<00:03:47.450> out<00:03:47.690> it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
ninjas is a good choice to try out it

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.820 
ninjas is a good choice to try out it
costs<00:03:49.220> 99<00:03:49.820> cents<00:03:50.330> in<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.540> marketplace<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.410> it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
costs 99 cents in the marketplace and it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.460 
costs 99 cents in the marketplace and it
doesn't<00:03:52.040> have<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.280> free<00:03:52.610> trial<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.510> definitely

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
doesn't have a free trial so definitely

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.870 
doesn't have a free trial so definitely
consider<00:03:54.920> what<00:03:55.100> I've<00:03:55.220> said<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.550> this<00:03:55.670> review

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
consider what I've said in this review

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240 
consider what I've said in this review
like<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.600> lasting<00:03:57.020> value<00:03:57.170> is<00:03:57.560> under<00:03:57.980> two

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
like the lasting value is under two

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.280 
like the lasting value is under two
hours<00:03:58.420> but<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.540> does<00:03:59.720> have<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.050> good

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
hours but it does have that good

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.130 
hours but it does have that good
replayability<00:04:01.100> value<00:04:01.790> since<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.690> can<00:04:02.870> always

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
replayability value since you can always

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.380 
replayability value since you can always
quickly<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:03.980> which<00:04:04.340> levels<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:04.970> didn't<00:04:05.270> get

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
quickly see which levels you didn't get

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.570 
quickly see which levels you didn't get
gold<00:04:05.690> medals<00:04:06.050> on<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.920> can<00:04:07.130> go<00:04:07.340> back<00:04:07.520> to

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
gold medals on and you can go back to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.570 
gold medals on and you can go back to
compete<00:04:08.300> for<00:04:08.540> more<00:04:09.130> however<00:04:10.130> there<00:04:10.400> aren't

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
compete for more however there aren't

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.940 
compete for more however there aren't
any<00:04:10.790> online<00:04:11.240> leaderboards<00:04:11.870> or<00:04:12.440> anything<00:04:12.770> else

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
any online leaderboards or anything else

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.539 
any online leaderboards or anything else
to<00:04:13.340> expand<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.150> value<00:04:14.780> of<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.080> game<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:16.160> it

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
to expand the value of the game but it

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.880 
to expand the value of the game but it
is<00:04:16.760> pretty<00:04:17.030> fun<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:18.080> visuals<00:04:18.500> are<00:04:18.620> really

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
is pretty fun and the visuals are really

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.610 
is pretty fun and the visuals are really
great<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:20.030> gameplay<00:04:20.540> is<00:04:20.840> pretty<00:04:21.049> good<00:04:21.470> it

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
great and the gameplay is pretty good it

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.340 
great and the gameplay is pretty good it
does<00:04:21.799> get<00:04:21.950> more<00:04:22.430> challenging<00:04:23.090> as<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:23.390> go<00:04:23.600> it's

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
does get more challenging as you go it's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.160 
does get more challenging as you go it's
possibly<00:04:25.130> not<00:04:25.370> as<00:04:25.580> interesting<00:04:26.450> as<00:04:26.660> chicks

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170
