 lighting the johnnie lighting brand 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.810
 the car handles much of the film 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.850
 car series television or series 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.560
 of cartoons also that is something very 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.530
 similar truth is talking in series 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.210
 true also this other cart is something 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.940
 it's kind of weird this cart is the one 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.250
 starsky hutch this already this first 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.290
 it was a series of the seventies and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.230
 later they made this the movie 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.810
 the movie was already made as a 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 kind of tribute to that series does not give 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.220
 they do not characterize it of the characterized 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.000
 the same actors were others but 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.250
 is also based on this series and this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.160
 is the cart 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.950
 you can make television another one too 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.680
 of series that possibly is not so 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.340
 well here is another one that is 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.130
 also the same in the same story 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.230
 this is the this very famous car and the 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.480
 I do not know it used I think we 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.850
 know of trolleys this is the famous 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.190
 general and of the famous series the dukes 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.550
 of house is also a series of the 70 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.350
 it's true that it was this series I think 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.770
 that was in the late seventies no longer 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.260
 forgiveness of the late 80's and 70's 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.300
 early 80s also this series 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.330
 she was also very famous and equally 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.060
 they also made a movie based on 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.850
 based on that series that was a movie 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.190
 about two or three years ago 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.800
 with the theme of movies come all 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.390
 those who are those of 'fast and furious' 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.140
 there are some who left first in 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.020
 a third movie and comes also the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.230
 of toretto we have some other of 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.140
 movie that is the one in the car series 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.930
 amazing 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.260
 There are two versions 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.560
 these are already part of a 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.139
 movie called seventies was called 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.560
 here in Mexico it became known as 22 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.050
 lungs and in usa with it became known as 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.169
 smoking and the atlantic 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.690
 and there is someone else this is from a movie 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.229
 of walt disney to be drawn and that 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.849
 it was also a comic from the 1920s 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:39.770
 to date it continues to follow 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:42.199
 spreading the comic in the usa 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.539
 and from there to there being wounded 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.370
 more than more we have to pass these 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:50.560
 nice cars that are those of 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.720
 ghost hunters processes like the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.130
 ghost house the truck that also 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.040
 it's three years 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.860
 first the movie is the other way around but that 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.120
 the movie starts in the cartoon 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.520
 this movie was very famous that 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.639
 early nineties if not the 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.800
 movie was in the middle of the 80s the 80s 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.240
 the 80s that was a famous logo 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.010
 including many things on the poster and 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.060
 I'm going to do the caricatures but what 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.380
 I like these cars 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.750
 this is a just without moment and these 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.580
 they came out of the brand with louis and 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.100
 you can modify many things of 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.260
 what is the original already carries other 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.470
 brands like johnnie lighting that I ni 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.380
 the brand and have it 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.770
 very detailed that details a lot 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.200
 this car made with expensive cars 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.750
 many nor lighting on any scale 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.600
 it's a very expensive car the edition we have 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.700
 a little bit of people having the big 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.680
 the 118 when you appreciate more the 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.610
 details discarded this movie very very 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.900
 pretty from here then the movie 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.750
 sensational light of 2007 if I do not 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.420
 mistaken 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:10.780
 well here is a world of about 18 but 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.120
 it's a movie that had a lot of fury 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.500
 during a few years ago in fact this 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.930
 collection has been extended and is 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.270
 extending where every p does not end 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.770
 movie obviously more cars and not 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.770
 I knew how to lead in a world by taking
