going<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.119> ways<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
going on and then the right ways to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.950 
going on and then the right ways to
address<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.500> problem<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> when<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
address this problem so when we think of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.750 
address this problem so when we think of
coffee<00:00:31.289> energy<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.200> solidness

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
coffee energy we think of solidness

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.569 
coffee energy we think of solidness
density<00:00:36.320> confinement<00:00:37.320> kapha<00:00:37.950> doesn't<00:00:38.430> want

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
density confinement kapha doesn't want

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
density confinement kapha doesn't want
to<00:00:38.700> move<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.390> wants<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> stay<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.200> place

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to move it really wants to stay in place

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.729 
to move it really wants to stay in place
it's<00:00:41.550> what's<00:00:41.730> responsible<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.290> storage

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it's what's responsible for that storage

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
it's what's responsible for that storage
in<00:00:43.950> her<00:00:44.040> body<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.460> well<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.850> mucus

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in her body as well as mucus

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.470 
in her body as well as mucus
accumulation<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.820> might<00:00:48.059> notice<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
accumulation so you might notice that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
accumulation so you might notice that
after<00:00:48.989> putting<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.649> weight<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.550> have

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
after putting on weight you don't have

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
after putting on weight you don't have
as<00:00:50.879> much<00:00:51.059> energy<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.989> once<00:00:52.320> did<00:00:52.440> before

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
as much energy as you once did before

allergies<00:01:06.560> water<00:01:07.560> retention<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.240> all

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
allergies water retention these are all

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.160 
allergies water retention these are all
things<00:01:09.810> related<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> an<00:01:10.560> imbalance<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> kava

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
things related to an imbalance in kava

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.010 
things related to an imbalance in kava
now<00:01:13.170> our<00:01:13.590> doshas<00:01:14.280> change<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.570> seasons

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
now our doshas change as the seasons

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
now our doshas change as the seasons
change<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.220> prone<00:01:17.520> towards

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
change because we are prone towards

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.490 
change because we are prone towards
different<00:01:18.090> imbalances<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.990> different<00:01:19.320> times

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
different imbalances at different times

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
different imbalances at different times
of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> year<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.759> during<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> spring<00:01:21.509> season

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
of the year so during the spring season

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
of the year so during the spring season
when<00:01:22.110> things<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.530> naturally<00:01:22.979> cooled<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.580> wet

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
when things are naturally cooled and wet

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.050 
when things are naturally cooled and wet
our<00:01:24.360> coffee<00:01:24.930> levels<00:01:25.530> become<00:01:25.890> higher<00:01:26.220> because

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
our coffee levels become higher because

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.080 
our coffee levels become higher because
the<00:01:27.299> weather<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> naturally<00:01:28.470> cold<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.070> wet<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the weather is naturally cold and wet so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
the weather is naturally cold and wet so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
rather deal with a problem then actually

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.440 
rather deal with a problem then actually
take<00:02:07.320> stance<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.160> change<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.940> example<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
take stance to change it for example you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.720 
might be working at a job
that<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.810> really<00:02:11.080> don't<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.380> but<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.640> would

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
that you really don't like but you would

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.630 
that you really don't like but you would
rather<00:02:12.940> stick<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.720> every<00:02:13.990> single<00:02:14.020> day

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
rather stick with it every single day

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.100 
rather stick with it every single day
following<00:02:15.640> your<00:02:15.850> routine<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.600> taking<00:02:16.990> the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
following your routine then taking the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.710 
following your routine then taking the
stance<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.710> making<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.310> complete<00:02:18.730> change<00:02:19.030> so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
stance and making a complete change so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.740 
stance and making a complete change so
we<00:02:20.500> don't<00:02:20.680> realize<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.850> many<00:02:21.970> aspects<00:02:22.630> of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
we don't realize but so many aspects of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.900 
we don't realize but so many aspects of
our<00:02:22.870> digestive<00:02:23.650> system<00:02:24.070> relate<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.700> our

so<00:02:29.170> fork<00:02:29.710> off<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.040> people<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.550> recommend<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
so fork off of people I recommend that

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.940 
so fork off of people I recommend that
you<00:02:31.270> stimulate<00:02:32.050> yourselves<00:02:32.560> through<00:02:32.770> your

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.780 
exercise the best time for you to work
out<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.440> first<00:02:38.710> thing<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> morning<00:02:39.460> now<00:02:39.760> I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
out is first thing in the morning now I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.390 
out is first thing in the morning now I
know<00:02:40.030> coffees<00:02:40.990> do<00:02:41.290> not<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.070> exercise

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
know coffees do not like to exercise

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.460 
know coffees do not like to exercise
maybe<00:02:42.940> you're<00:02:43.210> working<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.080> you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
maybe you're working out but you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.140 
maybe you're working out but you
probably<00:02:44.680> are<00:02:45.010> forcing<00:02:45.490> yourself<00:02:45.580> through<00:02:46.090> it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
probably are forcing yourself through it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.510 
probably are forcing yourself through it
so<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.350> should<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.650> something<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.250> enjoy

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
so it should be something that you enjoy

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.720 
so it should be something that you enjoy

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
but gets your body moving stimulates you

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.490 
but gets your body moving stimulates you
Rises<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:52.750> blood<00:02:53.170> your<00:02:54.210> your<00:02:55.210> heartbeat<00:02:55.690> so

that you're bloating is because the food

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.970 
that you're bloating is because the food
is<00:05:09.460> not<00:05:09.610> going<00:05:09.880> down<00:05:10.060> so<00:05:10.960> when<00:05:11.170> you<00:05:11.290> eat<00:05:11.560> more

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980

is not going down so when you eat more
easy<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.460> digest<00:05:12.790> foods<00:05:13.420> your<00:05:13.870> body<00:05:14.170> is<00:05:14.380> more

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
easy to digest foods your body is more

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.740 
easy to digest foods your body is more
readily<00:05:14.920> able<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.610> absorb<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.240> because<00:05:16.660> it

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
readily able to absorb it because it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.720 
readily able to absorb it because it
doesn't<00:05:17.050> need<00:05:17.170> a<00:05:17.410> temperature<00:05:18.070> shift<00:05:18.370> and

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
doesn't need a temperature shift and

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.210 
doesn't need a temperature shift and
doesn't<00:05:19.600> have<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.960> high<00:05:20.140> cell<00:05:20.590> walls<00:05:20.920> that

doesn't have the high cell walls that

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.390 
doesn't have the high cell walls that

for example kale broccoli will have so

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.730 
for example kale broccoli will have so
your<00:05:24.550> body<00:05:24.760> is<00:05:24.880> able<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.300> completely<00:05:25.960> absorb

within and every day 80% of our energy

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.830
