good<00:01:04.560> to<00:01:05.560> be<00:01:05.650> honest<00:01:05.860> that<00:01:06.010> would<00:01:06.130> have<00:01:06.220> been

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
good to be honest that would have been

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.399

love<00:01:06.670> with<00:01:06.820> nothing<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:07.540> I'm<00:01:08.050> not<00:01:08.260> somebody

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
love with nothing but I'm not somebody

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.950 
love with nothing but I'm not somebody
who<00:01:08.800> particularly<00:01:09.430> believes<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.299> fate<00:01:10.899> and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
who particularly believes in fate and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.389 
who particularly believes in fate and
destiny<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.649> all<00:01:11.710> those<00:01:11.829> things<00:01:12.040> but<00:01:12.189> my

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
destiny and all those things but my

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.880 
destiny and all those things but my
parents<00:01:12.579> do<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.380> final<00:01:14.560> straw<00:01:14.860> was

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
parents do and so the final straw was

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.260 
parents do and so the final straw was
the<00:01:15.130> fact<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.369> I<00:01:15.460> was<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.850> went<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
kind of quite intense about something

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.200 
kind of quite intense about something
