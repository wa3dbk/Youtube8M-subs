00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.170
 last year I discussed the note here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.179
 point a 10.1 inch tablet 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.950
 samsung with stylus and all kinds of software 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.059
 with which you could do things with that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.440
 stylus 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 the big problem that emergency team immediately 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.490
 it was that he cost quite a few 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 did not have the latest hardware on board and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.039
 also not very much rumbling 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.289
 performer 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 With this new version to the full 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 galaxy note 10 point to be a spectator 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.480
 for team 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.430
 samsom wants to put that right 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.960
 the concept is the same but with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.960
 much better and faster hardware 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.600
 but previous ones have passed over the heart 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.710
 I just have to stand still with 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.629
 this one anyway 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.129
 striking case all the way in the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.479
 style of the note 3 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.640
 sometimes also with this new note ii 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.950
 remember again opted for exterior 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.300
 yes that is made of some kind of faux leather 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.119
 complete with net 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.920
 stikseltje around whether it is beautiful but the 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.630
 running menie you definitely over from one and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.100
 then I'm not going to burn 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.910
 but that housing is in any case 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
 smaller, thin, light and firmer than with 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.729
 the previous note ii immediately 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.710
 and that natural progress that we 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.869
 like to see if then just around 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.490
 we see below the micro usb 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.300
 port me to let it be your computer 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.520
 depends 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.990
 an infrared transmitter at the top 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.270
 You can have four special software all kinds 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.340
 control types of ifile equipment and then 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.680
 each side and speaker push-up 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.420
 stereo sound well remain tablet 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.430
 speakers so don't expect a very deep one 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.590
 bass but luckily they go pretty well 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.270
 hard without distorting 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 however, the major innovation that comes with it 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.140
 the heart there and that starts with the screen 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.899
 that old note ii right away that the resolution 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.479
 of 1280 by 800 pixels with the new one 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.390
 version it is jacked up to a whopping 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.970
 2560 by 1600 takes care of everything there 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.080
 really sharp looking and not borrowing 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.610
 resolution has been addressed 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080
 samsung has also worked on the color 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.030
 have production because you also have some 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.290
 improve in comparison with the old one 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.610
 note ii right away 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.200
 well we have them a lot indeed 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.220
 improved for both colors and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.620
 shades of gray 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.810
 is now shown a lot better but 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.989
 the biggest step that has been made among the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.910
 bonnet instead of quad-core exynos 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.650
 4412 chip, this note is powered 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.620
 by an octa core 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.049
 I singles 5420 and it also sounds deficient 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.790
 very impressive because yes 8 processor 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.380
 costs so very much but 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.299
 actually it is not in practice 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.049
 quite so because if you put it to work 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.450
 are 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.370
 are but at the same time 4 active no that 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.650
 tablet heavily taxing then 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.760
 the four faster cortex a15 processors 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.739
 put to work 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.560
 b busy with simple tasks take the four 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.510
 economical cortex a7 core it over after it 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.739
 system because he thick lidl it must be there 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.500
 ensures that the performance in the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.170
 keep the battery well balanced 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.910
 well that battery is indeed not bad at 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.400
 our updated browse test is here 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.710
 almost eight hours out in our video tests 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.690
 briefly that also around 8 o'clock 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.950
 and then the scores are only samsung 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.950
 certainly not be ashamed 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.830
 new and old everyone is running android 4 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.320
 point three of course supplemented with 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.030
 samsung's own touchwiz interface and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.680
 That means that the appearance is complete 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.020
 is different than we are used to from android 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.360
 and you have a lot of extra software and 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.280
 possibilities gets a lot of that extra 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.870
 options that are rather gimmicky 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.060
 and will probably be very few or 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.560
 just don't use it at all but the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.410
 additional software that uses that 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.400
 included pen from that stylus that 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.590
 certainly useful 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.760
 with apps such as s note action memo 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.410
 and sketchbook 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.390
 you can really take notes to your heart's content 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.400
 create and sketch and via the feature 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.090
 multi window 'is also there that note 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.530
 parade 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.900
 You can even have two programs at the same time 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.110
 turning it all sounds very beautiful 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.910
 powerful hardware and many options 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.560
 but it is not all rose scent and 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.990
 moonshine because the performance of that 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.520
 note that immediately there are just bad 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.750
 inconsistent 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.220
 Do you do something that you really do a lot 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 need computing power such as one 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.670
 benchmark run or some nice games 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.500
 play than just uno type game there 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.960
 actually very little effort and is 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.610
 just here quickly but in daily 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.390
 use has sometimes not been more difficult and 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.460
 it happens 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.500
 arranged that the tablet was delayed or delayed 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.450
 skip a few frames through animation 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.730
 steel jerky look or sometimes just 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.870
 a few seconds and it lingers 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.820
 does not happen at all at the most 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.110
 complex acts simple matters 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.330
 like sweeping it down 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.250
 notification menu or browse through one 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.950
 website or knew between two apps 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.620
 which is sometimes simply asked too much 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.490
 it is disturbing that batch really 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.840
 to the person 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.040
 I read on the internet experiences from 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.690
 people who say they are too 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.490
 don't bother at all 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.260
 while others just complete it 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.850
 have the opposite 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.800
 I personally find it rather annoying 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.420
 I therefore start me into a position 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.890
 that I can compare very well with 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.850
 other tablets because get very bad 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.260
 much to see 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.240
 and it is clear to me that he 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.280
 does not work as quickly and smoothly as 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.780
 another tablet in this price range of 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.780
 around 500 euros and more expensive 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.070
 consider that new note ii in the 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.960
 basically a good tablet with a great one 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.380
 housing a nice advanced screen 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.389
 hardware and lots of functionality 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.370
 that potential only comes into practice 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.810
 not quite out 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.520
 it may contain very fast hardware 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.050
 sit but then you click 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.240
 we do not use it constantly too 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.889
 flights from I think if you need 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.389
 type the one primary buys with that 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.620
 stylers to get started 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.150
 that you have those performance issues 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.669
 exposed that overlooks faster 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.950
 or just what we accept but use 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.450
 him if already spacious tablet then still remains 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.650
 the feeling that he is not quite 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.650
 comes out nicely
