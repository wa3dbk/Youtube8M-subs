00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.339 
all before the crisis going into 2008 we
actually<00:03:19.090> had<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.419> gold<00:03:19.569> silver<00:03:19.989> ratio<00:03:20.290> at

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
actually had the gold silver ratio at

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.709 
actually had the gold silver ratio at
about<00:03:20.530> 65<00:03:20.949> to<00:03:21.129> one<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:21.669> 38<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.389> one<00:03:22.540> which

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:22.719 
about 65 to one it's 38 to one which

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.080 
about 65 to one it's 38 to one which
says<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:22.959> silver<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.799> totally<00:03:24.489> outperformed

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
says that silver is totally outperformed

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.670 
says that silver is totally outperformed
here<00:03:25.239> look<00:03:25.419> silver<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:25.900> an<00:03:25.989> industrial<00:03:26.230> metal

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
here look silver is an industrial metal

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.319 
here look silver is an industrial metal
but<00:03:27.009> silver<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.459> me<00:03:27.579> does<00:03:27.790> not<00:03:27.819> have<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
but silver to me does not have the

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.659 
but silver to me does not have the
universality<00:03:29.079> at<00:03:29.739> least<00:03:29.979> especially<00:03:30.549> in<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
universality at least especially in the

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.099 
universality at least especially in the
central<00:03:30.939> bank<00:03:31.090> diversification<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:31.900> gold

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
central bank diversification as gold

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.869 
central bank diversification as gold
silver<00:03:32.229> being<00:03:32.769> used<00:03:32.979> as<00:03:33.129> it<00:03:33.250> as<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.400> cheaper

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
silver being used as it as a cheaper

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.179 
silver being used as it as a cheaper
alternative<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:34.540> gold<00:03:34.930> more<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:36.009> than

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
alternative to gold more so really than

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.740 
alternative to gold more so really than
the<00:03:36.280> industrial<00:03:36.790> play<00:03:37.000> anyway<00:03:37.299> right<00:03:37.509> it

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
the industrial play anyway right it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.939 
the industrial play anyway right it
looked<00:03:37.989> their<00:03:38.139> industrial<00:03:38.379> plays<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.769> brought

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
looked their industrial plays I brought

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.289 
looked their industrial plays I brought
it<00:03:39.069> up<00:03:39.129> yesterday<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.609> can<00:03:39.909> use<00:03:40.030> them<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.239> the

the Julie part of the silver trade is

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.830 
the Julie part of the silver trade is
significant<00:03:44.199> however<00:03:44.579> 38<00:03:45.579> 21<00:03:45.819> verses<00:03:46.150> 65<00:03:46.629> over
