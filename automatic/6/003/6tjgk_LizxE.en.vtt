so<00:02:07.380> conditions<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.009> improved<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so conditions have improved but to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
so conditions have improved but to

tonight<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> not<00:02:13.440> drop

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
tonight it's going to not drop

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.640 
tonight it's going to not drop
rapidly<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.520> again<00:02:15.020> at<00:02:16.020> least<00:02:16.140> Birmingham

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
rapidly but again at least Birmingham

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.890

will go below freezing Tuscaloosa it'll

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.710 
will go below freezing Tuscaloosa it'll
be<00:02:18.990> close<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.830> they'll<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.010> down<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.280> 32

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
be close I think they'll get down to 32

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.180 
be close I think they'll get down to 32
but<00:02:21.720> clearly<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.290> concern<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.920> there<00:02:23.040> will

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
but clearly this concern that there will

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.510 
but clearly this concern that there will
be<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.990> icy<00:02:24.990> spots<00:02:25.350> IC<00:02:25.740> travel<00:02:26.190> tonight

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
be some more icy spots IC travel tonight

this morning from six until noon we

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.360

think that most of the precipitation
tonight<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.540> tomorrow<00:03:12.810> will<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.860> not<00:03:14.280> enough

dry and there's sunday we got rain
coming<00:05:31.889> in<00:05:32.250> from<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.520> northwest<00:05:32.970> sunday<00:05:33.330> will

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
likely be in the low 50s and that next

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.070 
likely be in the low 50s and that next
impulse<00:05:36.180> could<00:05:36.419> bring<00:05:36.599> some<00:05:36.780> rain<00:05:36.930> maybe

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
impulse could bring some rain maybe

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.629 
impulse could bring some rain maybe
Sunday<00:05:37.470> night<00:05:37.620> or<00:05:37.650> Monday<00:05:37.770> there's<00:05:38.250> Monday

Sunday night or Monday there's Monday

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.010 
Sunday night or Monday there's Monday
and<00:05:38.729> you<00:05:38.759> cease<00:05:39.000> kind<00:05:39.150> of<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.270> weakening<00:05:39.630> system

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
and you cease kind of a weakening system

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.659 
and you cease kind of a weakening system
that<00:05:40.169> rainfall<00:05:40.949> announced<00:05:41.190> would<00:05:41.340> not<00:05:41.460> be<00:05:41.580> all

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
that rainfall announced would not be all

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.550 
that rainfall announced would not be all
that<00:05:41.699> impressive<00:05:42.150> but<00:05:42.330> again<00:05:42.659> certainly<00:05:43.440> at

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
that impressive but again certainly at

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.100 
that impressive but again certainly at
this<00:05:43.710> point<00:05:43.919> looks<00:05:44.130> like<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.370> will<00:05:44.460> be<00:05:44.520> all

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
this point looks like it will be all

this point looks like it will be all
rain<00:05:46.110> Sunday<00:05:46.830> night<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.009> Monday<00:05:47.219> when<00:05:47.669> that

gets<00:05:47.909> in<00:05:48.120> here<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.330> probably<00:05:48.719> not<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.139> much

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
gets in here and probably not that much

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.770 
gets in here and probably not that much
well<00:05:50.370> check<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.699> in<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:50.849> forecast<00:05:51.270> period<00:05:51.360> on

notice<00:06:24.479> how<00:06:24.599> it<00:06:24.840> trends<00:06:25.259> neutral<00:06:25.680> de<00:06:25.800> positive

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
notice how it trends neutral de positive

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.550 
notice how it trends neutral de positive
and<00:06:26.550> about<00:06:27.240> 10<00:06:27.449> to<00:06:27.570> 15<00:06:27.690> days<00:06:28.139> and<00:06:28.320> that<00:06:28.380> would

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
and about 10 to 15 days and that would

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.620 
and about 10 to 15 days and that would
certainly<00:06:28.590> support<00:06:29.070> that<00:06:29.310> when<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.030> nao<00:06:30.300> goes

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
certainly support that when the nao goes

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.870 
certainly support that when the nao goes
positive<00:06:31.139> that<00:06:31.949> supports<00:06:32.340> the<00:06:32.430> trough<00:06:32.699> out

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
positive that supports the trough out

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.730 
positive that supports the trough out
west<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.449> ridging<00:06:33.780> in<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:33.960> east<00:06:34.169> so<00:06:34.530> that

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
west and ridging in the east so that

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.769

would shunt the really cold air out to

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.110 
would shunt the really cold air out to
the<00:06:36.900> west<00:06:37.139> and<00:06:38.099> we<00:06:38.219> do<00:06:38.370> note<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.789> Arctic

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
nao it's hard to get that down in here

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.760 
nao it's hard to get that down in here
so<00:06:45.090> we<00:06:45.210> just<00:06:45.420> wondered<00:06:45.870> maybe<00:06:46.170> this<00:06:46.500> is<00:06:46.650> the

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
so we just wondered maybe this is the

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.190 
so we just wondered maybe this is the
worst<00:06:46.950> winter<00:06:47.280> has<00:06:47.430> to<00:06:47.580> offer<00:06:47.760> this<00:06:48.060> week<00:06:48.300> but

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
worst winter has to offer this week but

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.130 
worst winter has to offer this week but
who<00:06:49.350> knows<00:06:49.710> it's<00:06:50.040> very<00:06:50.340> early<00:06:50.700> in<00:06:50.730> the<00:06:50.820> season

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
who knows it's very early in the season

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.450 
who knows it's very early in the season
we'll<00:06:52.140> just<00:06:52.260> have<00:06:52.380> to<00:06:52.500> wait<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:52.680> see<00:06:52.860> that's

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
we'll just have to wait and see that's

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.740 
we'll just have to wait and see that's
it<00:06:53.580> for<00:06:53.700> the<00:06:53.760> weather<00:06:53.910> extreme<00:06:54.330> video<00:06:54.510> today
