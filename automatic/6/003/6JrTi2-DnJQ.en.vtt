info<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.610> though<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.909> far<00:01:06.090> as

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
info out on right now though as far as

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.719 
info out on right now though as far as
reviews<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:06.869> they're<00:01:07.140> relatively<00:01:07.500> new

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
reviews I think they're relatively new

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.130 
reviews I think they're relatively new
but<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.000> got<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.180> bass<00:01:09.510> boosting<00:01:09.990> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
but so they got some bass boosting in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.679 
but so they got some bass boosting in
them<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.280> 40<00:01:11.640> millimeter<00:01:12.119> driver<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
them they got 40 millimeter driver you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
them they got 40 millimeter driver you
know<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.020> reproduces<00:01:13.710> natural<00:01:14.189> powerful

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
know which reproduces natural powerful

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.240 
know which reproduces natural powerful
bass<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.840> 20<00:01:16.170> hours<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.439> play<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:16.799> with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
bass it's got 20 hours of play time with

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
bass it's got 20 hours of play time with
four<00:01:17.490> hours<00:01:17.820> charging<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> guess<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:19.560> have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
four hours charging so I guess they have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
four hours charging so I guess they have
a<00:01:19.740> rechargeable<00:01:20.159> battery<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:20.970> which<00:01:21.090> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
a rechargeable battery in there which is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.780 
a rechargeable battery in there which is
pretty<00:01:21.390> nice<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:22.650> got<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> NFC<00:01:23.340> OneTouch

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pretty nice it's got the NFC OneTouch

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
pretty nice it's got the NFC OneTouch
connection<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.659> um<00:01:24.869> pretty<00:01:25.530> much<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.009> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
connection so it's um pretty much if you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.499 
connection so it's um pretty much if you
got<00:01:26.220> NFC<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:26.850> phone<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.270> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
got NFC on your phone you can just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.789 
got NFC on your phone you can just
pretty<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.020> put<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.380> next<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
pretty much put it next to the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
pretty much put it next to the
headphones<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.430> I'll<00:01:29.579> pair<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
headphones then I'll pair just like that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.550 
headphones then I'll pair just like that
for<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.729> not<00:01:32.729> too<00:01:32.909> bad<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.560> that's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
for you so not too bad and that's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
for you so not too bad and that's
premature<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> Box<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.670> simplistic

turn that on or off you got your micro

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.270 
turn that on or off you got your micro
USB<00:03:04.519> charging<00:03:05.359> port<00:03:05.750> they<00:03:06.440> input<00:03:06.650> their<00:03:07.099> which

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
USB charging port they input their which

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.550 
USB charging port they input their which
do<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> 3.5<00:03:08.090> millimeter<00:03:08.569> jack<00:03:08.629> and<00:03:09.440> your

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
do a 3.5 millimeter jack and your

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.229 
do a 3.5 millimeter jack and your
microphones<00:03:09.980> right<00:03:10.129> there<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.609> guess<00:03:10.970> you

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
microphones right there so I guess you

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.059 
microphones right there so I guess you
could<00:03:11.420> actually<00:03:11.569> use<00:03:11.930> these<00:03:12.139> even<00:03:12.829> with<00:03:12.950> like

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
could actually use these even with like

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.789 
could actually use these even with like
a<00:03:13.159> ps3<00:03:13.670> ps4<00:03:14.109> if<00:03:15.109> you<00:03:15.230> want<00:03:15.379> to<00:03:15.440> place<00:03:15.590> calls

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
a ps3 ps4 if you want to place calls

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.470 
a ps3 ps4 if you want to place calls
with<00:03:16.069> anything<00:03:16.549> like<00:03:16.639> that<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.180> that's<00:03:17.329> a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
with anything like that so that's a

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.349 
with anything like that so that's a
pretty<00:03:17.720> freakin<00:03:18.169> cool<00:03:18.199> not<00:03:18.620> gonna<00:03:18.829> lie

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
pretty freakin cool not gonna lie

let's see what else we got inside here

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.650 
let's see what else we got inside here
so<00:03:23.000> opens<00:03:23.239> up<00:03:23.419> like<00:03:23.599> so<00:03:25.180> cardboard<00:03:26.180> does<00:03:26.510> not

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
so opens up like so cardboard does not

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.110 
so opens up like so cardboard does not
come<00:03:26.900> out<00:03:27.079> that's<00:03:27.349> a<00:03:27.500> little<00:03:27.709> weird
