00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everyone, as you already understood 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.170
 the title of today's video will be on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 quite an interesting topic that worries 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.429
 really very many people very 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 often when people are overweight he 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.020
 affect their privacy intimate 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.539
 relationship and of course between these 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
 topics there is a definite connection about which 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 I today and want to talk a little bit 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 for example, there are people who like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.800
 subconsciously don't strive faster 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 lose weight because in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.489
 principle afraid that the question arises 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.739
 any relationship 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 most often these people are notorious and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.760
 it is likely that life made them 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 become so because maybe their 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 cheated can be lent and order 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 the most they just shut off from others 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
 but I think that such people are less 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.340
 because most people sure 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
 what if they lose weight 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.770
 town in life everything will work out 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.850
 there will be some kind of relationship or new 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 dating 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 But I think that this is already from the category 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.149
 fantasies of how healthy it is to live thin 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 there is reality it can all be 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.229
 absolutely not many skinny people 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.360
 confirm that slim body is not 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.330
 is the key to any relationship in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.549
 principle because otherwise it would not be so 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.159
 a lot of busy plump girls and so 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.729
 many built beautiful but also lonely 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.470
 of girls 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.840
 yes indeed there are people who 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.700
 consider the fullness attractive and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 I never argue about this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 In principle, I believe that each his 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.150
 yes there is such a famous saying that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.220
 the taste and color of comrades is not me 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.869
 I wanted to say I should not hope 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.430
 that if you lose weight right there all 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.320
 problems with love or 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.200
 for example, even intimate relationships here 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.640
 Of course, most of the deliverance will be solved. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 from extra pounds attached 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.140
 confidence and helping also get rid 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.990
 from complexes girl for example 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 becoming more confident open 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 and sociable and give yourself more 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.720
 attention and of course give birth to more 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.299
 new acquaintance most often with him 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.649
 many new gentlemen appear but in 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.899
 such a reality may not 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.850
 happen and nobody is disappointed 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.430
 loves it really will just 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.920
 unpleasant of course completeness is most often 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.490
 gives a person a wrong idea of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.380
 their own 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.140
 power and beauty and this view 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.030
 most often very understated but at the same 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.100
 time people who do not possess 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.810
 overweight problems very often 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.210
 also unsure of themselves and their 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.280
 attractiveness it seems to me that if 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.710
 man in general is happy with his body and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.720
 his life then he most often nothing 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.670
 shy awkwardness most often 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.950
 experiencing people who are constantly something 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.900
 unhappy whether it's their bodies or 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 some kind of personal relationship is possible 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.980
 something in their life they are just more 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.110
 pay attention to their disadvantage 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.880
 sometimes they just don't notice dignity 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.890
 with which they are filled 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.590
 and it is completely independent of 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.150
 Compounding true I believe that complete 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.580
 man is really hard to believe 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.170
 that his beloved his fullness does not care 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.850
 and in principle somehow does not hurt 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.100
 because many of us are really 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.530
 constantly need to kibble on sight 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.930
 from the side if a full person is constantly 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.700
 criticizes himself constantly scolding themselves 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.220
 dissatisfied with something really hard for him 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.500
 believe that his second half think 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.830
 completely different she doesn't care about the extra 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.290
 weight 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.630
 personally my opinion is that the real feelings 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.310
 overweight is not a hindrance 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.950
 the main thing is to learn to accept yourself 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.510
 as you are and if something 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.970
 I do not like working on a 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.830
 get better but don't constantly 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.360
 scold yourself because you only 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.150
 spoil your mood 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.220
 crush the people around you loves you 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.350
 so what you have and no matter have 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.360
 you are overweight or not as I would 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.440
 interesting to know what you think
