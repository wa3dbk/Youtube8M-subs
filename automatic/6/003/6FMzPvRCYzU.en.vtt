00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
from how this shot was made from a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
from how this shot was made from a
couple<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:10.860> from<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.490> minute

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
couple you know from like a minute

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
couple you know from like a minute
before<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> minute<00:01:12.869> after<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.500> what

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
before to a minute after and what

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
before to a minute after and what
happened<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.400> between<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:15.030> some<00:01:15.240> expletives

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

happened in between with some expletives
i<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.290> two<00:01:16.409> curses<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.830> there

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
i think there's two curses in there

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
i think there's two curses in there
because<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> interesting<00:01:18.479> what
