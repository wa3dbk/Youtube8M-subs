00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.160 
other video um yeah so this is actually
the<00:00:06.899> accuracy<00:00:07.589> test<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.940> new<00:00:09.179> Benjamin

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170

the accuracy test for my new Benjamin
trail<00:00:11.780> synthetic<00:00:13.400> Nitro<00:00:14.400> piston<00:00:15.619> air<00:00:16.619> gun<00:00:16.859> so

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
trail synthetic Nitro piston air gun so

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.099 
trail synthetic Nitro piston air gun so
basically<00:00:18.270> we're<00:00:18.449> gonna<00:00:18.510> start<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:18.930> we're

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
basically we're gonna start out we're

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.980 
basically we're gonna start out we're
gonna<00:00:19.170> go<00:00:19.380> from<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.520> worst<00:00:20.970> groupings<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
gonna go from the worst groupings to the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.710 
gonna go from the worst groupings to the
best<00:00:22.230> groupings<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.119> it's<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.269> started<00:00:24.660> out

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
best groupings and it's all started out

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.650 
best groupings and it's all started out
with<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.949> asian<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.609> hollow<00:00:26.789> point<00:00:27.090> these

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
with this asian and hollow point these

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.509 
with this asian and hollow point these
are<00:00:27.720> taken<00:00:28.439> mine<00:00:28.560> they're<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.859> done<00:00:29.070> between

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
are taken mine they're all done between

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.120 
are taken mine they're all done between
15<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.599> 20<00:00:30.840> yards<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> basically<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:34.950> what

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
15 to 20 yards so basically this is what

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.630 
15 to 20 yards so basically this is what
it<00:00:35.370> looks<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.940> it'll<00:00:36.059> focus<00:00:36.860> okay<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it looks like if it'll focus okay it's a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.720 
it looks like if it'll focus okay it's a
different<00:00:39.079> pellet<00:00:40.190> formation<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.579> look

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
different pellet formation if you look

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.810 
different pellet formation if you look
at<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:43.020> comes<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.820> then

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
at it it's like actually comes out then

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.299 
at it it's like actually comes out then
regular<00:00:45.510> ones<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> hmm<00:00:47.460> oh<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
regular ones but it's the hmm oh it's a

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
regular ones but it's the hmm oh it's a
you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> twelve<00:00:51.120> point<00:00:51.360> six<00:00:51.629> five

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you can see it's a twelve point six five

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
you can see it's a twelve point six five
grain<00:00:53.629> shoot<00:00:54.629> shot<00:00:54.989> five<00:00:55.260> from<00:00:55.890> each<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.489> these

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
grain shoot shot five from each of these

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
grain shoot shot five from each of these
pellets<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.739> that's<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> grouping<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> got

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
pellets and that's the grouping we got

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.049 
pellets and that's the grouping we got
at<00:00:59.670> twenty<00:01:00.359> yards<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.460> tell<00:01:02.640> it's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
at twenty yards so you can tell it's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.100 
at twenty yards so you can tell it's
pulling<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.809> right

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
pulling to the right

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.820 
pulling to the right
all<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.830> pellets<00:01:05.280> did<00:01:05.729> pull<00:01:06.350> between<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
all these pellets did pull between a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
all these pellets did pull between a
quarter<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.820> inch<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> half<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.570> inch<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
quarter of an inch to a half an inch to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
quarter of an inch to a half an inch to
the<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:11.119> seems<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> favor<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the right it seems to favor that side a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.620 
the right it seems to favor that side a
lot<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:13.830> matter<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.130> many<00:01:14.250> times<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> adjusted

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
lot no matter how many times I adjusted

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.980 
lot no matter how many times I adjusted
my<00:01:15.780> scope<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.580> always<00:01:17.700> favor<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
my scope it would always favor it to the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.070 
my scope it would always favor it to the
right<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.420> that's<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> agent<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.930> hollow

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
right so that's the agent and hollow

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
right so that's the agent and hollow
points<00:01:22.500> coming<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:25.290> Crossman

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
points coming back to the Crossman

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
points coming back to the Crossman
pointed<00:01:26.880> hunting<00:01:27.479> pellets<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> don't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
pointed hunting pellets if you don't

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.370 
pointed hunting pellets if you don't
know<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.130> looks<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:30.079> it's<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
know what that looks like it's just a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
know what that looks like it's just a
simple<00:01:31.710> pointed<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.280> kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> looks<00:01:33.090> almost

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
simple pointed top kind of looks almost

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.020 
simple pointed top kind of looks almost
like<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.540> dome<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> comes<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> point<00:01:35.780> okay

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
like a dome but it comes to a point okay

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.590 
like a dome but it comes to a point okay
this<00:01:39.030> was<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.689> grouping<00:01:40.759> one<00:01:41.759> two<00:01:42.060> three<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this was that grouping one two three and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.800 
this was that grouping one two three and
then<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:44.450> again<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.720> twenty<00:01:46.229> yards

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
then two and that again at twenty yards

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.429 
then two and that again at twenty yards
so<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.259> that's<00:01:49.640> thirteen<00:01:50.640> point<00:01:50.850> nine<00:01:50.880> greens

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
so and that's thirteen point nine greens

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.039 
so and that's thirteen point nine greens
so<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.979> mean<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.970> okay<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.630> again<00:01:54.780> it's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so I mean it's okay but again it's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.190 
so I mean it's okay but again it's
pulling<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.470> right

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
pulling to the right

grain again it's just a so really it's
it's<00:02:52.210> more<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.570> dome<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.800> kind<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.100> like

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
it's more of a dome it's kind of like

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.540 
it's more of a dome it's kind of like
the<00:02:54.400> FTS<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.640> yeah<00:02:57.820> mmm<00:02:58.330> that's<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.590> it<00:03:00.130> shot

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
the FTS so yeah mmm that's is it shot

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.120 
the FTS so yeah mmm that's is it shot
very<00:03:00.850> well<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.510> know<00:03:01.600> it's<00:03:02.080> three<00:03:02.830> in<00:03:02.950> there

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
very well you know it's three in there

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.570 
very well you know it's three in there
and<00:03:03.370> then<00:03:03.520> two<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:03.880> there<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.380> mean<00:03:06.220> judge

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
and then two in there so I mean judge

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.810 
and then two in there so I mean judge
for<00:03:06.760> yourself<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:08.530> next<00:03:08.920> group<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.370> was

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
for yourself but this next group is was

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.850 
for yourself but this next group is was
the<00:03:10.120> probably<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.870> best<00:03:11.050> group<00:03:11.260> if<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.590> wasn't

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the probably the best group if it wasn't

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.850 
the probably the best group if it wasn't
this<00:03:11.980> one<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:13.420> beaming<00:03:14.140> crow<00:03:14.380> magnums

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
this one is the beaming crow magnums

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.949 
this one is the beaming crow magnums
know<00:03:15.370> these<00:03:15.610> are<00:03:15.790> very<00:03:15.820> very<00:03:16.480> heavy<00:03:16.720> belt

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
know these are very very heavy belt

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.640 
know these are very very heavy belt
compared<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.500> my<00:03:17.620> rust<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.910> an<00:03:19.000> 18<00:03:19.270> point<00:03:19.650> two

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
compared to my rust it's an 18 point two

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.479 
compared to my rust it's an 18 point two
one<00:03:20.830> grain<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.510> these<00:03:22.510> are<00:03:22.690> big<00:03:23.400> compared<00:03:24.400> to

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
one grain and these are big compared to

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.840 
one grain and these are big compared to
the<00:03:25.090> other<00:03:25.420> ones<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.489> grouping

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the other ones and that is the grouping

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.930 
the other ones and that is the grouping
I<00:03:27.910> got<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:29.200> two<00:03:29.410> three<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.370> then<00:03:30.520> two<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
I got one two three and then two in the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.740 
I got one two three and then two in the
middle<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.440> um<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:34.060> guys<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.420> judge<00:03:34.600> for

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
middle so um you guys can judge for

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.340 
middle so um you guys can judge for
yourself<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.739> just<00:03:35.950> my<00:03:36.130> gun<00:03:36.400> I've<00:03:36.700> heard

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
yourself this is just my gun I've heard

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.170 
yourself this is just my gun I've heard
several<00:03:38.350> occasions<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.310> some<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.090> these

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
several occasions that some of these

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.729 
several occasions that some of these
pellets<00:03:40.570> did<00:03:40.840> better<00:03:41.050> in<00:03:41.140> other<00:03:41.410> people's

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
pellets did better in other people's

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.370 
pellets did better in other people's
guns<00:03:42.010> again<00:03:43.000> mine<00:03:43.330> seems<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.750> pull<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.260> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
guns again mine seems to pull to the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.120 
guns again mine seems to pull to the
right<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.900> overall<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> great<00:03:47.830> gun

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
actually just got it today so I did this

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.580 
actually just got it today so I did this
test<00:03:51.340> tonight<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.600> really<00:03:52.900> wanted<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.350> see

you<00:03:54.130> know<00:03:54.220> which<00:03:54.550> which<00:03:54.910> pellet<00:03:55.300> would<00:03:55.420> shoot

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
you know which which pellet would shoot

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.690 
you know which which pellet would shoot
correctly<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.620> if<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.780> wasn't<00:03:59.080> going<00:03:59.290> for

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
correctly and if if I wasn't going for

this gun as you can see all of them are

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.500 
this gun as you can see all of them are
in<00:04:11.700> within<00:04:12.700> probably<00:04:13.630> an<00:04:13.959> inch<00:04:15.180> no<00:04:16.180> bigger

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
in within probably an inch no bigger
