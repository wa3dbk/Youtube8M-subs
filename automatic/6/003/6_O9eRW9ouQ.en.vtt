 Hello dear friends subscribers with 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.830
 your item for today we have a review of the cover 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.150
 bumper for iphone 5g rf oh how we can 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.299
 we have here on the new 2012 2012 the year 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.100
 iphone and so who watched the video by 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 activating iphone 5 to the fact that I already 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 activated your iphone can not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.750
 enjoy the truth here date 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 wrong time and so on in general 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.199
 many will say for some reason not at night so 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 the cover is all on because the difference is here on 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.349
 really small that is when you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 dress up your phone here is small 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.910
 the difference in the ledge and while it is convenient 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.969
 so here is a move to take but still i 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 I 'm worried about the iphone, it's still here 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.329
 a little worse you can even say too 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.800
 here are the faces that were here 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.899
 oiled polished machine and so 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
 further generally they can be scratched on 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 ipad mini scratched a bit here i 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.980
 I do not want it to be and bought a bumper 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.360
 it will be just this all protect well true 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.850
 plastic bumper if its very often 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 there every day 1 day diarrhea one day 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 killed one more day brought then of course 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.830
 but all of iraq managed let's see 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 for this model you should have a party 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.600
 closer black i think the bumper will be 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.270
 white whites black 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.740
 combination and so here it looks like myself 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.180
 case made of a pony it is made of 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.409
 on the one hand plastic on the other and 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.130
 silicone like i had iphone 4 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.810
 iphone 4s is so dug out there but still so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 and do what is right here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.640
 if right here and so he was shaking not here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.060
 we have a raincoat blind 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 podnizom is solid here is such a 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 a hole in which there will be a microphone speaker 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.570
 think little is my headphones left 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.159
 such silicone keys kutova protects 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.759
 these are the adjustment keys 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.030
 loudness and also here we beat bate 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 burned black let's set our 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.700
 iphone of course it's very cool 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.340
 protection because the edges are protected when 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.040
 this if you buy at the front 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.899
 the film on the back of the minka then general 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.319
 will be very cool protection with this 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.330
 this bumper is not so strong 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:17.400
 gives weight and there generally 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:23.850
 this is not it now we are with you 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.850
 set as you summer 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.930
 fuck up here who you are all her what 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.110
 I can scratch the game itself some 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.450
 polished 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.150
 the machine itself, but immediately sat down found 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.360
 your place 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.740
 black all about durability 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.140
 we will not check that the corpses ditched 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.750
 Well, that's all our bumper on our iPhone 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.440
 how can we see all the keys well 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.360
 volume control responds well 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.480
 so true if by chance here now 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.250
 so here you see I do not click on 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.740
 the key here and so here is something like this 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.540
 minus your traffic 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.739
 works well everything works well 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.420
 the camera can pour any bumper on 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.780
 I will not check strength soon 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.010
 I will buy a film here though I dislike them 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.110
 here is the film 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.489
 i.e. here matte here is glossy and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.769
 all basically think protection is good if 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.540
 will fall and if there is a film here here 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.140
 if it falls in this bumper 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.170
 then I think the phone will be well protected 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.269
 yet I will change it for exactly one month 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.140
 I will wear it without a cover on such a chick 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.450
 or hay for forms 4s with you will be katanas 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.239
 subscribe to the great veneer reviews 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.890
 again, wait for the review of cars 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.890
 thank you all dear friends bye bye
