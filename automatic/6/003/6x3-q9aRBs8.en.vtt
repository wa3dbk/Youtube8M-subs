00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.830
 The chicken bed is the roof that remains on the farms floor after the 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.669
 they are withdrawn 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.960
 breeders use the bed to reduce 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.119
 expenditure on the commendation of cattle 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.900
 to feed the herd with this type of feed made here based on bran 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.380
 of corn soybean and wheat the producer invests about 3 reals a day per head 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.629
 we could the chicken bed this cost drops to less than a third - from the real 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:37.660
 per animal 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.550
 the issue is that the use of chicken litter in cattle 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.660
 been banned in Brazil for eight years and the main reason is to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.060
 around here mad cow disease 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.180
 the disease reaches the nervous system, mainly cattle, and leaves the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.090
 animals with changed behavior 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.960
 the name mad cow 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 in Europe it became an epidemic in the 1990s because the disease can be 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.160
 transmitted to humans 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.480
 claim the chicken bed with the mad cow disease you can see in this 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.440
 drawing 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.610
 the action of the Brazilian farms still takes a bit of meat meal 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.790
 When chicken feed on the courses he usually wasted a bit of 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.000
 stay in bed 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.550
 in addition, as the chicken intestine does not take full advantage of the food 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.460
 about 30% of the feed is discarded in the faeces 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.610
 birds are not contaminated but if the litter bed is 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 the cycle may close 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 the current has to be interrupted 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.979
 the concern exists because animals are still alive in Brazil 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.780
 breeding animals that have been imported for 10 years from countries where 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.720
 disease 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.010
 in the inspection that is being carried out in Bahia the first test to verify 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.460
 if the animal protein narration is done on the property itself and the result 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.800
 the exam is ready in 10 minutes 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.369
 should be repeated in the laboratory 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.190
 this with the end result is that the law 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.899
 can be applied on the property 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.969
 If this is a positive case, the couple more here 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.909
 when the animals will be slaughtered from the INPE in the full 30 day immaterial period 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.329
 official slaughterhouses 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.680
 removed all the risk material and taking advantage of the carcass animals that do not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.619
 should 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.489
 to win the gun that projected the house and we have that officers and will be 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.430
 sacrificed property destruction
