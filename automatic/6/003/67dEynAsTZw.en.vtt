 hi and breakfast we talked now 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.360
 it's time to talk about winning 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.970
 our body is arranged so that in the middle 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.119
 days are active splitting 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.159
 food enzyme 12 to 15 these processes 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.829
 reach their peak so this 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:23.499
 the moment must take place vitamin 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.929
 full nutrition of your body 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.119
 a lunch meal 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.369
 lunch should be the main 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.649
 eating to support us and 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.620
 Tomi are energetic throughout 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.930
 working day but also to end 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.240
 days we didnâ€™t get so hungry to 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.670
 eat just a whole bunch of everything and lie down 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.920
 sleep lunch must also contain complex 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.670
 carbohydrates to give you more this year. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.820

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.270
 pasta or baked potatoes also 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.710
 along with complex carbohydrates it is by the way 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.809

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.950
 it is also better to eat still throw out vegetables 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.229
 if you need to support 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.109

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.119
