 on the bottom today I bring you such 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.929
 it's been quite not set so I think 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 that now the hymen and still such is tip 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 that I like and that it's like a 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.859
 different point because I like it 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.109
 doing it by recording fragments of the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.599
 questions that make me then this one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.820
 is that is called a tag of the day 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.149
 lazy a law sinde is so 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.219
 consists of nothing more or nothing less than a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.559
 series of questions that ask you what 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.829
 would you do on such occasion for one peso 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.390
 or as detainees like pepe and nobody does 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 nor harshness in those days that we do not have 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.730
 that nothing to do anything absolutely nothing 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 so let 's start with the good 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.190
 fine questions let's start with the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.100
 first question what would be your 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.140
 facial routine 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.080
 for lazily good days but yes a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.360
 bit sick we're going to start what 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.990
 first thing I do is wash my face with 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.100
 my face soap for mixed skin or 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.149
 dry pulling dry and the truth is that I 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 I wash perfectly with better weather 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.840
 when writing I do not know how to pronounce 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.680
 perfectly 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.369
 then I wash very well and I try to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.420
 nito asia specific for the face go 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.159
 drying me to touch it nothing more 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 because if he has lowered it to me a lot 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.039
 over and the next thing I do is 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.470
 put on a tonic made by me that I 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.900
 I'll believe it hb at a time 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.230
 youtube is a question 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.890
 the question I do not believe the second question 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.710
 is can your makeup in a dull movie 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 the truth is that I do not maquillo or in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.110
 a lazy day or any day I am 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.540
 more said on special occasions that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.330
 almost nothing but good generation that I 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.330
 I had to make up this would be my 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.690
 makeup as I told you is very very 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.150
 basic, the first thing I do is put on a 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.980
 little bit of mascara without 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.350
 exaggerate as you will see he took all the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.390
 Excess I can and I put very little 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.830
 in which he spent his immense stress since 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.310
 my mask is new and good alright let's go 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.890
 with the third question what would be your 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.959
 hairstyle on a lazy day 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.690
 the truth that my hairstyle in lazy day 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.700
 it does not vary much so I'm going to wander 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.520
 the truth is that I do not like to be with 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.190
 the hairs loose like a lioness besides 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.640
 It gives me a lot of heat and what I do is 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.590
 comb my hair a little bit more and I 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.120
 threw down and I make a little ball 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.340
 well well 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.650
 aica releases some pearls because 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.290
 I do not like to be military type tight 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.390
 There is a terrible thing and it hurts the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.200
 head but well I also like to throw 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.640
 some pearls think a little more 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.150
 arranged so to speak forecast 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.000

 do not swing and so good this is 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.020
 the answer to the question 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.820

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.840
