can create go through the video and I'll
explain<00:00:57.030> why<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.300> prefer<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> setups

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
explain why I prefer one of the setups

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.920 
explain why I prefer one of the setups
over<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.519> but<00:01:00.090> again<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
over the other but again this could be a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
over the other but again this could be a
white<00:01:01.260> wall<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.710> house<00:01:02.210> one<00:01:03.210> light<00:01:03.480> could

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
white wall in your house one light could

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.220 
white wall in your house one light could
be<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.110> speedlight<00:01:04.739> I've<00:01:05.640> used<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.330> softbox

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
be a speedlight I've used a softbox

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.429 
be a speedlight I've used a softbox
which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> my<00:01:08.430> preferred<00:01:08.610> way<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:10.049> don't

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
which is my preferred way to go I don't

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.060 
which is my preferred way to go I don't
use<00:01:10.770> speed<00:01:11.009> lights<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.369> lot<00:01:11.930> but<00:01:12.930> here's<00:01:13.320> here's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
use speed lights a lot but here's here's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
use speed lights a lot but here's here's
the<00:01:14.220> video<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> hope<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> enjoy<00:01:16.400> as<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the video I hope you enjoy as you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.319 
the video I hope you enjoy as you can
see<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> image<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.310> model<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.000> studying

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
see from the image the model is studying

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.740 
see from the image the model is studying
exactly<00:01:22.229> 90<00:01:22.619> degrees<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.790> softbox<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
exactly 90 degrees to the softbox so

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
exactly 90 degrees to the softbox so
it's<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.170> front<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.470> her<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it's not in front of her and it's not on

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.960 
it's not in front of her and it's not on
a<00:01:26.250> 45<00:01:27.119> degree<00:01:27.479> angle<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.430> as<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.549> will<00:01:29.700> take<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a 45 degree angle and as I will take the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.530 
a 45 degree angle and as I will take the
first<00:01:30.180> image<00:01:31.159> in<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.820> first<00:01:33.090> setup<00:01:33.270> we

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
first image in this first setup we

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.389 
first image in this first setup we
actually<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> softbox<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
actually have the softbox to the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.960 
actually have the softbox to the
immediate<00:01:35.729> left<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> model<00:01:37.610> basically<00:01:38.610> if

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
immediate left of the model basically if

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
immediate left of the model basically if
the<00:01:39.119> model<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> extend<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.110> arm<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.530> she

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the model was to extend our arm out she

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.039 
the model was to extend our arm out she
would<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.369> hit<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.119> softbox<00:01:42.780> which

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
would actually hit the softbox which

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.219 
would actually hit the softbox which
will<00:01:43.200> demonstrate<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> video<00:01:43.979> coming<00:01:44.250> up

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
will demonstrate in the video coming up

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
will demonstrate in the video coming up
what<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> finished<00:01:47.130> image<00:01:47.399> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
what we have in the finished image is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910 
what we have in the finished image is
the<00:01:48.240> softbox<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.899> obviously<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> left<00:01:49.770> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the softbox is obviously to the left of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
the softbox is obviously to the left of
the<00:01:50.009> subject<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.299> actually<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the subject you can actually see the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560 
the subject you can actually see the
side<00:01:52.740> closest<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> softbox<00:01:53.969> is<00:01:54.240> well

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
side closest to the softbox is well

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080 
side closest to the softbox is well
exposed<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:56.009> side<00:01:56.219> furthest<00:01:56.790> from<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
exposed the side furthest from the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
exposed the side furthest from the
softbox<00:01:57.570> has<00:01:57.899> heavy<00:01:58.140> shadow<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.159> we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
softbox has heavy shadow this is what we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
softbox has heavy shadow this is what we
call<00:01:59.430> split<00:01:59.729> lighting<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:01.590> most<00:02:01.860> normal

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
call split lighting for most normal

image here the model is basically

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.120 
image here the model is basically
standing<00:02:48.900> immediately<00:02:49.379> in<00:02:49.739> front<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.040> the

as we can see from the finished image
here<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.730> lighting<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.329> very<00:02:57.390> flat<00:02:58.099> much

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
here the lighting is very flat much

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.559 
here the lighting is very flat much
better<00:02:59.370> than<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.670> first<00:02:59.700> image<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.239> we

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
better than the first image that we

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.490 
better than the first image that we
showed<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:02.519> again<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:03.269> little<00:03:03.720> flat<00:03:04.019> very

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
showed you but again a little flat very

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.410 
showed you but again a little flat very
much<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.890> using<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.310> pop-up<00:03:05.700> flash<00:03:05.849> on<00:03:06.299> your

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
much like using the pop-up flash on your

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.020 
much like using the pop-up flash on your
camera<00:03:07.099> it<00:03:08.099> doesn't<00:03:08.489> create<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.730> lot<00:03:08.910> of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
camera it doesn't create a lot of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.750 
camera it doesn't create a lot of
definition<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.780> contrast<00:03:10.349> no<00:03:11.040> contouring<00:03:11.640> of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
definition and contrast no contouring of

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.110 
definition and contrast no contouring of
the<00:03:11.879> light<00:03:12.120> but<00:03:13.019> again<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:14.280> okay<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:14.910> not

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the light but again it's okay it's not

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.449 
the light but again it's okay it's not
bad<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:15.900> we'll<00:03:16.470> show<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.860> next<00:03:16.950> setup<00:03:17.220> how

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
bad but we'll show in the next setup how

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.620 
bad but we'll show in the next setup how
it<00:03:17.879> could<00:03:18.030> even<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.329> much<00:03:18.540> better

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.440 

in<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.920> third<00:03:23.190> position<00:03:23.400> we<00:03:23.880> basically<00:03:24.240> have

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
in the third position we basically have

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.210 
in the third position we basically have
moved<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.810> softbox<00:03:25.350> between<00:03:25.860> our<00:03:26.010> first

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
moved the softbox between our first

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.700 
moved the softbox between our first
position<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.030> our<00:03:27.180> second<00:03:27.570> position<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.260> is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
position and our second position it is

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.750 
position and our second position it is
now<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> 45<00:03:29.880> degree<00:03:30.090> angle<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> subject

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
now on a 45 degree angle to the subject

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.750 
now on a 45 degree angle to the subject
again<00:03:33.110> somewhere<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.230> between<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.920> first<00:03:35.190> two

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
again somewhere in between the first two

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.350 
again somewhere in between the first two
setups<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.540> we'll<00:03:36.780> see<00:03:36.930> what<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.140> effect<00:03:37.410> is

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
setups and we'll see what the effect is

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.210 
setups and we'll see what the effect is
here<00:03:39.360> we<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.600> see<00:03:39.750> again<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.650> position<00:03:41.100> of

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
here we can see again the position of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.010 
here we can see again the position of
the<00:03:41.340> light<00:03:41.520> in<00:03:41.670> relation<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.270> model<00:03:42.630> it's

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
the light in relation to the model it's

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.650 
the light in relation to the model it's
not<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.920> far<00:03:44.280> side<00:03:44.580> at<00:03:44.790> 90<00:03:45.060> degrees<00:03:45.420> it's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
not to the far side at 90 degrees it's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.690 
not to the far side at 90 degrees it's
not<00:03:45.840> directly<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.410> front<00:03:46.710> it's<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> 45

of shadow on the far side which puts a

little definition into the face a very
pleasing<00:04:08.010> photo<00:04:08.460> if<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.630> were<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.050> operate<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
pleasing photo if you were to operate a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590 
pleasing photo if you were to operate a
studio<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.280> all<00:04:11.490> you<00:04:11.670> had<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:12.030> one<00:04:12.360> light

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
studio and all you had was one light

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.590 
studio and all you had was one light
this<00:04:13.290> would<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.620> an<00:04:14.070> acceptable<00:04:14.670> image<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
this would be an acceptable image the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.940 
this would be an acceptable image the
only<00:04:15.870> thing<00:04:16.020> I<00:04:16.110> might<00:04:16.320> add<00:04:16.500> would<00:04:16.799> be<00:04:16.920> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
only thing I might add would be a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.250 
only thing I might add would be a
reflector<00:04:17.549> which<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.540> currently<00:04:18.780> did<00:04:19.080> not

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
reflector which is we currently did not

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.949 
reflector which is we currently did not
do<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:20.459> will<00:04:20.850> create<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.209> really<00:04:21.690> nice

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
do that it will create a really nice

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.680 
do that it will create a really nice
pleasing<00:04:22.500> image<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.010> just<00:04:23.490> simply<00:04:24.330> by<00:04:24.450> moving

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
pleasing image and just simply by moving

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.490 
pleasing image and just simply by moving
the<00:04:24.960> light<00:04:25.170> from<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.800> 90<00:04:26.550> degree<00:04:26.910> angle<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.900> 45

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
the light from a 90 degree angle to a 45

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.740 
the light from a 90 degree angle to a 45
degree<00:04:28.530> angle<00:04:29.180> creates<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.270> beautiful<00:04:30.420> effect

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.270 

so<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.810> put<00:04:33.990> all<00:04:34.140> three<00:04:34.350> images<00:04:34.470> together<00:04:34.920> so

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
so I put all three images together so

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.430 
so I put all three images together so
you<00:04:35.370> can<00:04:35.490> see<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.820> impact<00:04:36.120> number<00:04:36.570> one<00:04:36.840> again

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
you can see the impact number one again

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.660 
you can see the impact number one again
the<00:04:37.560> softbox<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.490> at<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.760> 90<00:04:39.120> degree<00:04:39.150> position

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
the softbox is at a 90 degree position

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.090 
the softbox is at a 90 degree position
not<00:04:41.670> something<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.240> would<00:04:42.450> use<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.840> studio

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
not something I would use in the studio

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.470 
not something I would use in the studio
most<00:04:44.100> people<00:04:44.400> would<00:04:44.580> not<00:04:44.730> use<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.150> in<00:04:45.390> the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
most people would not use this in the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.300 
most people would not use this in the
studio<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.080> would<00:04:46.290> not<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.500> an<00:04:46.770> acceptable

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
studio this would not be an acceptable

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.400 
studio this would not be an acceptable
image<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:48.390> if<00:04:48.840> you're<00:04:49.050> trying<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.290> do

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
image but if you're trying to do

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.840 
image but if you're trying to do
something<00:04:49.620> dramatic<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.370> playing<00:04:50.730> around

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
something dramatic and playing around

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.050 
something dramatic and playing around
with<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.090> camera<00:04:52.190> it<00:04:53.190> would<00:04:53.280> be<00:04:53.430> fine<00:04:53.640> but<00:04:53.910> it

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
with the camera it would be fine but it

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.190 
with the camera it would be fine but it
certainly<00:04:54.330> wouldn't<00:04:54.570> be<00:04:54.630> something<00:04:54.900> you

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
certainly wouldn't be something you

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.470 
certainly wouldn't be something you
would<00:04:55.320> love<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.800> photo<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.670> your<00:04:56.790> children<00:04:57.240> to

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
would love a photo of your children to

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.060 
would love a photo of your children to
look<00:04:57.630> like<00:04:57.840> this<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.230> what<00:04:58.440> we<00:04:58.560> call<00:04:58.710> split

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
look like this it's what we call split

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.170 
look like this it's what we call split

real contouring of the light so the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.220 
real contouring of the light so the
image<00:05:10.500> appears<00:05:11.310> very<00:05:11.580> flat<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.270> would<00:05:13.110> be

image appears very flat and would be

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.220 
image appears very flat and would be
comparable<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.800> using<00:05:14.280> your<00:05:14.400> on-camera<00:05:14.850> flash

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
comparable to using your on-camera flash

taking a picture of them it's okay but

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.770 
taking a picture of them it's okay but
it's<00:05:20.760> not<00:05:20.940> something<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.270> would<00:05:21.390> expect<00:05:21.720> from

it's not something you would expect from

you could use a reflector and you can

you could use a reflector and you can
