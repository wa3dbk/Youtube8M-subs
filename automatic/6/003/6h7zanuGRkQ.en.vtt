alphabet stamps so I'm Rick what I'm

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.310 
alphabet stamps so I'm Rick what I'm
going<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.890> do<00:02:03.010> I've<00:02:03.130> got<00:02:03.160> two<00:02:04.080> acrylic<00:02:05.080> blocks

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
going to do I've got two acrylic blocks

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
going to do I've got two acrylic blocks
and<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:06.790> going<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.390> mount<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.729> random

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and I'm going to mount a random

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.960 
and I'm going to mount a random
selection<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.990> letters<00:02:11.410> or<00:02:11.770> numbers<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.610> each

selection of letters or numbers on each

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.800 
selection of letters or numbers on each
block<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.340> I'm<00:02:15.700> probably<00:02:16.330> going<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.570> fast

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
block and I'm probably going to fast

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.270 
block and I'm probably going to fast
forward<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.170> up<00:02:17.320> for<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.890> then<00:02:17.950> fast

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
forward that up for you and then fast

00:02:18.280 --> 00:04:23.540 
forward that up for you and then fast
forward<00:02:18.370> up<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> process
