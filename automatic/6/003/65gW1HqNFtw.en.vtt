00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
right now and you kind of get a gauge of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
right now and you kind of get a gauge of
just<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:38.549> rare<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.000> stuff<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.659> really

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
just how rare this stuff is it is really

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.330 
just how rare this stuff is it is really
very<00:01:40.170> where<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> thought<00:01:40.740> elite<00:01:40.979> stuff<00:01:41.189> was

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
very where I thought elite stuff was

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.740 
very where I thought elite stuff was
coming<00:01:41.460> prayer<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> open<00:01:42.329> enough<00:01:42.630> sir

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
coming prayer and if you open enough sir

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.359 
coming prayer and if you open enough sir
pilots<00:01:43.110> you'll<00:01:43.229> eventually<00:01:43.409> get<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.950> but

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
pilots you'll eventually get this but

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.980 
pilots you'll eventually get this but
they<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.670> legendary<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.270> super<00:01:45.720> 8<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
they with legendary it's super 8 so I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
they with legendary it's super 8 so I
kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> wish<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.740> increase<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
kind of wish they would increase the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.859 
kind of wish they would increase the
odds<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.850> getting<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.240> stuff<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.600> more

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
odds of getting this stuff a little more

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.030 
odds of getting this stuff a little more
because<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.170> coming<00:01:49.409> towards<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> end<00:01:49.920> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
because it's coming towards the end of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.830 
because it's coming towards the end of
advanced<00:01:50.369> warfare<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> people<00:01:51.600> are

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
advanced warfare and not the people are

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.270 
advanced warfare and not the people are
playing<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.290> much<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:52.799> used<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.100> wear

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
playing it as much as they used to wear

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.710 
playing it as much as they used to wear
as<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.490> brand<00:01:53.759> new<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:53.909> there's<00:01:54.509> kind<00:01:54.689> of

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
as a brand new game there's kind of

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
as a brand new game there's kind of
coming<00:01:55.049> towards<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> end<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.680> course<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
coming towards the end of course the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.800 
coming towards the end of course the
black<00:01:56.250> ops<00:01:56.399> 3<00:01:56.579> hype<00:01:56.759> increase<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> base

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
black ops 3 hype increase and the base

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
black ops 3 hype increase and the base
is<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> come<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.649> gamescom<00:01:59.189> there's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
is going to come out in gamescom there's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.069 
is going to come out in gamescom there's
all<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.549> gameplay<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.390> advanced<00:02:00.689> warfare<00:02:00.990> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
all this gameplay so advanced warfare is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.480 
all this gameplay so advanced warfare is
definitely<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> slowing<00:02:02.009> down<00:02:02.009> little

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
definitely kind of slowing down little

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.039 
definitely kind of slowing down little
bit<00:02:02.610> towards<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> last<00:02:03.240> dlc<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:03.930> it'd

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
bit towards the last dlc so I think it'd

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.480 
bit towards the last dlc so I think it'd
be<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.290> cool<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.979> would<00:02:05.130> increase

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
be really cool if they would increase

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
be really cool if they would increase
the<00:02:05.670> odds<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> getting<00:02:06.030> something<00:02:06.450> /<00:02:06.689> new<00:02:06.810> gear

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the odds of getting something / new gear

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.910 
the odds of getting something / new gear
because<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.229> wanna<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.409> able<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.590> experience

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
because you wanna be able to experience

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
because you wanna be able to experience
it<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> feel<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.729> people<00:02:09.060> are<00:02:09.330> going

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it I feel like a lot of people are going

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.880 
it I feel like a lot of people are going
to<00:02:09.539> move<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.840> black<00:02:10.110> ops<00:02:10.259> 3<00:02:10.410> without<00:02:10.649> even

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to move on to black ops 3 without even

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.619 
to move on to black ops 3 without even
getting<00:02:11.069> any<00:02:11.489> legend<00:02:11.879> who<00:02:11.970> give<00:02:12.180> themselves<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
getting any legend who give themselves I

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.150 
getting any legend who give themselves I
feel<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.840> that'd<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.080> kind<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.379> waste<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.920> I

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
feel like that'd be kind of a waste so I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.140 
feel like that'd be kind of a waste so I
would<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.520> cool<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.790> they<00:02:15.000> could

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
would be really cool if they could

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
would be really cool if they could
increase<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> odds<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.110> getting<00:02:16.170> some

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
increase the odds of getting some

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.080 
increase the odds of getting some
measuring<00:02:16.980> gear<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> lot<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> people<00:02:17.790> could

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
measuring gear so a lot of people could

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.460 
measuring gear so a lot of people could
actually<00:02:18.210> see<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.320> be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
actually see what it's like it not be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.230 
actually see what it's like it not be
some<00:02:19.680> r<00:02:19.710> equal<00:02:20.010> gear<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.640> well<00:02:21.090> of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
some r equal gear to get as well of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.610 
some r equal gear to get as well of
course<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.600> kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.840> our<00:02:21.960> stuff<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.380> think

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
course that kind of our stuff I think

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.960 
course that kind of our stuff I think
it's<00:02:22.710> pretty<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> most<00:02:23.100> requested<00:02:23.520> stuff<00:02:23.760> in

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it's pretty the most requested stuff in

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.490 
it's pretty the most requested stuff in
the<00:02:24.060> game<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.390> helmet<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.870> beak<00:02:25.110> helmet

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the game that helmet that beak helmet

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.680
