which is soaked in net to a solution

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.840 
which is soaked in net to a solution
which<00:01:37.560> gives<00:01:37.830> them<00:01:37.950> most<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:38.280> their<00:01:38.400> nutrition

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
which gives them most of their nutrition

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.890 
which gives them most of their nutrition
we<00:01:38.970> also<00:01:39.120> add<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:40.700> larvae<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.730> other<00:01:42.030> insects

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
we also add in larvae of other insects

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.780 
we also add in larvae of other insects
