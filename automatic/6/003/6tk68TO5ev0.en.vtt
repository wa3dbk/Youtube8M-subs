00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.570
 ah 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.600
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.040
 online school video today 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.850
 I want to present and know all the 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.280
 taiwan to article 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.720
 of the taiwan of the treasury is equal looks 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.070
 with his bare branch he is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.170
 rather better than here right now what 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.850
 what's happening that is getting ready for 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
 winter arrives then it arrived 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.440
 left a lot of foliage in case some 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.150
 nothing really falls out of frost shape that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.730
 only superficial leaves are burned 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.620
 for that and that alone is well 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.090
 it's good to also leave good 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.870
 let invigorate 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.040
 to plants and trees is already 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.210
 it's been announced a long time ago 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.080
 facebook for those who are not friends with 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.340
 facebook I downloaded the little video the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.470
 article of 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.020
 the ficus taiwan is this is the first 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.350
 part the merger here in this video on 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.790
 this article I explain to you how the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.400
 merge first explaining what a 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.460
 'pisito' bonsai style has a date 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.900
 from very pretty very pretty from gandhi the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.220
 trunk that is of finados that this is 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.990
 what is the structure of the tree that what 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.390
 that is inside the trunk that is this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.610
 what do you see here 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.120
 it's a way of myrtle 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.040
 Here you see how the trees were 11 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.650
 commercial trees that went away 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.840
 merging 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.010
 with the set screw technique 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.180
 drill 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.220
 until you get a tree look 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.350
 only 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.270
 you can not show the interiors of 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.950
 the magazine already but as is mine 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.970
 it's not mine because I paid for it 's mine 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.310
 I wrote because I 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.530
 you see here we see the evolution of everything 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.450
 which is the first one is very important 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.160
 because being a fusion of many 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.860
 seedlings of eleven seedlings there are 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.850
 have very clearly the structure of the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.620
 placing the branches to give the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.420
 future design because that depends on 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.480
 that our tree is a medium tree 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.860
 I think it's a high quality tree 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.800
 in this case it is just 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 you see here and the plundered the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.260
 wired everything 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.700
 until arriving 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.180
 to the merger of this ficus are 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.100
 I think there were 19 pages there 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.390
 tell the cover 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.140
 two three four five six seven eight 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.970
 nine we improve are nine pages 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.540
 written more then cover back cover 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.670
 of the whole story 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.939
 I already had it in the store in the store 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 online school saint school again 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.769
 after mounting bar on line shopping 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.870
 bars the school store things in the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.189
 shop in having a part called 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.040
 digital library and there you can 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.269
 download the article from the fixed taiwan 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.670
 in case you want to make one this for 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.010
 supposedly a super cheap material of 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.480
 this was 11 trees for five euros 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.450
 each one by fixing the mathematics not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.859
 fail are 55 euros what came out the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.230
 whole tree then I invested a little 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.879
 more money from pot the wood was 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.799
 a dead wood the screws finally 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.500
 how much is a screw worth it? 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.030
 I took out because I had out there and that's it and 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.069
 it's done and it's done and you can get a 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.450
 tree as well as this one in a very 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.450
 simple the second part we are 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.939
 doing since it's going to be about a 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.129
 elbow that was made to leave the base 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.200
 totally flat take roots from a 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.120
 for why clear each tree as it is 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.680
 his father from his mother have roots 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.269
 very long, even if they do not have 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.950
 pivoting because they are produced from 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.419
 cuttings from to elbow I think it's that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.129
 although they do not have pivot but always 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.900
 they have some thick dominant root 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.300
 all that has been cut and has been taken 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.950
 to each tree 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.450
 a new n varies in the part that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 corresponds that is developing 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.890
 still but you can see and I'm going to 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.690
 explain also how the harassment was done 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.950
 for all the trees at the same time 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.990
 so there would be no failures later and 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.970
 final I will explain in the third part 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.840
 all the branch that is being 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.970
 tuning and it is getting more beautiful this 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.350
 tree is becoming a pot 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.900
 inside that is already a tree with a 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.819
 brutal potential so up here 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.249
 I have a beach and I do not like the community 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.289
 and here the video of the school of 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:18.729
 today's bonsai is very short just for 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.070
 that you know that in bonsai school 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.419
 online bar shop you have in the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.250
 lawful library of this article is worth 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.199
 only one euro with 99 downloads of clothes 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.910
 to undertake is super easy super pretty 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.840
 you can include them if you want printed 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.139
 to teach the article a little bit 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.550
 forget to subscribe to the channel and it's that 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.410
 way you support the channel and in that way 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.210
 when I upload a ticket from the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.259
 notification if you like the channel you 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.120
 you subscribe and that's how you get one 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.880
 notification and was the first to see it 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.349
 if you do not like the channel subscribe and so 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.050
 you get the notification of the video that 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.580
 you do not have to see and point you can also 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.539
 follow me on social networks in
