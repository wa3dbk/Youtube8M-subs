00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.630 
so again those guys when they jab if
they're<00:03:50.060> not<00:03:50.290> educated<00:03:51.290> properly<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.550> the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
they're not educated properly in the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.110 
they're not educated properly in the
sport

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
sport

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.700 
sport
yeah<00:03:53.360> what<00:03:53.780> they<00:03:53.900> do<00:03:53.960> is<00:03:54.230> they<00:03:54.290> got<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.560> bow

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
yeah what they do is they got the bow

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.230 
yeah what they do is they got the bow
and<00:03:54.830> arrow<00:03:54.980> effect<00:03:55.310> way<00:03:55.400> they<00:03:55.550> jab<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:56.090> they

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
and arrow effect way they jab and they

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.730 
and arrow effect way they jab and they
start<00:03:56.480> pair<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.020> right<00:03:57.230> hand<00:03:57.380> starts<00:03:57.560> to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
start pair that right hand starts to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.710 
start pair that right hand starts to
fade<00:03:57.950> away<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.490> they<00:03:59.030> leave<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.330> right<00:03:59.540> off

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
fade away so they leave this right off

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.060 
fade away so they leave this right off
and<00:03:59.960> that's<00:04:00.110> why<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.560> counter<00:04:00.860> without

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
and that's why I like to counter without

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.890 
and that's why I like to counter without
hope<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> guys<00:04:02.180> fading<00:04:02.630> back<00:04:03.880> right<00:04:04.900> there

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
hope so the guys fading back right there

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.930 
hope so the guys fading back right there
the<00:04:06.470> second<00:04:06.920> one<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.190> lot<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.490> guys<00:04:07.610> like<00:04:07.640> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
the second one a lot of guys like the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.610

as<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.000> can<00:04:21.090> see<00:04:21.680> they<00:04:22.680> catching<00:04:23.250> them<00:04:23.520> as

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
as you can see they catching them as

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
as you can see they catching them as
soon<00:04:23.760> as<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.940> hand<00:04:24.090> goes<00:04:24.210> down<00:04:24.240> they<00:04:24.540> get

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
soon as the hand goes down they get

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.760 
soon as the hand goes down they get
power<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.140> they<00:04:25.290> learn<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.620> keep<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
power this is they learn to keep the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.770 
power this is they learn to keep the
hands<00:04:26.100> up<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.910> now<00:04:27.060> they<00:04:27.240> looked<00:04:27.450> around<00:04:27.570> the

most already has up to three months
after<00:05:38.180> three<00:05:38.390> months<00:05:38.690> they<00:05:38.840> they<00:05:39.140> pretty<00:05:39.290> much

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
after three months they they pretty much

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.380 
after three months they they pretty much
have<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.680> conditioning<00:05:40.280> they<00:05:40.940> know<00:05:41.120> what<00:05:41.300> the

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
have the conditioning they know what the

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
punches there should be throwing

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.780 
punches there should be throwing
digitally<00:05:42.770> they<00:05:42.950> should<00:05:43.130> be<00:05:43.220> educating<00:05:43.700> the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
digitally they should be educating the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.910 
digitally they should be educating the
