00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.680
 the most important thing that we are still 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.100

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.770

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.690
 thank you again what happens that 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.170
 It's hard to get the words out after 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.369
 this beautiful moment that I just lived 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.799
 and I hope that very soon I am very 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.500
 well and you can thank him for a better 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.479
 way suddenly tightening them with a 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.040
 I embrace all the Olympians we have to 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.110
 be in debt to him for everything he 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.020
 did with the team and also so 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.299
 did with the selection and because about 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.100
 everything is a human being because if you 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.080
 need help because we have to support the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.750
 true that is unfortunate but in these 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.210
 situations where in truth people 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.000
 they need is not when they are already dead 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.880
 but when really right now what 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.899
 they need him then actually 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.899
 I would have to support him
