and to open it you turn this gear but it
won't<00:00:16.970> turn<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:18.199> you<00:00:19.100> take<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:19.730> piece<00:00:20.090> off

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
that out like this and then that will

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.840 
that out like this and then that will
allow<00:00:35.690> me<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:35.960> turn<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.680> gear<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.460> then<00:00:37.640> I'm

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
allow me to turn the gear and then I'm

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:48.310 
allow me to turn the gear and then I'm
up<00:00:38.000> me<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.829> I<00:00:39.980> have<00:00:40.310> this<00:00:41.500> slinky<00:00:47.320> power

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
up me and I have this slinky power

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.090 
up me and I have this slinky power
functions<00:00:48.920> are<00:00:49.130> real<00:00:49.280> control<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:53.750> little

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
functions are real control this little

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.389 
functions are real control this little
crane<00:00:55.100> type<00:00:56.030> thing

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:32.349 

a<00:00:59.500> NXT<00:01:00.500> motor<00:01:06.219> flashlight<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.170> Xbox<00:01:12.740> games<00:01:31.359> and

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
a NXT motor flashlight so Xbox games and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.129 
a NXT motor flashlight so Xbox games and
then<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:32.990> walk<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.469> you<00:01:33.709> close<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.969> door<00:01:35.209> turn

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
then to walk it you close the door turn

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.599 
then to walk it you close the door turn
the<00:01:36.200> gear<00:01:36.679> put<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:38.299> piece<00:01:38.659> back<00:01:38.689> in<00:01:39.289> and<00:01:39.609> put

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
the gear put this piece back in and put

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.699 
the gear put this piece back in and put
this<00:01:41.329> piece<00:01:42.229> back<00:01:42.759> in<00:01:43.759> place<00:01:43.999> then<00:01:44.569> the<00:01:44.899> door

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
this piece back in place then the door

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:52.110 
this piece back in place then the door
is<00:01:45.889> locked<00:01:46.099> and<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:47.479> gear<00:01:47.959> is<00:01:48.079> locked

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.960 

so<00:01:53.120> this<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.510> mechanism<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.820> is

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
so this is the mechanism and it is

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.520 
so this is the mechanism and it is
locked<00:01:56.650> because<00:01:57.650> this<00:01:58.310> red<00:01:58.700> piece<00:01:59.030> is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
locked because this red piece is

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.460 
locked because this red piece is
connected<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.770> door<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.960> into

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
connected to the door and it is into

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.180 
connected to the door and it is into
this<00:02:03.620> area<00:02:04.370> right<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:06.800> makes<00:02:07.010> it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
this area right here so it makes it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
this area right here so it makes it
locked<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:10.300> when<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.590> pull<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.830> piece<00:02:13.310> out

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
locked and when you pull this piece out

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.880 
locked and when you pull this piece out
it<00:02:15.080> unlocks<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.890> because<00:02:16.750> there<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.990> hole<00:02:18.530> in

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
it unlocks it because there is a hole in

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.030 
it unlocks it because there is a hole in
that<00:02:19.280> real<00:02:19.490> red<00:02:19.850> piece<00:02:20.090> right<00:02:20.300> there<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:21.040> then

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
that real red piece right there and then

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.330 
that real red piece right there and then
it<00:02:23.030> makes<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.690> locked<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:25.040> when<00:02:25.220> you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
it makes it locked and then when you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.280 
it makes it locked and then when you
pull<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.910> out<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:27.320> comes<00:02:27.380> out<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.610> hole

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
pull it out it comes out of the hole

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.640 
pull it out it comes out of the hole
like<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.550> then<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.940> makes<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.300> turn<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
like that so then it makes you turn the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.960 
like that so then it makes you turn the
gear<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.630> then<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.959> alocs<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.370> when<00:02:37.850> you

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
gear and then it alocs it and when you

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.910 
gear and then it alocs it and when you
turn<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.360> gear<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:38.900> comes<00:02:39.230> out<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.680> lock

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
turn the gear this comes out and to lock

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.350 
turn the gear this comes out and to lock
it<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.370> put<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.970> piece<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:45.470> turn<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.860> gear

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it you put this piece you turn the gear

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.100 
it you put this piece you turn the gear
flip<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.660> piece<00:02:47.930> back<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.490> peg<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.750> then

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
flip the piece back in the peg and then

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.970 
flip the piece back in the peg and then
put<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.709> blue<00:02:52.150> piece<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:54.440> then<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.830> would

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
put the blue piece on and then it would

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.420 
put the blue piece on and then it would
be<00:02:55.160> locked

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.489
