00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.980 

okay<00:00:03.980> let's<00:00:04.160> look<00:00:04.250> at<00:00:04.370> the<00:00:04.520> first<00:00:04.819> class<00:00:05.510> of

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
okay let's look at the first class of

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.160 
okay let's look at the first class of
postsynaptic<00:00:06.859> receptor<00:00:07.480> this<00:00:08.480> is<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:08.840> the

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
postsynaptic receptor this is the the

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.199 
postsynaptic receptor this is the the
class<00:00:09.410> that<00:00:09.740> actually<00:00:10.129> when<00:00:10.790> the

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209 
class that actually when the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.539 
class that actually when the
neurotransmitter<00:00:11.959> binds<00:00:12.289> to<00:00:12.680> it<00:00:12.830> this

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
neurotransmitter binds to it this

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.760 
neurotransmitter binds to it this
protein<00:00:14.299> structure<00:00:14.869> will<00:00:15.110> actually<00:00:15.379> change

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
protein structure will actually change

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.060 
protein structure will actually change
its<00:00:16.039> shape<00:00:16.340> in<00:00:16.640> such<00:00:16.699> a<00:00:17.150> way<00:00:17.480> as<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:18.260> allow<00:00:18.740> for

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
its shape in such a way as to allow for

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.810 
its shape in such a way as to allow for
an<00:00:19.310> ion<00:00:19.790> to<00:00:20.540> go<00:00:20.690> across<00:00:20.990> so<00:00:21.860> here<00:00:22.430> we<00:00:22.550> have<00:00:22.670> our

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
an ion to go across so here we have our

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.700 
an ion to go across so here we have our
neurotransmitter<00:00:23.630> which<00:00:24.170> has<00:00:24.320> just<00:00:24.560> been
