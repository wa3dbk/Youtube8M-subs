I<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:34.020> talked<00:01:34.229> about<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.650> shorter<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I have talked about a little shorter a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
I have talked about a little shorter a
couple<00:01:35.460> clicks<00:01:35.700> make<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.420> taller

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
couple clicks make them a little taller

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.380 
couple clicks make them a little taller
I<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.680> make<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> little<00:01:38.250> heavier<00:01:39.000> or

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
