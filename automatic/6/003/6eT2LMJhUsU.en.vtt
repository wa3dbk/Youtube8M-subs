00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.950
 when they asked us to tell you about 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.450
 we got stuck for a moment 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.279
 that's because we like doing things 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:36.260
 don't talk about it we could be a foundry 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.260
 say but we prefer to let you see it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.590
 this is the production of pipes in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.630
 centrifuged steel is poured into metal 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.400
 in a rotating shell the force 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.140
 centrifuge pushes the metal onto the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.440
 shell walls once 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.440
 when the metal has cooled, the tube is extracted 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 to watch 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.060
 the doubts when cooled come 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.060
 finished according to requirements 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.010
 this instead is the forming we start from 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.200
 a wooden model placed inside 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.150
 two frames inside the frames comes 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.340
 poured of the mixed resin sand into 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.470
 so as to make it harden and take the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.420
 shape of the model within the soul 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.420
 thus the molten metal is poured 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.190
 the mergers thus obtained come 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.560
 then extracted are know 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.670
 cleaned of smudges and treated like 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.670
 requested in our customers 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.410
 at the end of the procedure the pieces 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.569
 are subjected to a series of 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.860
 quality controls attesting the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.860
 perfect success of the pieces 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.200
 it's hard work that's why we do it 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.200
 us with strength and compassion 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.949
