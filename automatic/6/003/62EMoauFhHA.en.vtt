00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the removal process is a razor blade

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.209 
the removal process is a razor blade
knife<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.300> we<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.540> for<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.960> application

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
knife and we use for this application

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.030 
knife and we use for this application
the<00:00:50.219> base<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.820> our<00:00:51.030> deluxe<00:00:51.540> tire<00:00:51.960> tool<00:00:52.290> so<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
the base of our deluxe tire tool so that

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.600 
the base of our deluxe tire tool so that
we<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.700> position<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.840> rim<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.800> top<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
we can position the rim on top of it and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420 
we can position the rim on top of it and
keep<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.600> turning<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.590> rotating<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
keep it from turning and rotating so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
keep it from turning and rotating so
that<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.940> safely<00:01:00.180> work<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.809> our<00:01:00.989> razor

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that we can safely work with our razor

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
that we can safely work with our razor
blade<00:01:01.829> knife<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.510> insert<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:06.350> bolt

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
blade knife so we insert the bolt

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.700 
blade knife so we insert the bolt
through<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.190> center<00:01:08.789> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> wheel<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.710> we

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
through the center of the wheel and we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.779 
through the center of the wheel and we
start<00:01:11.039> off<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:12.289> cutting<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:14.100> wheel<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
start off by cutting the wheel this

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.600 
start off by cutting the wheel this
would<00:01:15.539> be<00:01:15.690> your<00:01:15.869> old<00:01:16.050> tire<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.709> in<00:01:17.250> order<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
would be your old tire and in order to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
would be your old tire and in order to
remove<00:01:17.940> it<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.569> easiest<00:01:18.899> way<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.619> cut

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
remove it the easiest way is to cut

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.600 
remove it the easiest way is to cut
along<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.390> circumference<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
along the circumference yeah of this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
along the circumference yeah of this
wheel<00:01:23.789> yeah<00:01:24.479> what's<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.750> razor<00:01:25.050> blade<00:01:25.349> knife

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
wheel yeah what's your razor blade knife

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
wheel yeah what's your razor blade knife
so<00:01:26.160> we'll<00:01:26.429> cut<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> cut<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so we'll cut into it and if you cut a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.690 
so we'll cut into it and if you cut a
little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.500> into<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:30.560> foam<00:01:31.560> insert<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
little bit into the foam insert it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
little bit into the foam insert it
really<00:01:33.090> doesn't<00:01:33.450> harm<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.080> don't<00:01:34.470> make

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
really doesn't harm it but don't make

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
really doesn't harm it but don't make
the<00:01:35.099> blade<00:01:35.340> too<00:01:35.580> long<00:01:35.819> just<00:01:36.509> enough<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.140> get

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the blade too long just enough to get

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
the blade too long just enough to get
through<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.069> it<00:01:38.220> higher<00:01:38.399> so<00:01:38.700> we'll<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.569> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
through with it higher so we'll do this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.779 
through with it higher so we'll do this
and<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.200> around<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.740> outside<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.580> tire

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
and get around the outside of the tire

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.359 
and get around the outside of the tire
and<00:01:42.319> slowly<00:01:43.490> peel<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:44.849> I<00:01:45.619> am<00:01:46.619> careful<00:01:47.099> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and slowly peel it off I am careful to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.270 
and slowly peel it off I am careful to
keep<00:01:47.550> your<00:01:47.729> hand<00:01:47.940> away<00:01:48.119> from<00:01:48.599> your<00:01:49.470> razor

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
keep your hand away from your razor

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.529 
keep your hand away from your razor
blade<00:01:50.459> knife<00:01:54.349> okay<00:01:55.349> so<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.429> we<00:01:56.489> split<00:01:57.330> our

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
blade knife okay so now we split our

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.940 
blade knife okay so now we split our
tire<00:01:57.989> in<00:01:58.410> half<00:01:58.739> and<00:01:59.929> we<00:02:00.929> probably<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.590> just

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
tire in half and we probably can just

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.999 
tire in half and we probably can just
remove<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.970> pair<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.929> pliers<00:02:04.289> like<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
remove it with a pair of pliers like a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.729 
remove it with a pair of pliers like a
channel<00:02:05.369> lock<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.819> this<00:02:05.970> case<00:02:06.270> grab<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.440> and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
channel lock in this case grab it and

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:21.250 
channel lock in this case grab it and
pull<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> over<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.179> edge<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:10.400> peel<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.550> off

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.809 

so<00:02:21.890> we<00:02:22.010> take<00:02:22.220> our<00:02:22.400> insert<00:02:22.819> out

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.390 

and<00:02:28.939> then<00:02:29.719> it's<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.319> breeze<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.860> take<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.189> rest

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
and then it's a breeze to take the rest

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.199 
and then it's a breeze to take the rest
of<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.670> off<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:33.459> just<00:02:34.459> two<00:02:34.670> small<00:02:34.969> pieces

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
of it off because just two small pieces

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.080 
of it off because just two small pieces
and<00:02:36.670> we<00:02:37.670> are<00:02:37.819> ready<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:40.310> operation<00:02:40.670> to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
and we are ready for the operation to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.090 
and we are ready for the operation to
install<00:02:41.599> our<00:02:41.959> new<00:02:42.250> tires<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.700> insert
