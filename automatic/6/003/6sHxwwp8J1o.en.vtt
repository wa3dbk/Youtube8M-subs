00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.620
 I think they are all 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.650
 the jacksons 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.539
 sporting 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:09.969
 toxo to her 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.209
 in the first row the future versus his mistake 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.559
 Hospital 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.949
 the clicker capusotto and its videos 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.949
 the 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.489
 I think that 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.489
 what is nocturnality and night where 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.080
 more than where 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 they always had to do with my poetry 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 linked 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 I hated the night 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.540
 where lopez accommodates register to resentments 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.520
 or the darker feelings 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490
 Friday as lupus 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.550
 there is a cultural center that took the nocturnal cars of the muses 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.650
 it joins it so music and poetry 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.650
 autumn, sunset journey 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.870
 and it was a year in poster an agreement came 14 people 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.900
 and there it is going to be 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.910
 I realized that it is because of the dark fundos and that few can reach that 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.170
 darkness 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.900
 and then I said to myself 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.000
 what inverse sense is somehow to illuminate 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.780
 Poetics to reach more people is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.350
 shiva watch 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.930
 of poetics 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.300
 and move it to the masses 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 and grandparents 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.640
 a best buy 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.590
 Likewise 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.590
 yes i knew 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 the North Korean missile 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.149
 I'm asshole that guy 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.149
 represented throughout this year 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.169
 November havana 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.519
 workers but already big 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.119
 the service of the nasa 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.229
 Daylight Saving Time 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.119
 advances without brake to the law 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.119
 he starts dancing 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.939
 you have to have the political leadership of that era 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:08.419
 that said cruel murderous hours of your time as wild rajoy 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.939
 monsters 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.150
 of your days are fed 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
 it is death suppan 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.849
 this basically I think it's dark but somehow 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.349
 beyond those of the upp put symbology 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.529
 that's what it obviously has as a 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.529
 difficult visualization 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.339
 to provide something else for example 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.769
 your sister came to dinner 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.919
 and even if you do not invite me, I want to 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.249
 poster those 2 upi text 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.249
 then clearly meters where they are made 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 of poetry my poetry was beginning to arrive 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.209
 a lot of people 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.909
 cast 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.379
 I felt like he freed me 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.930
 maybe luque had already given his health that I dedicated myself that I owe to him 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.069
 - reciprocally 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.639
 and there can not dizzy his beloved give love to this hen 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.139
 that sold 14 million copies I experimented with the but sabah when 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.919
 I wrote a novel summer vacation is 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.349
 translated 50 languages 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.349
 and then a movie like meat moon landing 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.740
 there were plays like do not fool me that there is tongo someone revolviese 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.460
 Tripe 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.160
 and of course all this I owe to that cultural center as / 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.150
 it's good when I found out what they say 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.250
 they were going to compare and bankrupt in a bookstore in some way for a 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.539
 thanks for everything he gave me 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.069
 I bought it 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.069
 edition night spreading center that your hammocks of nobody 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.999
 where there is also somehow shows besides drinks 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.400
 uncertain exotic dances and I did it some way thinking 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.749
 in the imagination of a cabaret 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.770
 they also work girls 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.990

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.050

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.520
 ap sierro 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.930

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.059

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.059
 the winner 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.580
 it's worth nothing 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.129
 communism 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.210
 not even that 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.460

 the Cubans do not give 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.119
 Has no sense 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.150
 It seems to me that I know who 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.430
 I'm still with the maximum level of 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.029
