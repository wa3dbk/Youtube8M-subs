00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it quickly I do it on the side and then

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.950 
it quickly I do it on the side and then
on<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.890> side<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> you're<00:00:33.360> doing<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.750> really

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
on this side so you're doing it really

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590 
on this side so you're doing it really
from<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.829> top<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> nail<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:36.030> not

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
from the top of the nail down not

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.020 
from the top of the nail down not
underneath<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.170> nail<00:00:37.500> right<00:00:37.800> exactly<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
underneath the nail right exactly and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.889 
underneath the nail right exactly and
I've<00:00:39.750> discovered<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.590> trial<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.280> error<00:00:41.899> but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
I've discovered by trial and error but

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.310 
I've discovered by trial and error but
this<00:00:43.170> method<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.800> better<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.840> then<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.020> side

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
this method is better and then this side

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
this method is better and then this side
because<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.160> I've<00:00:47.280> taken<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.480> just

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
because when I've taken it and just

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.459 
because when I've taken it and just
holding<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.100> down<00:00:51.199> see<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
holding it down and down and down see I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.610 
holding it down and down and down see I
can't<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.160> doing<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:53.940> and
