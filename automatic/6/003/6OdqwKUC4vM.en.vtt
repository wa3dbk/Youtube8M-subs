00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.960
 the download ban it is a european one 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.200
 law that has entered into force 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.030
 Netherlands issued its ruling and frank 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 suddenly it is forbidden to watch movies and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 series download format and then 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.070
 I must honestly say on a certain 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.050
 way it was already what if you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.119
 uses torrent sites than ben 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.640
 to the valley but also to the uploading 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.519
 something that is illegal and I am very sorry 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.279
 I am afraid that the brain and foundation 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 those kind of figures now behind individual ones 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.250
 yes people engage that you get with you 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.690
 what you get a lake I crawl on a kind 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 of someone being convicted of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 certain of 200,000 euros because he 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 fucking game or downloaded france 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.350
 or something yes that kind of shit just get 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.980
 and I think it's really bad 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.559
 lex wanted to say I am not against it 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 it or i 'm not necessarily for that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.190
 download you know one it 's not that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.649
 it that i think everyone but all 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 be able to take seats without going for it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.149
 pay but yes let's be very honest 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.430
 essentially if I am now game or french 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.280
 officially we look and then i need one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 esbl subscribe to my upc you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 subscription i have i pay with all 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.880
 love for netflix and i want esbl 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 in exactly the same way and I find 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.940
 the problem that if users do not have the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.740
 have ability to content 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.970
 to download our world to like here 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.400
 they want that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.110
 Which 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.870
 yes then it will be downloaded illegally 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 and precisely because a spy is not one 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.470
 system that you can become a member and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.380
 everywhere that and everywhere i have my french 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.270
 can see but I have to do it via upc 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.910
 and then 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.050
 we don't want that because I am not like that 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.330
 fan of upc bills every month 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.500
 you hw i am the i but i become 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.660
 just little uncomfortable google 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.650
 fortunately it goes a base more 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.520
 i i i am i trusted the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.610
 copyright lobby really for no one 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.530
 meter what i said i am not necessarily 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.270
 sure everyone I have everything for free 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.900
 can rip and steal, and I know 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.640
 what 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.200
 that is not necessary at all but takes care 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.460
 just that a good system is true 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.649
 people can use it look 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.660
 my steam with you since team der is 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.310
 I am sure there is much less PC 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.650
 games are downloaded illegally deal 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.600
 that is 10 is great that you work it and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.760
 nobody really has any problems 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.140
 with paying for good content 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.760
 it's just it when people are forced 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.770
 to do something certain way 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 and it should not be otherwise and then suggested go 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.230
 in prison the got with blood and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.500
 laura then I just get whole 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.599
 easy from tick it guess it 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.580
 by god by min or ladder it would 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.640
 they can not put other 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.640
 You know this is the ruling bidder 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.190
 what are you going to do about it i think 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.780
 Copyright complex matter is where they are 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.900
 now we have to think carefully about how 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.519
 works well and not how early 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.630
 because I am there again today 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.819
 then well that becomes the new rules 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.200
 have to come 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.940
 and I am not in favor of it 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.739
 download that is not the thing you know 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.760
 I would like to pay for the things that 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.989
 watch you 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.750
 but I came her to a whole 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.769
 easy way to join my dance 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.870
 people think I don't listen 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.519
 I think all parties to march properly 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.530
 sit down at the table and very good 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.239
 solution 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.080
 going to happen what salt likes to see 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.900
 yes i am on the one hand i am not a fan 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.519
 because I'm afraid it's crazy 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.690
 things are going to happen all i don't 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.180
 suspect that things are going so well in the Netherlands 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.060
 will run only six in America that some 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.140
 users received absurdly high fines and 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.000
 those kind of things 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.620
 because i dont think you are a single 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.840
 user will but mainly from one 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.500
 few CDs that kind of absurdly high 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.090
 Fines 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.859
 must be able to give as in America 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.720
 once happened with a number at the time 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.799
 people who had done the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.170
 pirate bay 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.000
 at the same time yes downloading is illegal 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.100
 illegal 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.930
 so yes i get it too and 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.700
 actually not that much changes 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.019
 because most people use tollens 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.030
 that was already illegal because of you 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.130
 at the same time some are blowde so we 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.260
 that concerns the people who towers 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.359
 used were already in a legal brain 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 can do whatever they want utility 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.200
 is always faster and they never go better 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.489
 win that fight in the same way 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.989
 for download 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.359
 no one is afraid of it 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.459
 impossible to tackle anyone who 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.780
 turrets i download this is just not 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.340
 the route we have to go in and me 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.139
 believe but i think alot of it 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.490
 the people in games agree 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.350
 to be 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.820
 it is that chest upwards that the 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.700
 to get the money from this kind of shit 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.530
 but it's not the way it is 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.350
 thereby developing new platforms 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.539
 money can go to the developers 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.100
 because that's what I think about just being 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:42.100
 download everything in your life 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.960
 that actually makes products on goat 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.820
 with really nothing worth more you know 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.170
 it's nice to have something you go to 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.020
 looking out 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.670
 buy that you think ball or do you know about 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.960
 is mine you know a torrent or what 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.520
 it also is it is never mine you know 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.910
 it is something coming in and you 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.300
 looks flickering here again so no 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.400
 I 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.410
 download ban very nice all of them 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.410
 but don't mind
