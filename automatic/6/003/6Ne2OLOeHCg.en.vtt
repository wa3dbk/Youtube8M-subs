00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
need to do and we'll do it in a function

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.670 
need to do and we'll do it in a function
is<00:01:05.090> go<00:01:06.090> private<00:01:07.220> void<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:10.380> we'll<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
is go private void and then we'll just

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.270 
is go private void and then we'll just
say<00:01:10.860> store<00:01:11.869> new<00:01:12.869> player<00:01:14.210> info<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.159> what<00:01:17.159> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
will do is we're gonna store when we hit

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.390 
will do is we're gonna store when we hit
create<00:01:19.409> we'll<00:01:19.590> call<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.860> function<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
create we'll call this function and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
create we'll call this function and
we're<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> store<00:01:21.150> our<00:01:21.420> new<00:01:22.110> player

level<00:02:21.950> exactly<00:02:22.910> what<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:23.300> want<00:02:23.800> gonna<00:02:24.800> come<00:02:25.069> in

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
level exactly what we want gonna come in

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.229 
level exactly what we want gonna come in
here<00:02:27.940> gonna<00:02:28.940> race<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:30.970> change<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.120> to

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
here gonna race this change it to

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:40.270 
here gonna race this change it to
stamina<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.120> here<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.830> lot<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:39.950> copying

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
stamina go in here a lot of copying

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.140 
stamina go in here a lot of copying
pasting<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.000> coding<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:42.500> okay

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
pasting and coding but it's okay

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.080 
pasting and coding but it's okay
it's<00:02:44.150> good<00:02:44.330> practice<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:49.090> then

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it's good practice I think and then

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.770 
it's good practice I think and then
strength<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.810> then<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.830> think<00:02:52.600> since<00:02:53.600> we're

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
strength and then I think since we're

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
strength and then I think since we're
not<00:02:53.840> gonna<00:02:54.019> be<00:02:54.200> saving<00:02:54.470> our<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:57.500> next

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
not gonna be saving our in the next

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.559 
not gonna be saving our in the next
video<00:02:58.100> I'm<00:02:58.250> gonna<00:02:58.370> cover<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.730> serialization

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
video I'm gonna cover a serialization

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.500 
video I'm gonna cover a serialization
and<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.560> right<00:03:01.459> now<00:03:01.580> we're<00:03:01.760> not<00:03:01.790> saving<00:03:02.239> our

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and so right now we're not saving our

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.580 
and so right now we're not saving our
class<00:03:03.220> which<00:03:04.220> isn't<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.940> huge<00:03:05.090> problem<00:03:05.209> yet<00:03:05.870> but

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
class which isn't a huge problem yet but

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.930 
class which isn't a huge problem yet but
we<00:03:06.739> definitely<00:03:06.920> want<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.280> cover<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.519> because

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.840 
and go to press play instead of creating
a<00:05:57.050> new<00:05:57.169> character<00:05:57.380> I'm<00:05:57.830> gonna<00:05:58.010> hit<00:05:58.220> load<00:05:58.520> and

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
a new character I'm gonna hit load and

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.060 
a new character I'm gonna hit load and
you<00:05:59.630> can<00:05:59.780> see<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.229> loaded<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.740> character

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
you can see that it loaded a character

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.650 
you can see that it loaded a character
from<00:06:01.190> memory<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:01.760> that's<00:06:01.970> exactly<00:06:02.360> what

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
from memory and that's exactly what

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.800 
from memory and that's exactly what
saving<00:06:03.050> does<00:06:03.229> and<00:06:03.610> player<00:06:04.610> what<00:06:04.940> just<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:05.630> go

saving does and player what just to go

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.750 
saving does and player what just to go
over<00:06:06.110> just<00:06:06.410> to<00:06:06.919> let<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:07.220> guys<00:06:07.340> know<00:06:07.520> player

over just to let you guys know player

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.350 
over just to let you guys know player
press<00:06:08.090> is<00:06:08.330> good<00:06:08.630> for<00:06:09.530> very<00:06:09.800> simple<00:06:10.340> saves<00:06:10.640> for

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
press is good for very simple saves for

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.880 
press is good for very simple saves for
not<00:06:11.660> a<00:06:11.690> lot<00:06:11.870> of<00:06:11.900> information<00:06:12.200> but<00:06:12.500> when<00:06:12.800> you

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
not a lot of information but when you

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.130 
not a lot of information but when you
start<00:06:13.130> having<00:06:13.280> a<00:06:13.550> ton<00:06:13.790> of<00:06:13.820> information<00:06:14.180> you

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
start having a ton of information you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.780 
start having a ton of information you
need<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.320> start<00:06:15.590> looking<00:06:15.710> at<00:06:16.040> different<00:06:16.430> like

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
need to start looking at different like

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.100 
need to start looking at different like
other<00:06:16.970> options<00:06:17.479> and<00:06:17.660> saving<00:06:18.020> your

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
other options and saving your

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.200 
other options and saving your
information<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.010> look<00:06:19.220> at<00:06:19.340> serialization

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
information so look at serialization

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.870 
information so look at serialization
which<00:06:20.450> I'm<00:06:20.720> gonna<00:06:20.840> start<00:06:21.169> covering<00:06:21.729> in<00:06:22.729> the

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
which I'm gonna start covering in the

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.909 
which I'm gonna start covering in the
next<00:06:23.120> video<00:06:23.360> here's<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:23.750> script<00:06:23.990> so<00:06:24.229> here's<00:06:24.860> a

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
next video here's the script so here's a

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.590 
next video here's the script so here's a
script<00:06:25.190> that<00:06:25.250> kind<00:06:25.640> of<00:06:25.729> starts<00:06:25.940> covering<00:06:26.180> what

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
script that kind of starts covering what

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.510 
script that kind of starts covering what
we're<00:06:26.750> going<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:26.990> do<00:06:27.229> but<00:06:27.950> basically<00:06:28.280> we're

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
we're going to do but basically we're

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.159 
we're going to do but basically we're
gonna<00:06:28.610> start<00:06:28.910> converting<00:06:29.270> all<00:06:29.570> information

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
gonna start converting all information

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.050 
gonna start converting all information
into<00:06:30.650> a<00:06:30.950> binary<00:06:31.550> string<00:06:32.300> and<00:06:32.570> then<00:06:32.840> we're

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
into a binary string and then we're

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.510 
into a binary string and then we're
save<00:06:33.300> that<00:06:33.450> string<00:06:33.780> to<00:06:33.990> a<00:06:34.020> save<00:06:34.290> file<00:06:34.620> and<00:06:34.919> then

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
save that string to a save file and then

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.330 
save that string to a save file and then
access<00:06:35.880> that<00:06:36.060> save<00:06:36.360> file<00:06:36.770> but<00:06:37.770> for<00:06:37.950> now<00:06:38.040> I<00:06:38.070> just

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
access that save file but for now I just

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.129 
access that save file but for now I just
wanted<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.610> cover<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:39.120> basics<00:06:39.510> of<00:06:39.630> saving<00:06:40.020> and

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
wanted to cover the basics of saving and

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.470 
wanted to cover the basics of saving and
loading<00:06:40.320> under<00:06:40.650> player<00:06:40.950> preps<00:06:41.340> and<00:06:41.610> show<00:06:42.419> you

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
loading under player preps and show you

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.780 
loading under player preps and show you
that<00:06:43.020> we're<00:06:43.200> not<00:06:43.230> that<00:06:44.130> when<00:06:44.280> we<00:06:44.400> load<00:06:44.610> a<00:06:44.639> new

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
that we're not that when we load a new

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.620 
that we're not that when we load a new
scene<00:06:46.280> when<00:06:47.280> we<00:06:47.370> load<00:06:47.580> in<00:06:47.669> a<00:06:47.700> new<00:06:47.850> scene<00:06:48.090> we're

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
scene when we load in a new scene we're

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.600 
scene when we load in a new scene we're
loading<00:06:48.870> the<00:06:49.050> information<00:06:49.590> it's<00:06:49.889> our<00:06:50.310> game

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
loading the information it's our game

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.060 
loading the information it's our game
information<00:06:51.000> object<00:06:51.810> is<00:06:51.960> still<00:06:52.290> staying<00:06:52.590> with

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
information object is still staying with

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.970 
information object is still staying with
us<00:06:53.280> and<00:06:53.580> that's<00:06:54.360> because<00:06:54.780> of<00:06:54.930> this<00:06:55.080> do<00:06:55.800> not

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
us and that's because of this do not

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.409 
us and that's because of this do not
destroy<00:06:56.340> it<00:06:56.430> on<00:06:56.520> load<00:06:58.250> piece<00:06:59.250> of<00:06:59.400> code<00:06:59.610> so<00:07:00.389> I

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
destroy it on load piece of code so I

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.060 
destroy it on load piece of code so I
hope<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:00.900> wasn't<00:07:01.169> too<00:07:01.320> confusing<00:07:01.590> for<00:07:01.889> you

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
hope that wasn't too confusing for you

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.230 
hope that wasn't too confusing for you

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
go over it one more time of what we did

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.070 
go over it one more time of what we did
today<00:07:07.800> is<00:07:08.240> we<00:07:09.240> can<00:07:09.419> create<00:07:09.570> a<00:07:09.720> brand<00:07:09.900> new

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
today is we can create a brand new

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.440 
today is we can create a brand new
character<00:07:10.350> so<00:07:11.160> we're<00:07:11.280> gonna<00:07:11.370> say<00:07:11.580> a<00:07:11.880> Colin

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
character so we're gonna say a Colin

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.770 
character so we're gonna say a Colin
brand<00:07:12.750> icon<00:07:13.680> brand<00:07:13.950> new<00:07:14.100> he'll<00:07:15.060> be<00:07:15.210> a<00:07:15.240> mage<00:07:15.510> and

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
brand icon brand new he'll be a mage and

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.690 
brand icon brand new he'll be a mage and
when<00:07:15.960> I<00:07:15.990> hit<00:07:16.139> create<00:07:16.290> it<00:07:16.770> creates<00:07:17.460> the<00:07:17.669> new

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
when I hit create it creates the new

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.460 
when I hit create it creates the new
character<00:07:18.210> for<00:07:18.419> us<00:07:18.540> and<00:07:18.780> it<00:07:18.900> saves<00:07:19.169> all<00:07:19.410> the

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
character for us and it saves all the

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.330 
character for us and it saves all the
information<00:07:20.570> on<00:07:21.570> the<00:07:22.020> computer<00:07:22.139> when<00:07:23.100> I<00:07:23.160> hit

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 
information on the computer when I hit

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.969 
information on the computer when I hit
load<00:07:23.729> it's<00:07:24.240> gonna<00:07:24.389> we<00:07:24.690> change<00:07:25.020> to<00:07:25.560> a<00:07:25.590> different

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 
load it's gonna we change to a different

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.850 
load it's gonna we change to a different
scene<00:07:26.220> and<00:07:27.169> it's<00:07:28.169> going<00:07:28.350> to<00:07:28.410> load<00:07:28.620> that

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
scene and it's going to load that

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.210 
scene and it's going to load that
character<00:07:29.370> so<00:07:30.150> and<00:07:30.600> then<00:07:31.320> it<00:07:31.650> outputs<00:07:31.979> it<00:07:32.130> in

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
character so and then it outputs it in

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.620 
character so and then it outputs it in
the<00:07:32.280> console<00:07:32.639> so<00:07:32.760> we<00:07:32.880> loaded<00:07:33.210> the<00:07:33.300> brand-new

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630 
the console so we loaded the brand-new

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.469 
the console so we loaded the brand-new
character<00:07:34.100> it's<00:07:35.100> level<00:07:35.460> 112<00:07:35.970> all<00:07:36.150> the<00:07:36.270> stats

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 
character it's level 112 all the stats

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.029 
character it's level 112 all the stats
are<00:07:36.660> saying<00:07:36.870> exactly<00:07:37.020> what<00:07:37.350> we<00:07:37.590> wanted<00:07:37.860> so<00:07:37.919> we

are saying exactly what we wanted so we
know<00:07:38.400> we're<00:07:38.760> loading<00:07:39.000> it<00:07:39.240> and<00:07:40.190> that's<00:07:41.190> it<00:07:41.400> for

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
know we're loading it and that's it for

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.850 
know we're loading it and that's it for
today<00:07:41.850> in<00:07:42.690> the<00:07:42.840> next<00:07:42.960> video<00:07:43.289> like<00:07:43.410> I<00:07:43.500> said<00:07:43.710> I'm

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 
today in the next video like I said I'm
