 coach you are the soul of this club yes I know what 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.590
 the club opened quite recently literally 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.010
 a few months ago here it is impossible with 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.990
 zero 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.940
 to achieve such results tell 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.340
 a little bit of their past of their 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.490
 education about here's how you came to 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.960
 I myself was a gymnast I 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.640
 initially with Ukraine then when I 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.830
 was 20 years old we came to israel 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.560
 Of course I started in Israel 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.690
 career and there I had I worked in 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.860
 very strong club and there were of course 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.950
 stars then when we arrived at 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.280
 canada seven years ago i start i'll start here 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.900
 from this girl here is nikolai which is where 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.390
 was nine years old from here to train 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.810
 began to train and water trained 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.800
 give them canada and slowly appear 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.640
 new little stars and perspective 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.470
 I think we will get Canada high 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.450
 level let's talk a little bit 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.640
 Now that gives art 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.110
 gymnastics girls yes I understand that 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.970
 boys can't can't by this 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.860
 to do but nonetheless for girls 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.260
 how important is important for 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.510
 character formation whether for figures or 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.870
 that's what as a coach you consider this 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.790
 sport gives a girl I think it's 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.740
 the best sport for girls 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.710
 because since it develops 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.860
 rhythmic gymnastics does not develop 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.860
 no sport they become 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:14.510
 plastic dance flexible 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:18.020
 of course every girl she is individually 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:21.740
 but there are kids who go twice a day 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.460
 week there are who go for six days in 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.800
 week for 4 hours but in any case even 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.560
 those children who walk twice a week 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.650
 they are so changing they are so much 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.560
 turn from ugly ducks to swans 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.900
 that they become dance and 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.600
 graceful 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.570
 that's what our girls need 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.080
