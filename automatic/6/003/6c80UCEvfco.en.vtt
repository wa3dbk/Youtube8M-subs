00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.620
 we build the kitchen now it's the turn of the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.290
 living room 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.179
 if you have not seen the video before 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 video I left below in the description 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.160
 of the channel 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.020
 Give me a look, it's super cool. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 the living room and I consider more 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.039
 easy the kitchen 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.320
 this is due to the fact that we have many 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 objects in coals already almost ready for 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.710
 using for example a picture frame 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.260
 can turn a television or even a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.410
 super cool picture wooden boxes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 can turn furniture do not have boxes of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 wood, no problem 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.690
 use cardboard boxes and if they 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.690
 be ugly in covers with a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.270
 pretty paper a good alternative 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 interesting are pieces of fabric 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 I'm going to use for my sofa a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 a cut blouse 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.460
 already to do the decoration I got 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 plays a chess game 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 some pebbles and some other objects 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.570
 that were scattered around the house 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.729
 now it's just finish some 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.860
 adjustments here other there you will see 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.860
 cool and it will stay that state 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 as I said in the previous video all 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.190
 material used only shows 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.890
 of the myriad things we have 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.260
 home and sometimes members we realize 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.480
 but do not cling to them to make the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.970
 little house I did not buy at all 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.130
 nothing each can create its own 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.850
 house within what is available in 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.350
 House 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.350
 so use your imagination 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.730
 the amm 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.049
 and then you liked the result, do not 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.629
 same 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.790
