00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
clean and good it's down all the way

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
clean and good it's down all the way
tight<00:00:55.199> there's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> bypass<00:00:56.219> hose<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:56.699> here

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
tight there's a bypass hose right here

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.569 
tight there's a bypass hose right here
so<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> start<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
so when you start it up you're going to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.380 
so when you start it up you're going to
flip<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> switch<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.129> you're<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
flip the switch on and you're going to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.020 
flip the switch on and you're going to
bypass

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
bypass

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.690 
bypass
the<00:01:05.449> hose<00:01:05.690> you're<00:01:06.650> getting<00:01:07.220> all<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.490> air<00:01:07.670> out

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
the hose you're getting all the air out

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.830 
the hose you're getting all the air out
of<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.150> line<00:01:08.360> right<00:01:08.720> now<00:01:08.930> okay<00:01:10.570> once<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:11.690> have

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
of the line right now okay once you have

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.420 
of the line right now okay once you have
all<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.140> air<00:01:12.290> out<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.500> line<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.250> can

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
all the air out of line then you can

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.700 
all the air out of line then you can
flip<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:13.850> switch<00:01:14.000> up<00:01:14.330> right<00:01:14.540> here<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:14.960> it'll

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
flip this switch up right here and it'll

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.590 
flip this switch up right here and it'll
bypass<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.580> bypass<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.300> know<00:01:17.420> go<00:01:17.570> through

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
bypass the bypass you know go through

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600 
bypass the bypass you know go through
this<00:01:18.020> hose<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.979> your<00:01:19.010> paint<00:01:19.490> gun<00:01:21.400> this<00:01:22.400> the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
this hose to your paint gun this the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.890 
this hose to your paint gun this the
airless<00:01:23.390> has<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.770> smart<00:01:24.770> switch<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.660> when

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
airless has a smart switch so that when

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.190 
airless has a smart switch so that when
you're<00:01:27.200> pumping<00:01:27.740> paint<00:01:28.010> if<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.460> gets<00:01:28.610> too<00:01:28.820> low

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
you're pumping paint if it gets too low

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.680 
you're pumping paint if it gets too low
it'll<00:01:30.200> shut<00:01:30.560> itself<00:01:30.860> off<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:32.119> you're<00:01:32.600> not

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
it'll shut itself off so you're not

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.060 
it'll shut itself off so you're not
sucking<00:01:32.930> here<00:01:33.260> because<00:01:33.500> once<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.860> start

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
sucking here because once you start

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.490 
sucking here because once you start
sucking<00:01:34.430> air<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:34.820> your<00:01:34.970> airless<00:01:35.420> you're<00:01:36.290> going

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
sucking air in your airless you're going

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.550 
sucking air in your airless you're going
to<00:01:36.590> lose<00:01:36.890> pressure<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.640> your<00:01:38.210> spray<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.350> going

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
to lose pressure and your spray is going

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.310 
to lose pressure and your spray is going
to<00:01:39.619> finger<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.850> okay<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.140> do<00:01:42.259> is

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
to finger on you okay so I have to do is

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.920 
to finger on you okay so I have to do is
flip<00:01:42.530> flip<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.950> off<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:44.360> airless<00:01:44.780> is

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
flip flip that off that this airless is

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.680 
flip flip that off that this airless is
set<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.290> for<00:01:45.740> more<00:01:46.670> than<00:01:46.820> one<00:01:46.940> gun<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.509> use

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
set up for more than one gun you can use

with a power roller this is the pressure
right<00:01:52.550> here<00:01:52.850> which<00:01:53.780> I'll<00:01:53.930> turn<00:01:54.170> off<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:54.590> you

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
right here which I'll turn off so you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.370

small to very large you're using a very

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
large tip you can up the pressure if

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.680

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
to up the pressure a little bit because

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.539 
to up the pressure a little bit because
if<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.290> spray<00:02:12.830> with<00:02:13.010> too<00:02:13.130> low<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> pressure

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
right in the front right here when you

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.470 
right in the front right here when you
get<00:02:27.920> started<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.459> need<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.730> put<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.030> probably

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
get started you need to put in probably

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.630 
get started you need to put in probably
five<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.690> six<00:02:29.840> drops<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.410> oil<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:31.250> keep<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
five or six drops of oil to keep the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.600 
five or six drops of oil to keep the
hydraulic<00:02:32.600> shaft<00:02:32.930> lubed<00:02:33.890> well<00:02:34.220> because

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
hydraulic shaft lubed well because

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.160 
hydraulic shaft lubed well because
there's<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.820> seal<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.299> there<00:02:35.480> if<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.780> breaks<00:02:36.019> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
there's a seal in there if it breaks the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170 
there's a seal in there if it breaks the
seal<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:37.040> it'll<00:02:37.310> suck<00:02:37.519> air<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.060> not

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
seal then it'll suck air and it's not

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
seal then it'll suck air and it's not
going<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.360> give<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> pressure<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.110> you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
air out of line you switch it up and

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
air out of line you switch it up and
then<00:03:27.549> that's<00:03:27.790> giving<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.239> pressure<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.750> the
