00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
foundation thinking that it was just the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.670

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
foundation and it has to has to be

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.980 
foundation and it has to has to be
something<00:01:37.979> different<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.390> also<00:01:39.630> when<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> was

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
you guys to think that I don't like tell

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.750 
you guys to think that I don't like tell
the<00:05:50.690> truth<00:05:50.900> with<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.229> guys<00:05:51.410> because<00:05:51.800> I<00:05:52.160> want

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
the truth with you guys because I want

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.430 
the truth with you guys because I want
to<00:05:52.789> make<00:05:52.850> sure<00:05:52.970> that<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:53.690> tell<00:05:53.990> you<00:05:54.110> everything

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
to make sure that I tell you everything

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.469 
to make sure that I tell you everything
that's<00:05:54.530> going<00:05:54.830> on<00:05:55.039> because<00:05:55.700> you<00:05:56.300> know<00:05:56.419> you

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
that's going on because you know you

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.700 
that's going on because you know you
need<00:05:56.690> to<00:05:56.750> know<00:05:56.900> this<00:05:57.050> and<00:05:57.289> I<00:05:57.380> think<00:05:57.560> that<00:05:57.650> we

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
need to know this and I think that we

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.080 
need to know this and I think that we
can<00:05:57.830> all<00:05:57.890> recommend<00:05:58.430> products<00:05:58.789> to<00:05:58.970> one

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
can all recommend products to one

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.270 
can all recommend products to one
another<00:05:59.300> but<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.320> don't<00:06:00.500> really<00:06:00.620> know<00:06:00.890> until

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
another but you don't really know until

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.100 
another but you don't really know until
you<00:06:01.460> actually<00:06:01.669> try<00:06:02.150> it<00:06:02.210> out<00:06:02.390> for<00:06:02.539> yourself<00:06:02.600> I

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
you actually try it out for yourself I

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.170 
you actually try it out for yourself I
mean<00:06:03.289> I<00:06:03.410> products<00:06:04.039> like<00:06:04.190> I<00:06:04.310> shadows<00:06:04.789> and<00:06:04.940> stuff

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
mean I products like I shadows and stuff

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.090 
mean I products like I shadows and stuff
like<00:06:05.300> that<00:06:05.360> you<00:06:06.080> could<00:06:06.229> recommend<00:06:06.500> but<00:06:06.830> even

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
like that you could recommend but even

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.770 
like that you could recommend but even
so<00:06:07.310> even<00:06:07.520> with<00:06:07.789> that<00:06:08.000> sometimes<00:06:08.450> you<00:06:08.570> can't

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
so even with that sometimes you can't

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.570 
so even with that sometimes you can't
even<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:09.680> can't<00:06:09.890> even<00:06:10.039> recommend<00:06:10.490> that

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
even you can't even recommend that

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.040 
even you can't even recommend that
because<00:06:10.729> people<00:06:10.880> are<00:06:11.240> allergic<00:06:11.450> to<00:06:11.690> start<00:06:11.990> in

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
because people are allergic to start in

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.580 
because people are allergic to start in
the<00:06:12.169> scarrans<00:06:12.710> and<00:06:12.979> certain<00:06:13.310> eyeliners<00:06:14.270> and

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
the scarrans and certain eyeliners and

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.990 
the scarrans and certain eyeliners and
stuff<00:06:15.590> like<00:06:15.740> that<00:06:15.800> so<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:16.340> all<00:06:16.520> depends<00:06:16.880> on

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
stuff like that so it all depends on

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.550 
stuff like that so it all depends on
your<00:06:17.120> skin<00:06:17.479> it<00:06:17.510> all<00:06:17.810> depends<00:06:18.260> on<00:06:18.380> your

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
your skin it all depends on your

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.350 
your skin it all depends on your
sensitivity<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.580> what<00:06:19.820> you're<00:06:19.940> allergic<00:06:20.120> to

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
sensitivity and what you're allergic to

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.480 
sensitivity and what you're allergic to
when<00:06:20.720> you're<00:06:20.840> not<00:06:20.990> allergic<00:06:21.200> to<00:06:21.440> so<00:06:21.860> what

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
when you're not allergic to so what

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.250 
when you're not allergic to so what
something<00:06:22.850> might<00:06:23.210> work<00:06:23.419> for<00:06:23.450> someone<00:06:23.750> else<00:06:23.870> it

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
something might work for someone else it

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.170 
something might work for someone else it
might<00:06:24.380> not<00:06:24.500> work<00:06:24.560> for<00:06:24.890> another<00:06:24.950> person<00:06:25.340> so<00:06:25.940> I

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
might not work for another person so I

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.620 
might not work for another person so I
