00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
the third fret second string so we don't

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.819 
the third fret second string so we don't
need<00:01:23.659> actually<00:01:24.020> need<00:01:24.140> our<00:01:24.289> first<00:01:24.500> finger<00:01:24.799> here

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
need actually need our first finger here

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.330 
need actually need our first finger here
on<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.700> first<00:01:25.909> fret<00:01:26.149> it's<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.340> easy

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
on the on the first fret it's just easy

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.859 
on the on the first fret it's just easy
to<00:01:28.520> play<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:30.490> think<00:01:31.490> I'll<00:01:31.579> probably<00:01:31.869> well

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
to play that I think I'll probably well

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.569 
to play that I think I'll probably well
I'll<00:01:32.929> probably<00:01:33.049> interchange<00:01:33.799> those<00:01:34.039> so

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
I'll probably interchange those so

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.940 
I'll probably interchange those so
anyways<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:35.750> where<00:01:35.899> were<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.439> were<00:01:36.530> at<00:01:36.619> G
