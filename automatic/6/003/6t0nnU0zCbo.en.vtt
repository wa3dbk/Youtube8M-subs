00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
completely l3o what do you suppose the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.280 
completely l3o what do you suppose the
color<00:00:55.280> scheme<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.879> supposed<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.299> be<00:00:56.510> over<00:00:56.690> here

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
color scheme is supposed to be over here

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.070 
color scheme is supposed to be over here
it's<00:00:57.470> like<00:00:57.739> drab<00:00:58.189> drabber<00:00:58.970> and<00:00:59.390> drab<00:00:59.809> Oh

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.200 

they've<00:01:03.080> gone<00:01:03.290> into<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.680> office<00:01:04.159> now<00:01:04.369> but

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
they've gone into the office now but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.820 
they've gone into the office now but
maybe<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.659> reason<00:01:05.689> they're<00:01:06.200> always<00:01:06.380> giggling

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
maybe the reason they're always giggling

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.320 
maybe the reason they're always giggling
is<00:01:07.250> because<00:01:07.670> they<00:01:07.850> think<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.299> have

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
is because they think you have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.230 
is because they think you have
schizophrenia<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.680> yet<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.039> never<00:01:10.310> act<00:01:10.759> any

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
schizophrenia and yet you never act any

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.990 
schizophrenia and yet you never act any
differently<00:01:11.929> how<00:01:12.770> am<00:01:13.009> I<00:01:13.130> supposed<00:01:13.579> to<00:01:13.759> act

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
differently how am I supposed to act

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.349 
differently how am I supposed to act
like<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.590> combination<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.829> Ann<00:01:16.250> Coulter<00:01:16.820> Sarah

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
like a combination of Ann Coulter Sarah

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.569 
like a combination of Ann Coulter Sarah
Palin<00:01:17.929> and<00:01:18.229> Elizabeth<00:01:18.740> Hasselhoff<00:01:19.250> well<00:01:19.429> that

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
Palin and Elizabeth Hasselhoff well that

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.340 
Palin and Elizabeth Hasselhoff well that
doesn't<00:01:19.820> sound<00:01:20.119> like<00:01:20.289> schizophrenia<00:01:21.289> it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
doesn't sound like schizophrenia it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.039 
doesn't sound like schizophrenia it
sounds<00:01:21.770> like<00:01:21.890> The<00:01:22.039> Three<00:01:22.310> Stooges<00:01:23.049> exactly

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
sounds like The Three Stooges exactly

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.819 
sounds like The Three Stooges exactly
that<00:01:24.560> was<00:01:24.799> close<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:28.899> guess<00:01:29.899> I'm<00:01:30.079> having<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.499> hard

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
that was close I guess I'm having a hard

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.069 
that was close I guess I'm having a hard
time<00:01:30.920> getting<00:01:31.549> into<00:01:31.670> character<00:01:31.969> as<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.420> schizo

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
time getting into character as a schizo

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.039 
time getting into character as a schizo
a<00:01:33.289> being<00:01:33.679> so<00:01:34.009> beautiful<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:35.060> vivacious<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
a being so beautiful and vivacious and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.800 
a being so beautiful and vivacious and
all<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:37.189> very<00:01:37.460> hard<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:38.240> me<00:01:38.359> to<00:01:38.390> fake

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
all it's very hard for me to fake

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.010 
all it's very hard for me to fake
anything<00:01:39.590> less<00:01:39.939> but<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.090> think<00:01:41.539> if<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:41.780> had<00:01:41.990> a

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
anything less but I think if I had a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.410 
anything less but I think if I had a
really<00:01:42.590> good<00:01:42.799> director<00:01:42.950> he<00:01:43.759> could<00:01:43.999> bring<00:01:44.210> out

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
really good director he could bring out

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.940 
really good director he could bring out
my<00:01:44.689> darker<00:01:45.289> side

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
my darker side

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.450 
my darker side
you<00:01:46.069> mean<00:01:46.280> like<00:01:46.579> Tim<00:01:47.149> Burton<00:01:47.719> well<00:01:48.170> sure<00:01:48.590> but<00:01:49.189> I

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
you mean like Tim Burton well sure but I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.440 
you mean like Tim Burton well sure but I
think<00:01:49.850> you'd<00:01:50.299> work<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:52.490> treat<00:01:52.789> detention

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
think you'd work to to treat detention

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.899 
think you'd work to to treat detention
the<00:01:53.569> floors<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.380> sneak<00:01:54.679> up<00:01:54.859> and<00:01:54.920> surprise<00:01:55.130> them

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
the floors to sneak up and surprise them

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.859 
the floors to sneak up and surprise them
what<00:01:56.389> you<00:01:56.810> mean<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.049> this<00:01:57.530> no<00:01:58.539> well<00:01:59.539> what<00:01:59.749> if

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
very tough a real Svengali

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.800 
very tough a real Svengali
I've<00:02:16.890> never<00:02:17.310> been<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.910> country<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.630> I'm

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
I've never been to that country but I'm

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.860 
I've never been to that country but I'm
sure<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.440> very<00:02:19.560> beautiful<00:02:20.250> Bengali<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.599> not

a country honey it's a oh never mind
let's<00:02:25.500> get<00:02:25.739> started<00:02:26.340> I've<00:02:27.030> always<00:02:27.540> found<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
let's get started I've always found that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.839 
let's get started I've always found that
when<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> comes<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.680> catching<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.220> fly<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
when it comes to catching a fly the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.850 
when it comes to catching a fly the
direct<00:02:30.270> approach<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.840> much<00:02:31.050> more<00:02:31.380> effective

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
direct approach is much more effective

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.100 
direct approach is much more effective
if<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.520> simply<00:02:32.940> show<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.269> fly<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.959> you're

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
if you simply show the fly that you're

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.680 
if you simply show the fly that you're
actually<00:02:34.620> hunting<00:02:35.190> him<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.120> list<00:02:36.450> all

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
actually hunting him and then list all

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.540 
actually hunting him and then list all
the<00:02:36.930> reasons<00:02:36.959> why<00:02:37.560> he<00:02:37.680> has<00:02:37.830> no<00:02:38.069> reasonable

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
the reasons why he has no reasonable

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.670 
the reasons why he has no reasonable
chance<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:39.060> escaping<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.900> not<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.530> mention

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
chance of escaping you not to mention

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.320 
chance of escaping you not to mention
the<00:02:40.980> fact<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.310> his<00:02:41.519> life<00:02:41.700> span<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.180> rather

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
the fact that his life span is rather
