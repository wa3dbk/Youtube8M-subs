so<00:01:17.030> there's<00:01:17.299> eight<00:01:17.570> different<00:01:17.710> environments

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
so there's eight different environments

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.359 
so there's eight different environments
in<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.490> first<00:01:19.729> world<00:01:20.000> it's<00:01:20.719> mainly<00:01:20.960> about

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
in the first world it's mainly about

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.889 
in the first world it's mainly about
discovering<00:01:22.369> how<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:22.610> blow<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.539> bubble

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
and how to use the basic manipulations

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.389 
and how to use the basic manipulations
you<00:01:27.439> can<00:01:27.920> do<00:01:29.200> then<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.500> second<00:01:30.860> world<00:01:30.950> it's

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
these powers can turn counter them and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.690 
these powers can turn counter them and
maybe<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.290> some<00:02:51.470> cases<00:02:51.530> use<00:02:52.100> them<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.549> the

time in order to have fancy graphics we

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.210 
time in order to have fancy graphics we
had<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:10.010> really<00:03:10.609> push<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.510> hardware<00:03:11.959> as<00:03:12.889> hard

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
had to really push the hardware as hard

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.949 
had to really push the hardware as hard
as<00:03:13.370> we<00:03:13.489> could<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:14.209> order<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.540> get<00:03:14.690> everything

as we could in order to get everything

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.069 
as we could in order to get everything
in<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:16.280> was<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.760> constant<00:03:17.209> struggle<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.870> I

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
in this was a constant struggle and I

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.420 
in this was a constant struggle and I
was<00:03:18.230> afraid<00:03:18.530> during<00:03:18.829> development

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
was afraid during development

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.580 
was afraid during development
every<00:03:19.579> time<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.819> this<00:03:20.480> wall<00:03:20.959> sing<00:03:21.290> wouldn't

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
every time that this wall sing wouldn't

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.890 
every time that this wall sing wouldn't
fit<00:03:21.859> on<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:22.130> DS<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.910> was<00:03:23.180> kind<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.630> leap<00:03:23.870> of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
fit on the DS it was kind of a leap of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.710 
fit on the DS it was kind of a leap of
faith<00:03:24.019> just<00:03:24.500> even<00:03:24.980> start<00:03:25.340> doing<00:03:25.549> that<00:03:26.209> we

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
faith just even start doing that we

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.240 
faith just even start doing that we
didn't<00:03:27.019> know<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.349> would<00:03:27.500> even<00:03:27.890> fit

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
didn't know if it would even fit

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.750 
didn't know if it would even fit
and<00:03:28.460> we<00:03:28.820> had<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.150> constantly<00:03:29.900> fight<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
and we had to constantly fight and to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.210 
and we had to constantly fight and to
improve<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.990> frame<00:03:33.230> rate<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.590> improve<00:03:33.710> being
