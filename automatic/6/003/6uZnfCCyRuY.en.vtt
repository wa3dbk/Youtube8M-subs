00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.070
 welcome to 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.670
 faster track 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.670
 world superbike 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.020
 when we leave the dish here 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.930
 we are already at 280 300 kilometers per hour 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550
 with the superbike we arrive at the first 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.710
 variant and detached two hundred meters 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.599
 first left-right variant than in 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.960
 time has been changed a little softened 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.730
 to avoid road accidents 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.829
 we come to the curve to the right a curve 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.500
 impressively fast from the fifth 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.360
 march with the superbike we face it at 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.370
 240 kilometers per hour really is 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.860
 impressive the exit that takes you 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
 the variant at the end of the canal 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.210
 of the irrigation ditch a very left right 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.920
 tight with a lot of change of direction 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.179
 slow it is important to have a good one 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.879
 rideability of the bike 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.370
 and here we come to the two famous curves of 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.050
 lesmo the first one to the right faster with 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.899
 the front a little in crisis because yes 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.399
 brakes a lot for this curve 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.559
 acceleration second gear in climbing 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.360
 we arrive at the most important issue 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.340
 have a good line out and stay 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.380
 on the curb to take advantage of 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.150
 the acceleration of the bike and reach 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.550
 highest possible speeds since here 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.340
 we are around 300 here too 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.950
 under the old parable of Monza 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 Ascari arrive peeling and 150 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.299
 meters away three gears left entrance 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.829
 right very difficult to maintain the 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.240
 line here to face the last one 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.189
 left of the ascari variant that 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.630
 carry the straight one of the longest 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.689
 of the world superbike with that 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.119
 always main of the Monza circuit 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.189
 third fourth fifth gear there 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.530
 brings the curve to the parabolic more 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.049
 important of the circuit because it succeeded 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.549
 shoots you on the main slide yes 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.320
 widens a little in the middle of the curve 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.329
 there is a reference of a small street of the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.189
 commissioners to open the gas yes 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.750
 shrinks inward and fourth 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.000
 fifth sixth gear comes 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.200
 directly on the main straight 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200
 and this is a tour of monza
