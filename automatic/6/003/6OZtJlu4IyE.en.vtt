 Because of that youkai 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.930
 You have a healthy dream 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.290
 Koyama: I haven't been there recently, but I can't fall in love with my dream, I 'm in slow motion . 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.290
 The 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.870
 Oh, I had a dream of self- indulgence, but no matter how much I hit, the other party's no damage finally 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.540
 I've only seen a dream I 'm going to be bumbling 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:13.850
 I do not know why I do not you not me put my other party there were also hit, no matter how 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.850
 Mud and I want almost see this it 's not it's What Ya Ninen 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.950
 What about non 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.150
 In I, is not it was the eyes psychology part Akore Les university I'm kinda funny story 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:30.030
 There's kind of something that normally is not was a defense of the study if many of Te 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.030
 I think that there are people who died in something else 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.470
 Dreams and Martha who die and fall from heights that are strange in dreams 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.980
 There is a train ride and there is a death or an accident or death, so I think there are everyone 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.940
 There are days I never die from in dreams 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.690
 No Some also it's not is not a person 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.400
 Fall at the same time Mada minute almost dead Ko'iya maybe and almost die 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.909
 The people of the majority Nde I think to take place 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.409
 The world after death is probably not everyone can see, maybe the company has risen by evolution 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:02.769
 But it seems that there is a dissertation as to whether everyone sees what dreams are 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.769
 You 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.430
 In saying whether or not there was for what I something that also fundamentally begin with a dream I there 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.270
 If it happens, the theory that it is a preliminary practice to be able to cope when it happened in the real world is effective 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.890
 Something 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.090
 Seems to be 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.780
 yeah 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.100
 So in that dream, for example, you should not fall from a tall building 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.300
 Practice practicing in a dream with something like being scolded and dying or being scolded and judged and dying 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.699
 In fact , the probability of shock death when it happened is 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.110
 It is actually happening I'm reduced 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:40.300
 Probably one of the factors of happened is also a rehearsal of his wish because they experience in a dream, but say 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.300
 It seems to be able to endure not to be a welfare worker 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.070
 That's why it 's a dream building to protect myself in it, a dream to die 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.220
 I have had people say that the house I correct 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.720
 Every day I see the pain every day 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.840
 By looking at a dream that can be immune 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.550
 I actually die if I fall from height to some extent 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.980
 But just come to die falling from the degree of height where there is actual amount dream maybe in the middle are here 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.330
 Everyone who gets up 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.540
 Hmm 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.100
 so 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:21.270
 I 'm a guest I 'm percy Neko This neighborhood is probably a problem like an occupational disease one day 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:28.880
 I 'm a cooking boy who wants to become a leading role when given a stage, so I 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.880
 I hear it I summer Oraora Ora' to hear my story
