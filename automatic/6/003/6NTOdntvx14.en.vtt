00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.990
 was an jazz 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.290
 well we are in a tutorial of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.290
 Minecraft 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.510
 and it's a TNT cannon 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:31.430
 the cannon is not the idea is not mine 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.070
 nacho or mike to zaragoza would leave there 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.530
 for a corner or below the video 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 original 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.640
 Y 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.980
 original 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.980
 what he was doing was put here tnt 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.810
 and then we put here a cube of what 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.680
 want 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.680
 we give here 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.120
 and that 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.120
 6 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.339
 continue because it is modified and has 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.420
 operated 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.730
 well I was shooting the cube 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.940
 go to do 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.840
 will order this 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.840
 this was 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.600
 now always 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.270
 that will work 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.400
 and throws wood 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.400
 but I modified it a bit 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.860
 thrown out 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.810
 I was to visit 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.810
 if you understand to have you and 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 tnt I call you 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:57.830
 and now we are going to teach you how to build it 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.830
 the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 A hole 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:10.460
 of 8 8 x 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.460
 OK 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.020
 write, close 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 like that back to here 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.480
 and then we put a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.549
 a piston 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 Maybe not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.590
 here 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.069
 we put two cubes here 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.069
 two of wool for you we make day 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.239
 to see what else 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.290
 one two three four reston 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.840
 well more over here is cousin is a button 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.840
 it's outside 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.250
 and now I'm thinking it's going to come together 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.980
 with the other 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.099
 worth shit 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.099
 i 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.960
 but I'm looking at the other 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.140
 and I do not know why it's not being the same 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.440
 if this starts to be worth 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.400
 mother mother that they threw 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.400
 It is here is here 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.440
 is here 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.440
 repeaters to the maximum 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.150
 the other one of equal if I erase it all this 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.819
 then 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.280
 3 rector 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.569
 it's outside it's outside 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.079
 outside 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.079
 Y 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.180
 and then ex repeaters here to the maximum 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:26.520
 ok and this has to do 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:30.990
 cnt and piston mahle 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.370
 now we put as many other four 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.190
 repeaters to the minimum here we put 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.830
 here in play 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.830
 valued by the past 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.000
 we put text reston text 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.650
 here 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.650
 we put a repeater here 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.190
 to the maximum 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.680
 this does not stop 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.600
 around here and here and here and 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.260
 here 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.260
 A) Yes 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:25.760
 and now we load it 1 2 3 4 for 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.760
 develop with more power 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.889
 we give it and it works 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.360
 ok it has happened 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.690
 let's put here the heart there is not even 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.690
 trap or cardboard 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.520
 now we're going 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.790
 I think it 's good to see to see 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:07.870
 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.870
 I was like that already 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.069
 OK 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:22.260
 and now the operation is very easy 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.790
 pressing the button lights up 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.460
 reaction 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.940
 that activates the TNT 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.910
 was to see these repeaters go around here 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.300
 they go slower 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:38.060
 activate the piston 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.669
 and like these more faster and they have 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.030
 more circuits to do go around here 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:47.610
 active in this repeater 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.610
 that activates the tnt that was up 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.500
 and when lowering the piston the tnt stays 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.380
 and it goes off 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.190
 but you liked it 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.360
 the favorites 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.340
 comment that this appears and I will teach 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.100
 it's also from tÃ³nachi that I am 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.930
 modifying 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.930
 and good bye
