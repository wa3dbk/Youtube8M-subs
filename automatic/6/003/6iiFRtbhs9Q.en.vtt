00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.870
 These questions are over 1000 meters high 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.019
 and there are people in the world 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.459
 Such rocks like to climb high 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.639
 This wall is the most famous 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.379
 climbing route at all then they are out 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.289
 we are as horny as the wall is now 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.369
 by itself 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.050
 usually skilled climbers need 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.330
 three to five days for the ascent 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.810
 the huber brothers if it is in two hours 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.730
 and create 30 minutes 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 The record is rock-hard testing 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.880
 added 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.920
 a failure is excluded, however 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 If you fail energy should be like 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.680
 definitely not set up 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.140
 when mountaineering probably the fear until it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.000
 otherwise experienced somewhere else then 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 Just at the moment , one is so intense 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.470
 through this fear that we fear them 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 It has overcome that one has overcome 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.240
 Have a memorable moments in the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 life has fished it will never come back 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.630
 his partner against wesna thomas es 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 of course, so to do with it 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.129
 main bridge it with the freckles and 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.470
 the fear always before the whole thing 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.140
 the show then exactly in this 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.080
 moment out knew early gas gives and in 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.700
 rational you have them just as well 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.590
 better than the wish to stay 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.590
 5 4 3 2 1 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.700
 For some things in life you have to have one 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.780
 pay very high price 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.780
 You do not get them for free
