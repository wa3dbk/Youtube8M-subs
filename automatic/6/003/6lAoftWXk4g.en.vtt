right there it was easy being the what I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.900 
right there it was easy being the what I
was<00:01:03.950> trying<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.160> do<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.400> represent<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:14.290 
was trying to do is represent the
grown-up<00:01:05.270> wing<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.690> Democratic<00:01:05.720> Party

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.990 

it<00:01:15.140> was<00:01:15.260> interesting<00:01:15.500> because<00:01:15.800> Barack<00:01:16.640> was

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
it was interesting because Barack was

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.090 
it was interesting because Barack was
saying<00:01:17.300> in<00:01:17.750> essence<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.470> he's<00:01:18.620> campaigning

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
saying in essence that he's campaigning

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.190 
saying in essence that he's campaigning
against<00:01:19.430> both<00:01:19.610> Hilary<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.210> her<00:01:20.690> husband<00:01:21.080> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.660 
against both Hilary and her husband and
I<00:01:21.500> guess<00:01:21.680> there's<00:01:21.890> something<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.340> huh

made a funny joke and it was the true to
some<00:01:36.830> extent<00:01:37.190> but<00:01:37.760> I<00:01:38.830> do<00:01:39.830> i<00:01:40.010> do<00:01:40.280> think<00:01:40.700> there's

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
some extent but I do i do think there's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.600 
some extent but I do i do think there's
there's<00:01:41.450> something<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.960> seeing<00:01:42.230> people<00:01:42.710> petty

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
there's something to seeing people petty

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.250 
there's something to seeing people petty
bickering<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.240> think<00:01:44.510> there's<00:01:44.660> something<00:01:44.840> to

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
bickering I think there's something to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.780 
bickering I think there's something to
that<00:01:45.290> do<00:01:45.650> you<00:01:45.890> think<00:01:46.130> there's<00:01:46.310> getting<00:01:46.550> good

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
that do you think there's getting good

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.500 
that do you think there's getting good
from<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.180> or<00:01:47.300> not<00:01:47.330> what<00:01:48.200> good<00:01:48.470> now<00:01:49.090> no<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.120> just

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
from that or not what good now no I just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.510 
from that or not what good now no I just
I<00:01:50.630> think<00:01:51.020> they'd<00:01:51.410> actually<00:01:51.620> there<00:01:52.010> is<00:01:52.160> value

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
I think they'd actually there is value

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.820 
I think they'd actually there is value
in<00:01:52.730> having<00:01:53.360> real<00:01:53.690> engagement<00:01:54.050> on<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.470> issues

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
in having real engagement on the issues

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.170 
in having real engagement on the issues
I<00:01:54.950> think<00:01:54.980> that's<00:01:55.310> worth<00:01:55.490> something<00:01:55.730> because

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
I think that's worth something because

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.610 
I think that's worth something because
there<00:01:56.450> are<00:01:56.540> differences<00:01:57.020> between<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.410> three

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
there are differences between the three

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.840 
there are differences between the three
of<00:01:57.650> us<00:01:57.830> on<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> issues<00:01:58.340> or<00:01:58.460> people<00:01:58.700> need<00:01:58.820> to

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
of us on the issues or people need to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.940 
of us on the issues or people need to
know<00:01:58.970> those<00:01:59.210> differences<00:01:59.600> but<00:02:00.200> when<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.830> gets

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
know those differences but when it gets

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.890 
know those differences but when it gets
down<00:02:01.190> sort<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.550> in<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.790> ditch<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
down sort of in the ditch and it's a

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.330 
down sort of in the ditch and it's a
little<00:02:03.170> petty<00:02:03.500> stuff<00:02:03.740> I've<00:02:03.950> been<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.160> don't

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
little petty stuff I've been I don't

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.920 
little petty stuff I've been I don't
think<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.580> as<00:02:04.760> much<00:02:04.940> right<00:02:05.210> let's<00:02:05.570> see<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:05.870> a
