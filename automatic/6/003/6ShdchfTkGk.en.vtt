00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.340
 school world 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.350
 the place of stress the place also where you 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.990
 will hear very often then a little 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.559
 what do you want to do later 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.120
 later later when because in 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.800
 done right after I have something to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.050
 do I honestly come back to you how do you 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.090
 want to ask a 14 year old kid what 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.150
 will decide to do it later by him 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.100
 pokemon talk to him digimon by the iphone 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.720
 this is his radius but ask him for a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.909
 inquire about one's own future 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.559
 it does not make any sense you know in this 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.030
 age group there people they are all 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.100
 a little bit of alzheimer's from 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.080
 future Alzheimer future actually is 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.650
 to say that you can not catch 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.409
 matthew bly tomorrow we were shut up by 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.840
 example at 14 I play instead I 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.229
 played on pc I played outside no but 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.909
 Wait 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.100
 I also did something else 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.170
 that playing I happened to be serious 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.790
 sometimes I did my homework 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.960
 the only problem I had but in the end 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 of account is that I started from a 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.340
 very simple principle that cost me very 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.710
 dear to me school was for 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.750
 work and the house was for 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 play what can be logical a couple 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.740
 cheese in two takes into account in everything 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.810
 the world comes home in peace mistake 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.910
 fatal to the school path in celebration 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.530
 been a school failure and barely arrived 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.390
 in sixth I felt the reality 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.010
 ficulty of the school not because I in 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.810
 did I ever revise at home 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.850
 let go I knew people who 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.230
 had great notes and he revise 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.910
 not the house he was with me we play 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.500
 to the plain so logically I got 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.510
 said it looks tempting rotten fact 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.310
 such a fatal error number 2 must 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.690
 know the friends when a person does not 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.250
 do not overhaul the house and that this 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.570
 nobody there has good grades 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.030
 what you need to know is that this 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.590
 nobody listen in class there is no 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.730
 miracle now that it's clear 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.680
 me I 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.910
 it was not the only little brothel 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.290
 conflict that may exist between 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.060
 teachers and me although he loved me 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.130
 well finally the majority but even is good 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.590
 I liked a lot of laughs and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.560
 then I really laughed for everything and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 for nothing so death of laughing look at the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.810
 cutting evidence it's where the teacher 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.660
 so who says school says joke 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.140
 recreation when he knows all that is 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.210
 cute and it also says diploma exam 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.010
 whining comes home 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.410
 the first exam you'll go through 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.230
 schooling outside the bsr and the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.900
 swimming over 30 m this is the patent the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.330
 braun is the patent ok ok this is a 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.860
 degree and so on but I do not understand 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.520
 a thing here and there I speak to 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.350
 teachers why are you putting a 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.910
 pressure your students to believe that the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.800
 patent in fact we could work 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.360
 at nasa fbi and all that attention 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.040
 does not mean that we should not see it 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.300
 do what you want after and 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.340
 then the day of the exam 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.740
 we talk about that day the atmosphere 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.720
 glaucous it's all from a country or 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.520
 what for the little pride is your name 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 that will appear on the table you 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.410
 you feel like you're living 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:23.560
 stop next to her dropped in smash 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.760
 month borders bugs me my name is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.120
 laugh at these pages 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.010
 I leave our dreams of my father there and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.440
 as in May after someone between takes 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.330
 yeah a guard a supervisor she that 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.520
 as you want me I call that a sheriff 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.650
 that's good man what he has no 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.360
 gun no he is there now 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.040
 and pocket he puts his fingers in the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.750
 nose from time to time and I know I you 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 saw andrew the utility that kind of 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.590
 nobody is watching you all 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.209
 they just sit and they will 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.560
 look at what did not stop the 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.409
 majority of my entourage to cheat 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.879
 but when it was me who was rising to 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.650
 I can hardly believe 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.090
 that she a ticket on my head that he 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.769
 at all costs that I could not 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.390
 copy any letter the trick that is 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.920
 funny is that despite the fact that I 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.480
 did not realize all year long and well 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.069
 the day of the patent I left before 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.180
 everyone the day of the exams leave 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.019
 before the others it was something 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.209
 very glorious 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.250
 we looked manly three years later 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.629
 when looking for work had 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.109
 not look manly then the day of 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.760
 results 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.100
 to tell you the truth I have not even 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.989
 been know why because I was sure 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.880
 not to have it if you ask yourself 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.699
 why I talked about the patent and that 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.320
 I did not talk about the booth dub all 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.440
 other exams that may exist at 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.849
 university college a brief it's 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.849
 because in fact the patent is the only one 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.099
 review that I knew so marc tell you 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.840
 what you want insults month but even 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.520
 there and who likes to pass the friends 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.740
 did not underestimate the degrees the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.180
 exams because ok even when you make them 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.060
 sometimes it's hard to find 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.380
 work but when you do not have them you 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.330
 is going to pick mushrooms and you're going 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.830
 fish your fish i 'm careful 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.070
 we try to have them anyway 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.349
 especially not understand at work 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.479
 well you have an excuse there are some 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.340
 no excuses 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.409
 I do not know I'm not talking about me 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.729
 it seems that because I have not been 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.300
 see a maybe that I leave the patent 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.300
 I do not know
