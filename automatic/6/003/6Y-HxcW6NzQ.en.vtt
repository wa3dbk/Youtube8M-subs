this week on ignition we go to Italy to
find<00:00:04.440> out<00:00:04.620> what<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.040> do<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.430> Lamborghini

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
find out what you can do the Lamborghini

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:23.030 
find out what you can do the Lamborghini
in<00:00:06.089> 24<00:00:06.569> hours

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.470 

we're<00:00:24.040> at<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.189> Nardo<00:00:24.610> ring<00:00:24.640> which<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.270> one<00:00:25.419> of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
we're at the Nardo ring which is one of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.940 
we're at the Nardo ring which is one of
the<00:00:25.539> fastest<00:00:26.080> test<00:00:26.289> circuits<00:00:26.590> in<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.770> world

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
the fastest test circuits in the world

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.950 
the fastest test circuits in the world
and<00:00:27.250> we<00:00:27.520> happen<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:27.880> have<00:00:28.060> an<00:00:28.150> Aventador<00:00:28.509> which

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
and we happen to have an Aventador which

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120 
and we happen to have an Aventador which
is<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.230> fastest<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:29.890> most<00:00:29.919> powerful

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
is the fastest and most powerful

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.369 
is the fastest and most powerful
Lamborghini<00:00:30.939> ever<00:00:31.119> produced<00:00:31.480> we<00:00:32.140> only<00:00:32.230> have

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
Lamborghini ever produced we only have

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.290 
Lamborghini ever produced we only have
24<00:00:32.710> hours<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:32.949> drive<00:00:33.220> it<00:00:33.400> I<00:00:33.550> wonder<00:00:34.090> where<00:00:34.210> we

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
24 hours to drive it I wonder where we

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:44.939 
24 hours to drive it I wonder where we
should<00:00:34.330> start<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.350> fantastic<00:00:43.949> let's

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
should start that is fantastic let's

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.860 
should start that is fantastic let's
start<00:00:45.010> with<00:00:45.160> acceleration<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:46.510> here's<00:00:46.720> how

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
start with acceleration so here's how

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.299 
start with acceleration so here's how
you<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.079> an<00:00:47.289> acceleration<00:00:47.800> run<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:48.250> a

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
you do an acceleration run in a

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.520 
you do an acceleration run in a
Lamborghini<00:00:48.820> Aventador<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.079> course<00:00:50.350> on

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
Lamborghini Aventador so that course on

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.799 
Lamborghini Aventador so that course on
the<00:00:50.620> dash<00:00:50.800> here<00:00:51.210> toggle<00:00:52.210> stability<00:00:52.660> control

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
the dash here toggle stability control

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.260 
the dash here toggle stability control
so<00:00:53.110> it's<00:00:53.260> off<00:00:53.410> left<00:00:54.399> foot<00:00:54.489> on<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.670> brake<00:00:54.850> right

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
so it's off left foot on the brake right

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.150 
so it's off left foot on the brake right
foot<00:00:55.480> slams<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.870> gas<00:00:56.020> and<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.800> let<00:00:56.920> go<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.100> a

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
foot slams the gas and you let go with a

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.730 
foot slams the gas and you let go with a
break

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.560 

ships<00:01:01.740> are<00:01:02.040> fantastic<00:01:02.900> 60<00:01:03.900> 2.8<00:01:04.650> seconds

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
ships are fantastic 60 2.8 seconds

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.270 
ships are fantastic 60 2.8 seconds
it's<00:01:06.900> knock<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.530> back<00:01:07.710> the

the way to 217 but unfortunately

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.940 
the way to 217 but unfortunately
Lamborghini<00:01:19.080> won't<00:01:19.320> allow<00:01:19.500> us<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
Lamborghini won't allow us to do that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.420 
Lamborghini won't allow us to do that
