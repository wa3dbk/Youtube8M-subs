00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 it's almost not like that at all 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:15.719
 battlefield 3 no idea I did not 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.770
 on the brunner the ceiling you look 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.510
 you just get the floor 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.939
 the healthy but also had ideal 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.090
 I have to say the circumstances one says house 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.090
 down yes it is still exaggerated 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 Tip is only on and above 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.760
 we did not lose our own 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:59.899
 get statistics points is called ours 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 Team really sacrifice is the sensitivity 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:09.210
 geared so definitely can 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:11.540
 I shoot very precisely back there 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.540
 which there 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.290
 ally 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.950
 I have to do it now why 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.410
 make the 2 what was that like her 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.150
 a bomb no that with colleagues you 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.220
 I have to think that 3000 will come 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.490
 people ask, after all, killed 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.490
 Not 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 just shoot somewhere 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.550
 yes yes yes the purest whatever that means 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.470
 without a shirt without damn everything was 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.380
 almost who can not count that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.890
 We now have to withstand immediately release 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.780
 now you are one 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.620
 taliban group what is cutting now 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.330
 me at the taliban 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.510
 and I'm not what is that for 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.510
 a behavior is not a sniper 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.820
 everywhere and sad when you see it too 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.080
 already so daring with his beard 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.310
 the grandfather only in spite of pavin loud he is 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.510
 I think that is our best 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.990
 So if we kill something then with 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.700
 the Sun is just seen I take've 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.080
 I'm just two meters straight 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 running and then I would now and then 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.910
 the title has it but who directly 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 above all, now won 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.090
 not anymore 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.130
 we won you would have me that 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.709
 I changed the team did was 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.470
 it just pressed on the change that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.680
 it makes sense and immediately they were 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.670
 around 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.680
 to know for yourself with the grenade 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.430
 that now appeared that we made so 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:04.490
 wow ok where are the opponents we are the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:09.830
 because of heart this is not it will be it 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.500
 can almost kill one yes yes clearly 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.510
 again called on it I have taken is 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:22.880
 My next eighth one wants to be with the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.530
 Ax with the ax somehow always seen 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.060
 so the feeling so always the feeling 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.410
 but since then we have been five minutes 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.160
 I have the feeling of playing here 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.480
 totally play 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.750
 First, totally unfair second opponent 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.750
 China 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.130
 and thirdly, you have to take every shot 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:55.560
 killed her first shot right 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:58.220

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.220

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:14.370

 respect you that's true comes 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.910
 an alarm, a 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.500
 which sense does it mean now 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.360
 you have searched there immediately 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.340
 around the clock why I also have on it 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:33.900
 shot 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:36.820
 yes that is in the massai fucking ax like 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:49.800
 one another card believes the card looked 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:51.389
 yes I have with hop 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.129
 he has the same shit was willing and 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:59.340
 kills a new because you can do that 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.389
 use the previous one in which 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.699
 direction should I shoot at the 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:08.400
 mountains at the special ops seems to know 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.150
 the tank from Panzer or already broken 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.300
 his 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.300
 Super parade must be incredibly important 

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:23.589
 What is it that appreciates it here 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:25.270
 yes that 's okay that 's now it will be 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.089

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.610

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:47.830
 have met or mean smoke 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:49.349
 right now the game you have the 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.719
 kick 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.550
 why I would look to either 2 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.379
 I was or will continue to be so bad 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.270

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:13.080
 switch a server fireplace in green 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:07:00.360

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.900
 shot and I did not die 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.730
 I had what was that now 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.440
 worth 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.990
 this game is pretty funny so must 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.590
 that's the best price 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.590
 play at all
