00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.020 

okay<00:00:01.140> we're<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.410> Photoshop<00:00:01.920> cs4<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:02.970> I'm

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay we're in Photoshop cs4 here and I'm

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.930 
okay we're in Photoshop cs4 here and I'm
just<00:00:03.240> gonna<00:00:03.360> give<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> little<00:00:04.110> overview<00:00:04.470> on

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
just gonna give you a little overview on

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.250 
just gonna give you a little overview on
working<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:05.970> color<00:00:06.359> spaces<00:00:08.540> we'll<00:00:09.540> divide

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
working with color spaces we'll divide

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.860 
working with color spaces we'll divide
this<00:00:10.290> up<00:00:10.620> into<00:00:11.000> basically<00:00:12.000> three<00:00:12.389> primary

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
this up into basically three primary

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.290 
this up into basically three primary
color<00:00:13.139> spaces<00:00:13.710> prophoto<00:00:14.219> RGB<00:00:14.900> Adobe<00:00:15.900> RGB<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
color spaces prophoto RGB Adobe RGB and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
color spaces prophoto RGB Adobe RGB and
srgb<00:00:18.300> now<00:00:19.199> you'll<00:00:19.410> notice<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.920> visible

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
srgb now you'll notice that the visible

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.880 
srgb now you'll notice that the visible
spectrum<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.880> probably<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> large<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.680> long

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
spectrum is probably this large and long

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.300 
spectrum is probably this large and long
gated<00:00:23.369> space<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.900> Profoto<00:00:25.439> represents

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
gated space and so Profoto represents

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
gated space and so Profoto represents
our<00:00:26.430> largest<00:00:27.119> space<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.750> case<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
our largest space in this case in that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.560 
our largest space in this case in that
it<00:00:29.420> represents<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.689> triangle<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:32.570> Adobe

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it represents this triangle here Adobe

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.490 
it represents this triangle here Adobe
1998<00:00:34.430> RGB<00:00:35.430> represents<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.570> triangle<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
1998 RGB represents this triangle it's a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.209 
1998 RGB represents this triangle it's a
smaller<00:00:37.950> gamut<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> color<00:00:38.820> space<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.950> srgb<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
smaller gamut of color space and srgb is

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.080 
smaller gamut of color space and srgb is
the<00:00:41.850> smallest<00:00:42.360> being<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.590> here

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
the smallest being this one right here

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
the smallest being this one right here
okay<00:00:45.120> triangle<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.800> I've<00:00:47.340> got<00:00:47.550> an

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
okay triangle and then I've got an

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.630 
okay triangle and then I've got an
inkjet<00:00:48.059> matte<00:00:48.450> paper<00:00:49.190> output<00:00:50.190> profile

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
inkjet matte paper output profile

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
inkjet matte paper output profile
inserted<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.110> well<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.829> can

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
inserted in here as well so that we can

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
inserted in here as well so that we can
see<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.120> differences<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:54.870> they

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
see the differences in how they

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.639 
see the differences in how they
correspond<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.489> color<00:00:56.940> spaces

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
correspond to the different color spaces

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
correspond to the different color spaces
so<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> were<00:00:59.010> working<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.879> print

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so if we were working with them print

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.889 
so if we were working with them print
gamut<00:01:01.289> spaces<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.489> could<00:01:02.670> infer<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
gamut spaces what we could infer is that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.800 
gamut spaces what we could infer is that
Adobe<00:01:04.470> 1998<00:01:04.850> represents<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.060> triangle<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Adobe 1998 represents this triangle and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.850 
Adobe 1998 represents this triangle and
our<00:01:06.930> srgb<00:01:07.710> space<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.580> triangle<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:10.290> srgb

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
our srgb space is this triangle the srgb

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
our srgb space is this triangle the srgb
space<00:01:11.189> clips<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> green<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.479> them

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
space clips off the green and them

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
space clips off the green and them
science<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.439> blues<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.740> even<00:01:14.340> some

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
science and some blues and even some

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.330 
science and some blues and even some
yellows<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.119> some<00:01:15.450> Reds<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.740> compare

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
yellows and some Reds so if we compare

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.450 
yellows and some Reds so if we compare
the<00:01:17.520> two<00:01:17.810> notice<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> compression<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.009> color

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the two notice the compression of color

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.020 
the two notice the compression of color
gamut<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.450> though<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.960> call<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.850> if<00:01:23.850> we

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gamut as though as we call it now if we

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.780 
gamut as though as we call it now if we
were<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.840> Adobe<00:01:25.290> 1998<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.670> its

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
were to work with Adobe 1998 and see its

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.179 
were to work with Adobe 1998 and see its
relationship<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> matte<00:01:28.200> surface<00:01:28.229> printing

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
relationship to a matte surface printing
space<00:01:30.049> which<00:01:31.049> would<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> destination

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
space which would be the destination

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.690 
space which would be the destination
space<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> color<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> ink<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
space of the color of the ink and the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
paper substrate that it sits on we could

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.740 
paper substrate that it sits on we could
make<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> comparison<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.450> HP<00:01:42.450> 90

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
make a comparison and see that the HP 90

from<00:01:58.290> its<00:01:58.560> color<00:01:58.829> space<00:01:59.219> so<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.390> were

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
from its color space so if we were

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.959 
from its color space so if we were

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
what we would find is that we would lose

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.980 
what we would find is that we would lose
this<00:02:13.220> information<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.000> doesn't<00:02:14.300> fit<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.840> our

this information it doesn't fit in our

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.229 
surface papers there's an expanded color

those print spaces we have more

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.220 
those print spaces we have more

accurately<00:04:17.070> produced<00:04:17.610> image<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:19.470> this<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.860> a

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.590 
accurately produced image so this is a

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
space that's kind of what we kind of

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.930 
space that's kind of what we kind of
rely<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:21.959> for<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.920> high<00:04:23.220> quality<00:04:23.490> inkjet

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
