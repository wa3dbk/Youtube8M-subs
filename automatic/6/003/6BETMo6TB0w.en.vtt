00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.230 
patterns here have something to deal
with<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.470> i<00:01:59.500> know<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.800> whole<00:01:59.830> shoot<00:02:00.190> us<00:02:00.370> but<00:02:01.000> to

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
with it i know the whole shoot us but to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.700 
with it i know the whole shoot us but to
me<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.659> is<00:02:01.720> definitely<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.320> most<00:02:02.409> obvious

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710

this is the paw of the panther because

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.080 
this is the paw of the panther because
jordan<00:02:06.130> was<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.580> black<00:02:06.880> panther<00:02:08.280> um

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
carbon fiber along here let's get you

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.080 
carbon fiber along here let's get you
like<00:02:14.810> white<00:02:15.049> polka<00:02:15.680> dots<00:02:15.799> it's<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.579> nice<00:02:16.670> carbon

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
like white polka dots it's a nice carbon

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.660 
like white polka dots it's a nice carbon
fiber<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.739> carbon<00:02:19.129> fiber<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.489> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
fiber I like the carbon fiber on the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.350 
fiber I like the carbon fiber on the
phone<00:02:19.819> posits<00:02:20.000> better<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:20.989> that's<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:21.409> me

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
phone posits better but that's just me

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
hologram came with the plastic cover

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.759 
hologram came with the plastic cover
over<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.230> took<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.500> off<00:03:16.510> if<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:18.410> case<00:03:18.590> may<00:03:18.739> be

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
over I took it off if the case may be

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.789 
over I took it off if the case may be
that<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.549> over<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> next<00:03:20.269> few<00:03:20.510> years<00:03:20.799> gets

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
that this over the next few years gets

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
clouded up I know how to get rid of it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.930 
clouded up I know how to get rid of it
most<00:03:23.329> you<00:03:23.510> probably<00:03:23.780> do<00:03:23.900> too<00:03:24.849> moving<00:03:25.849> on

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
most you probably do too moving on

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
with this I thought it would be like a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.280 
with this I thought it would be like a
crappy<00:03:32.030> kind<00:03:32.359> of<00:03:32.449> leather<00:03:32.599> but<00:03:32.840> it's<00:03:32.959> not<00:03:33.139> it's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
like a soft nice leather and here you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.360 
like a soft nice leather and here you
got<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.519> really<00:03:37.760> nice<00:03:37.940> soft<00:03:38.359> tumbled<00:03:38.870> leather

got a really nice soft tumbled leather

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.000 
got a really nice soft tumbled leather
it's<00:03:40.370> actually<00:03:40.639> really<00:03:40.849> really<00:03:41.299> nice<00:03:42.010> better

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
it's actually really really nice better

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.520 
it's actually really really nice better
than<00:03:43.069> I<00:03:43.250> expected<00:03:43.400> definitely<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.349> side

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
than I expected definitely on the side

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.509 
than I expected definitely on the side
you<00:03:45.709> also<00:03:45.949> have<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.190> nice<00:03:46.940> tumbled<00:03:47.810> leather

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.390 

quality<00:03:52.519> issues<00:03:53.290> like<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.409> said<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:55.190> leather

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
quality issues like I said the leather

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.979 
quality issues like I said the leather
and<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:55.879> this<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.329> suede<00:03:56.599> or<00:03:56.750> nubuck

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
and then this like suede or nubuck

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.020 
and then this like suede or nubuck
whatever<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:58.010> think<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:58.639> more<00:03:58.699> of<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:58.909> new
