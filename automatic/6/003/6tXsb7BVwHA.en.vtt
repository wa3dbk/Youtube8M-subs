00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.750
 only two girls are bear trap and 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.600
 welcome back this new video always here 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.400
 looks like the sub 2 caps now become 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.180
 symptom of my mental illness say 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.189
 bla caps so excluded we are here today 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.750
 with gameplay 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.470
 I did a while ago that I was 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 forgotten deep in my record 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.270
 stiff but not bad at all 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.230
 let's say this is my second nuclear 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.810
 discar is mine 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.960
 nuclear the scarce standoffs I would have one 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.700
 another jump on aftermath I know I would have 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.040
 I also preferred to watch the upload 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.810
 core software but because we say that the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.920
 map that you don't often see a map 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.520
 not easy though that nuclear really in 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.590
 loadable in my opinion for who he is is of 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.220
 pieces are exasperating slowness 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.210
 in which I block myself in the middle of the map for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.830
 because there were very low banks 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.460
 being those always done on trevi 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.350
 trevi 3 on setting so there was a 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.530
 when I avo campers in the middle 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.270
 I would change the garment type map and then 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.440
 I decided to upload this 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.900
 however it seemed to me an acceptable video 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.470
 I hope you enjoy that banter 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.190
 bandai useless and boring preambles 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.320
 let's start the waste quickly 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.600
 the weapon because I don't even know the Oscar 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.110
 pinchia sorry also the oscar st a weapon 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.910
 that few people use remains a weapon for 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:59.470
 some ways unruly even though it is anyway 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.690
 strong enough if you take it on 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.390
 just right if you take it 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.770
 crooked this weapon is unusable 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.319
 let's say you need a little 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.200
 no need to use it well 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.180
 of a 9 but above all we need to 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.150
 so much precision because 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.730
 this fire weapon very bad under fire 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.590
 zero connected to a moderate recoil 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.260
 let's say moderate only having a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.620
 so fire electorate is low 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.290
 every stroke that will not go to the sign will be 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.730
 the chance to die because here yes 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.180
 everything counts on the precision on 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.100
 speed let's say this weapon me and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.990
 use with rapid extraction and calcium 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.940
 frankly adjustable is not needed 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.430
 nothing else this weapon my opinion maybe 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.840
 if yes someone is crazy wants to use 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.150
 accessories puts us a quick charger 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.239
 but really I find myself very much 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.800
 good only with 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.640
 Rapid adjustable calcium extraction is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.890
 very very versatile very fast vi 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.120
 I suggest you try it if you maybe 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.879
 you are not loved things like kicks 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.819
 adjustable and proven quick instruction 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:14.530
 the other setup which is quick charger e 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.629
 reflex viewfinder that we also say i 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.510
 like I like those who have a little less though 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.230
 it is for a set of tools plus more camps 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.459
 eroded however I am by my style of 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.750
 I propose you play and I recommend you more 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.790
 hot fast station and football because 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.709
 I don't know is more suited to my style than 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.069
 game that as you will understand by now 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.060
 so much time is extremely 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:42.420
 aggressive so I don't know I recommend it 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.269
 to try as with this setup 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.950
 the alarm with a class that is now there 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.079
 I will say why I want to give myself some 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.819
 quick advice on how to use al 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.700
 better than this potential 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.340
 armed few people use it excuse me 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.850
 the term is antiquated but then there was 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.739
 few people use this weapon few people there 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.139
 uses and few people even less 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.829
 use in the way in my opinion right 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.440
 let's say this weapon is a bit of a weapon 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.549
 heavy in the sense it is not necessary anymore that 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.480
 like an assault rifle you need 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.700
 think of it as if it were one 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.239
 light machine gun because we say 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.889
 which has the best class a bit obese 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.380
 I think it's anti-splinter and light 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.169
 oh well the usual jackal and dexterity 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.020
 this to have maximum speed of 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.930
 movement 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.849
 the bullets ready as usual and there 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.320
 without explosives and in addition also the 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.000
 possibility of a chance to have 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.770
 the weapon ready immediately after the race too 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.660
 if we say that theoretically with 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.490
 this weapon you shouldn't be in often 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.650
 I run around because it's a weapon a bit 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.820
 just heavy and it's not really the thing 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.220
 more suitable core but we run with it 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.950
 I suggest you try this weapon 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.560
 always to be behind I have beside the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.090
 enemies must also be more than one 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.680
 konami submachine gun from the acts then 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.820
 however, throwing enemies in the face 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.770
 so difficult it is not difficult that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.390
 they kill you but you still have a good one 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.010
 advantage 6 a submachine gun perhaps 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.010
 against an assault rifle while this 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.710
 it is heavy obese as I have already said and therefore 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.990
 I advise you to take routes 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.110
 sleepers maybe put in a little more 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.760
 to get behind enigma be sure 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.320
 99 percent to kill them 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:35.050
 without problems another thing is 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.690
 definitely don't overestimate it because 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.960
 it is not a weapon however it is not a weapon 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.830
 incredibly strong you don't have to do 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.000
 try to can commit suicide e 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.770
 fight against 30 enemies if you see 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.229
 too many enemies as advice and escape 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.450
 towards the freedom fregvene of the fact 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.849
 to be in series that is precisely because 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.740
 you are in series, not thrown back, you are not looking 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.539
 to do the multi you save yourself some 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.430
 then good these are personal loans 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:05.200
 however I know that the video is already there 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.180
 finished who I draw to the point up to the CEO 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.210
 to try it this way because Rome 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.120
 It is test it so there is always another 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.950
 which I have to tell you to pass by 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.930
 second channel covered in the speech 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.270
 so video can still be there anyway 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.440
 any chance that you go to 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:26.169
 see some videos that I put there not 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.219
 so based on facebook sign up 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.020
 I like to write in the comments 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.669
 the next video will be a challenge of the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.919
 bear in between for your satisfaction if 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.090
 all will be well and voices will get the 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.560
 next video 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.560
 a greeting to roberto leo
