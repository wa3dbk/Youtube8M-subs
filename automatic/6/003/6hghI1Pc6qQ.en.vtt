00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.540 
months ago to say this is a the last
year<00:01:13.150> old<00:01:13.420> but<00:01:13.690> I'm<00:01:14.409> also<00:01:14.590> sure<00:01:14.890> this<00:01:15.370> was<00:01:15.490> a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
remember having this much confidence is

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.300 
remember having this much confidence is
such<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.940> long<00:02:13.150> time<00:02:13.450> yeah<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.560> think<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:15.190> was

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
such a long time yeah I think that was

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.790 
such a long time yeah I think that was
one<00:02:15.519> of<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> key<00:02:15.909> elements<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:17.050> plums<00:02:17.500> just

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
one of the key elements of plums just

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100 
one of the key elements of plums just
especially<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.550> first<00:02:18.700> half<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.870> team

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
especially in the first half the team

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.420 
especially in the first half the team
was<00:02:20.230> bristling<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.769> energy<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> was

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
was bristling with energy it was

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.180 
was bristling with energy it was
confident<00:02:22.180> there<00:02:23.170> was<00:02:23.260> an<00:02:23.349> urgency<00:02:23.739> about<00:02:23.980> her

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
confident there was an urgency about her

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.460 
confident there was an urgency about her
play<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.909> think<00:02:25.390> fahd<00:02:25.690> year<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> was<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
play and I think fahd year was a was a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.040 
play and I think fahd year was a was a
huge<00:02:26.800> part<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:27.819> uh<00:02:27.880> looking<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
huge part of that but uh looking on to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.460 
huge part of that but uh looking on to
choose<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.710> know<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.010> to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
choose to know we have to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.890 
choose to know we have to
we<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.980> build<00:02:31.190> in<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.460> i<00:02:32.150> think<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
we have to build in this i think the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.620 
we have to build in this i think the
kata<00:02:33.290> Noi<00:02:33.880> separately<00:02:34.880> equals<00:02:35.150> x<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.390> the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
kata Noi separately equals x is the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.050 
kata Noi separately equals x is the
common<00:02:35.900> increasingly<00:02:36.320> important<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.160> I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
common increasingly important and I

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.870 
common increasingly important and I
think<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.470> could<00:02:39.530> define<00:02:40.280> our<00:02:40.460> season

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
think that I could define our season

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.130 
think that I could define our season
overall<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.260> think<00:02:43.100> we<00:02:43.580> have<00:02:43.960> we've<00:02:44.960> done

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
overall and I think we have we've done

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.590 
overall and I think we have we've done
incredibly<00:02:45.620> well<00:02:45.700> yesterday<00:02:46.700> performance<00:02:47.480> is

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
incredibly well yesterday performance is

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.960 
incredibly well yesterday performance is
a<00:02:47.630> great<00:02:48.110> stepping<00:02:48.710> stone<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.610> copper

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
a great stepping stone on to the copper

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.870 
a great stepping stone on to the copper
and<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.630> rest<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.440> season<00:02:51.680> even<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.670> beat

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
and the rest of the season even to beat

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.050 
and the rest of the season even to beat
Bologna<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:54.080> thing<00:02:54.380> definitely<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:55.280> to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
kind of performance we throw in is if we

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.060 
kind of performance we throw in is if we
if<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.360> really<00:03:08.600> set<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.170> tone<00:03:09.350> early<00:03:09.650> and

if we can really set the tone early and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.640 
if we can really set the tone early and
we<00:03:10.459> can<00:03:10.610> actually<00:03:10.930> walk<00:03:11.930> away<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.410> three

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.190 
we can actually walk away with three
points<00:03:13.100> or<00:03:13.250> actually<00:03:13.730> take<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.300> step<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:14.959> the

contenders and I think the important
thing<00:03:33.350> is<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:34.010> it's<00:03:34.640> like<00:03:35.060> three<00:03:35.450> or<00:03:35.570> four

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
thing is and it's like three or four

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.440 
thing is and it's like three or four
years<00:03:36.170> time<00:03:36.430> we<00:03:37.430> don't<00:03:37.670> want<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.910> look<00:03:38.000> back<00:03:38.269> in

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
years time we don't want to look back in

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
players you brought an artic

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.640 
players you brought an artic
increasingly<00:05:36.849> settled<00:05:37.509> and<00:05:37.719> I'm<00:05:38.409> actually

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
increasingly settled and I'm actually

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.100 
increasingly settled and I'm actually
quite<00:05:39.009> confident<00:05:39.639> that<00:05:39.729> I<00:05:39.879> will<00:05:40.300> give<00:05:41.080> a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
quite confident that I will give a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.140 
quite confident that I will give a
different<00:05:41.409> performance<00:05:42.189> on<00:05:42.400> shoes<00:05:42.759> due<00:05:43.000> to

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
different performance on shoes due to

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.700 
different performance on shoes due to
the<00:05:43.270> one<00:05:43.449> we<00:05:43.479> gave<00:05:43.750> him<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.020> Derby<00:05:44.379> I<00:05:44.409> think

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
the one we gave him the Derby I think

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.680 
the one we gave him the Derby I think
things<00:05:44.979> are<00:05:45.219> very<00:05:45.400> different<00:05:45.729> now<00:05:45.909> things

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
things are very different now things

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.990 
things are very different now things
have<00:05:46.839> changed<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.589> I<00:05:47.860> think<00:05:48.580> we<00:05:48.669> can<00:05:48.789> really

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
have changed and I think we can really

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.640 
have changed and I think we can really
go<00:05:49.210> out<00:05:49.330> there<00:05:49.539> and<00:05:49.599> achieve<00:05:49.870> something<00:05:50.139> but

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
go out there and achieve something but

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.670 
go out there and achieve something but
it's<00:05:51.490> football<00:05:51.759> you<00:05:52.060> never<00:05:52.270> knew<00:05:52.479> I<00:05:52.750> think

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
it's football you never knew I think

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.379 
it's football you never knew I think

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
that they was just as excited to get to

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.390 
that they was just as excited to get to

as the game was done he ran right into
the<00:05:59.020> tunnel<00:05:59.319> I<00:05:59.379> don't<00:05:59.560> know<00:05:59.650> if<00:05:59.800> he<00:05:59.919> was<00:06:00.039> late

that I thought looked to be in a
desperate<00:06:04.870> rush<00:06:05.319> but<00:06:05.680> uh<00:06:05.710> I<00:06:06.069> think<00:06:06.849> you<00:06:07.270> know
