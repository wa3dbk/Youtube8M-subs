I<00:02:12.430> understand<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:14.470> code<00:02:14.650> which<00:02:14.800> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
I understand this is the code which is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.400

there and they are also going to put out
a<00:02:26.020> nice<00:02:26.380> amount<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:27.580> base<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.360> also<00:02:28.630> stand

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
a nice amount of base you can also stand

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.890 
a nice amount of base you can also stand
the<00:02:29.140> system<00:02:29.470> up<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.860> its<00:02:29.980> side<00:02:30.070> like<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the system up on its side like so and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.290 
the system up on its side like so and
you've<00:02:31.990> got<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> nice<00:02:32.260> handle<00:02:32.650> there<00:02:32.800> for<00:02:32.980> Kerry

um it looks very very nice and what from

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.170 
um it looks very very nice and what from
what<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.930> see<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.610> can't<00:02:39.610> really<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:40.030> this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
what I can see I can't really do this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.240 
what I can see I can't really do this
out<00:02:40.420> too<00:02:40.660> much<00:02:40.780> more<00:02:41.110> though<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:42.100> that's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
out too much more though but that's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.350 
out too much more though but that's
basically<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.790> system<00:02:43.209> as<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.660> without

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
basically the system as it is without

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
basically the system as it is without
