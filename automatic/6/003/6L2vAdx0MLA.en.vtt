can<00:02:30.069> actually<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.640> any<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.560> project

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
can actually do any of that in a project

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.940 
can actually do any of that in a project
like<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.310> we<00:02:33.580> need<00:02:33.730> all<00:02:33.970> kinds<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.600> equipment

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
like this we need all kinds of equipment

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.470 
like this we need all kinds of equipment
we're<00:02:35.950> trying<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.250> be<00:02:36.370> minimalist<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.330> we're

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
we're trying to be minimalist so we're

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.330 
we're trying to be minimalist so we're
trying<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.720> keep<00:02:37.870> everything<00:02:38.170> portable<00:02:38.830> but

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
and then of course there's the safety

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.199 
and then of course there's the safety
factor<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:50.829> of<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.250> stuff<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:52.120> have
