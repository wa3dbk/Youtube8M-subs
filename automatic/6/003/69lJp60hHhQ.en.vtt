in<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.309> opinion<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> HUD<00:00:57.329> controls<00:00:57.750> plus<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
in my opinion of HUD controls plus it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
in my opinion of HUD controls plus it
allows<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> add<00:00:58.770> song<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> artist<00:00:59.760> and

display<00:01:03.930> while<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.589> playing<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> have

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
display while it's playing then you have

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.010

brightness<00:01:07.500> heads-up<00:01:07.979> display<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
brightness heads-up display and then you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.859 
brightness heads-up display and then you
can<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> time<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
can have the time on there as well so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
can have the time on there as well so
it's<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.439> thorough<00:01:10.710> tweak<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.820> can
