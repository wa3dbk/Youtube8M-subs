00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
he spawns again he'll have different

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
he spawns again he'll have different
ones<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.649> him<00:01:55.770> again<00:01:55.890> I'll<00:01:56.040> make<00:01:56.610> an

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
annotation of that but pretty much the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.440 
annotation of that but pretty much the
same<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.200> overall<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.280> he's<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
same as them overall and he's up on this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.899

a<00:02:51.580> rare<00:02:51.850> spawn<00:02:52.230> rare<00:02:53.230> loop<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:55.060> they<00:02:55.180> were

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
a rare spawn rare loop but they were

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.530
