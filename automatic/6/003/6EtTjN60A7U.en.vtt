00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.090
 the only design archetype for 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.730
 combat knives is the claw and this 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.550
 is the dismissal closely is designed 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.369
 by relocating rosso is designed with a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.739
 defensive and tactical knife 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 of course like all daggers is a 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.000
 combat knife what is 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.700
 particularly special in this dagger is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 that to compensate for the weakness of 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.070
 grind the leaf in four zones 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 daga rosso is made of steel 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.580
 forged 1050 as can be expected is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.470
 supremely agile in hand 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.880
 machined holes in the handle 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.650
 they have a greater 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.470
 maneuverability and because it is a 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.900
 1050 solid piece of steel is feasible 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.630
 use it in countless tasks 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.160
 to hit leverage and of course 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.980
 for which a dagger was designed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.900
 eject has a hardness of 55 in 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.270
 rockwell what is quite respectable 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.400
 For a forged steel and the coating 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.680
 it's from an electrostatic painting in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.110
 long-lasting dust to avoid 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 corrosion typical of this type of steel 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.790
 one of the limitations of the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.700
 dagger 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.010
 having a sharpened end completely is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.560
 that is difficult to carry so the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.760
 rice comes with a rigid case that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.850
 mechanically holds the dagger and that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.340
 It is also designed to be carried in 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.550
 the forearm on the ankle or to be 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.380
 mounted on the belt vertically or 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.290
 horizontal the retention is supremely 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.960
 sure it's very light it has only 140 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.390
 grams and has a useful edge of 3 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.520
 inches although there are many algae in 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.580
 the market this is an excellent option 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.590
 versus the duration of the tool 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.869
 that as I said at the beginning is for 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.970
 yes a weakness of the design by 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.920
 another side like in other daggers the center 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.020
 Gravity is deep in the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.880
 mango how lucky it feels 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.550
 safe in your hand and despite your 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.869
 Small size has a very comfortable weight 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.840
 to maneuver 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.840
 this is the dagger roasting up close t
