00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.559
 my name Horacio Rodriguez was raped sailors I am a teacher of the 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.800
 National University of Mar del Plata 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 and conicet researcher for now we are located here in the port of 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.880
 necochea and quequén we are here because an example is located in the port 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.479
 colonies of the largest marine in the province of Buenos Aires Lima 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.780
 nor rifles ar-15 mayors in 2003 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.340
 among the nations 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.540
 marine mammal laboratory 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.030
 in an interview this year economic growth in a moment 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 like this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.249
 As the 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.529
 I'm afraid of the idea that we have of the dead, there are more humble children at the moment in 

00:00:55.529 --> 00:01:00.019
 20 most youth basketball cities when we started to 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.979
 study these colonies mainly the colony the gate sea of ​​silver to 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.840
 In the late 70's and 80's I had a slightly different view 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.659
 of what it was in these colonies because 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.890
 to understand why there are animals in port and why 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.400
 that's why everyone is almost completely male 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.020
 percent the center Bethlehem in the essential part of totanés and what is known 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.710
 as a mating system 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.650
 that is, they are animals that are known as polyclinics 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.220
 poly gineco means that during the reproductive season a male 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.080
 monopolizes access to a group of females in general 4 5% 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.810
 so that if we understand that there is a male that fecundates 4 5 in the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 adults will see a series of May that they will not be able to be 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 males compete with each other for access to females 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.750
 so that always male losers we understood that you do not see a 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.980
 group of males in port were animals that were during a certain time of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:01.840
 his life 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.060
 is basically stationed in the ports maturing it having 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.010
 experience when competing econsult your former partner but not for access to 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.770
 posterity females when they were adults were moving towards other colonies 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.770
 reproductive what also to be able to 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.779
 in this dynamic mainly frame the animals because because if 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.489
 one comes to the wolfhound and looks at it and it seems that they are all animals 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.599
 they feel the same 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.569
 but the wrong way and being able to identify it one can do a longitudinal study 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.409
 and follow the animal 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.409
 through it the time and several particulars 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.319
 For this season 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.319
 every day sara 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.729
 but now 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.909
 to make it 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 according to claim that a shoemaker 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.939
 Russia 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.119
 and considering the lottery 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.449
 we have 100 animals fish and animals are 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:19.569
 1 one is targeted train el marchal last private partner same without animals 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.949
 another 100 animals all and these animals that are in turn feed 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.749
 12 offshore that experience breakdown despite promoting that the size of the 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.109
 colony really 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.109
 much beyond what one observes when it was 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.879
 they are characteristics that we look for other 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.700
 fact that we study 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.649
 It is mainly the diet 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:50.629
 in the diet is done through the collection of fecal samples in terms of 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.799
 cameras and all 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.799
 they also talk about missiles as they will lose too 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:58.959
 meanwhile the goal of maintaining good health 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.919
 for this the laboratory 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.909
 the love of the acquis that allows us to know what is the position within 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.379
 the food chain that these animals have 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.379
 in the coastal sector of the prov 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.809
 one of the headquarters where the thing that we could 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.019
 to confirm 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.529
 during the last two reproductive seasons 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:26.489
 these animals that we see here in the harbor resting sleeping good 

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:29.509
 part of the day many of them skinny 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.759
 will reach the breeding populations with an excellent 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.150
 physical condition so that it has probably been a period of 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.360
 prolonged limitation at sea before reaching headquarters 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.590
 reproductive colonies and not only that but we have already determined that 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.060
 many of them formed area so that in a high proportion of the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.639
 that go have reproductive activity this summer for example we found 28 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.639
 animals in patagones while 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.740
 our history 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.020
 apparently what we thought were losers 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 hens are losers are fine 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.830
 group of bachelors that spend the winter away from the females but that all the 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.009
 summers tend for their work 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.009
 to the detainee possible up to half near the aggression 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.770
 following the order in the middle of a scandal of dimensions that go 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.080
 growing 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.759
 and I would not do it in 2010 represent
