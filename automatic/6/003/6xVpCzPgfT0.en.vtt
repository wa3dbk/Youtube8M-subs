hi I'm dr. Michelin Vargas and I am a
research<00:00:10.570> scientist<00:00:11.049> here<00:00:11.410> at<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.590> Nutrilite

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:12.039 
research scientist here at the Nutrilite

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.580 
research scientist here at the Nutrilite
Health<00:00:12.309> Institute<00:00:12.580> and<00:00:13.180> today<00:00:14.139> we<00:00:14.320> are<00:00:14.440> going

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
Health Institute and today we are going

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.689 
Health Institute and today we are going
to<00:00:14.680> talk<00:00:14.860> about<00:00:15.010> fat<00:00:15.459> and<00:00:15.850> not<00:00:16.630> body<00:00:16.900> fat<00:00:17.140> but

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
to talk about fat and not body fat but

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.460 
to talk about fat and not body fat but
dietary<00:00:18.699> fat<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.240> what<00:00:19.630> types<00:00:19.869> of<00:00:20.020> fats<00:00:20.200> are

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
dietary fat and what types of fats are

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.130 
dietary fat and what types of fats are
healthy<00:00:20.950> and<00:00:21.130> what<00:00:22.060> types<00:00:22.270> of<00:00:22.420> fats<00:00:22.600> should<00:00:22.990> we

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
healthy and what types of fats should we

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.280 
healthy and what types of fats should we
maybe<00:00:23.320> reduce<00:00:23.830> or<00:00:24.280> stay<00:00:24.910> away<00:00:25.120> from<00:00:25.290> almost

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
maybe reduce or stay away from almost

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.500 
maybe reduce or stay away from almost
all<00:00:26.440> together<00:00:26.800> so<00:00:27.610> when<00:00:27.880> we<00:00:28.000> talk<00:00:28.180> about

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
all together so when we talk about

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.029 
all together so when we talk about
different<00:00:28.750> types<00:00:29.050> of<00:00:29.170> fats<00:00:29.350> they<00:00:29.620> really<00:00:29.890> are

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
different types of fats they really are

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.980 
different types of fats they really are
very<00:00:30.310> different<00:00:30.610> there<00:00:31.060> are<00:00:31.210> some<00:00:31.539> types<00:00:31.810> of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
very different there are some types of

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.080 
very different there are some types of
fats<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.379> are<00:00:32.469> really<00:00:32.829> good<00:00:33.070> for<00:00:33.309> you<00:00:33.460> when

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
fats that are really good for you when

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.939 
fats that are really good for you when
we<00:00:34.239> differentiate<00:00:34.840> between<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.469> types<00:00:35.800> of

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
we differentiate between the types of

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.160 
we differentiate between the types of
fats<00:00:36.129> we<00:00:36.399> usually<00:00:36.730> talk<00:00:36.879> about<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.359> saturated

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
fats we usually talk about the saturated

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.130 
fats we usually talk about the saturated
fats<00:00:38.499> and<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.980> unsaturated<00:00:39.460> fats<00:00:40.089> and<00:00:40.449> the

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
fats and the unsaturated fats and the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.809 
fats and the unsaturated fats and the
saturated<00:00:41.710> fats<00:00:42.010> these<00:00:42.309> are<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.519> ones<00:00:42.730> that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:42.819 
saturated fats these are the ones that

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.329 
saturated fats these are the ones that
are<00:00:43.030> solid<00:00:43.719> typically<00:00:44.440> at<00:00:44.620> room<00:00:44.800> temperature

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
are solid typically at room temperature

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.860 
are solid typically at room temperature
so<00:00:45.370> you<00:00:45.579> think<00:00:45.819> about<00:00:46.059> like<00:00:46.239> butter<00:00:46.600> or<00:00:46.839> lard

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
so you think about like butter or lard

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.169 
so you think about like butter or lard
and<00:00:47.559> these<00:00:48.159> are<00:00:48.339> the<00:00:48.429> ones<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.760> can<00:00:48.969> actually

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
and these are the ones that can actually

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.479 
and these are the ones that can actually
increase<00:00:49.899> your<00:00:50.170> unhealthy<00:00:50.649> or<00:00:50.920> your<00:00:51.219> lousy

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
increase your unhealthy or your lousy

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.559 
increase your unhealthy or your lousy
cholesterol<00:00:52.329> like<00:00:52.780> your<00:00:52.929> LDL<00:00:53.350> cholesterol

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
cholesterol like your LDL cholesterol

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.709 
cholesterol like your LDL cholesterol
whereas<00:00:55.569> the<00:00:55.809> unsaturated<00:00:56.649> fats<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:58.539> the

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
whereas the unsaturated fats or the

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.599 
whereas the unsaturated fats or the
monounsaturated<00:00:59.199> of<00:01:00.069> the<00:01:00.159> polyunsaturated

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
monounsaturated of the polyunsaturated

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.869 
monounsaturated of the polyunsaturated
can<00:01:01.479> actually<00:01:01.870> have<00:01:02.019> some<00:01:02.229> health<00:01:02.469> benefits

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
can actually have some health benefits

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.580 
can actually have some health benefits
now<00:01:03.879> they<00:01:04.239> still<00:01:04.540> have<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:05.049> lot<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.290> energy

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
now they still have a lot of energy

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.070 
now they still have a lot of energy
meaning<00:01:06.159> they<00:01:06.220> have<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.370> lot<00:01:06.549> of<00:01:06.670> calories<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
meaning they have a lot of calories so

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.590 
meaning they have a lot of calories so
we<00:01:08.260> still<00:01:08.470> have<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.770> modify<00:01:09.430> how<00:01:10.090> much<00:01:10.390> we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
we still have to modify how much we

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.720 
we still have to modify how much we
consume<00:01:11.110> but<00:01:11.800> we<00:01:11.890> really<00:01:12.220> want<00:01:12.550> to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
consume but we really want to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.730 
consume but we really want to
incorporate<00:01:13.000> those<00:01:13.420> into<00:01:13.480> our<00:01:13.840> diet<00:01:14.050> well

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
incorporate those into our diet well

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.770 
incorporate those into our diet well
monounsaturated<00:01:15.100> fats<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.180> get<00:01:16.360> from<00:01:16.570> things

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
monounsaturated fats you get from things

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.530 
monounsaturated fats you get from things
like<00:01:16.870> avocados<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.550> some<00:01:18.790> of<00:01:18.880> your<00:01:19.000> nuts<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
like avocados and some of your nuts and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.590 
like avocados and some of your nuts and
your<00:01:19.630> polyunsaturated<00:01:20.590> fats<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:22.150> get<00:01:22.330> from

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
your polyunsaturated fats you get from

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.110 
your polyunsaturated fats you get from
things<00:01:22.840> like<00:01:22.930> fish<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.490> when<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.790> hear<00:01:24.970> the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
things like fish so when you hear the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.960 
things like fish so when you hear the
term<00:01:25.300> omega-3<00:01:26.230> fatty<00:01:26.470> acids<00:01:27.040> those<00:01:27.700> are

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
term omega-3 fatty acids those are

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.870 
term omega-3 fatty acids those are
polyunsaturated<00:01:28.510> fats<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.860> these<00:01:30.400> provide

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
polyunsaturated fats and these provide

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.790 
polyunsaturated fats and these provide
you<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> lot<00:01:31.330> of<00:01:31.450> health<00:01:31.690> benefits<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.500> lot<00:01:32.680> of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
you a lot of health benefits a lot of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.960 
you a lot of health benefits a lot of
protection<00:01:33.040> there's<00:01:33.730> a<00:01:33.790> lot<00:01:33.940> of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
protection there's a lot of

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.690 
protection there's a lot of
cardiovascular<00:01:34.810> health<00:01:34.990> benefits<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.520> we

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
cardiovascular health benefits so we

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.280 
cardiovascular health benefits so we
typically<00:01:37.060> will<00:01:37.210> recommend<00:01:37.690> people<00:01:37.810> eat<00:01:38.170> at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
typically will recommend people eat at

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.050 
typically will recommend people eat at
least<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.650> couple<00:01:38.770> servings<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.460> fish<00:01:39.730> if

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
least a couple servings of fish if

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.570 
least a couple servings of fish if
somebody<00:01:40.810> doesn't<00:01:41.080> like<00:01:41.410> fish<00:01:41.770> or<00:01:42.040> if<00:01:42.340> they

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
somebody doesn't like fish or if they

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.490 
somebody doesn't like fish or if they
have<00:01:42.910> maybe<00:01:43.270> known<00:01:43.600> risk<00:01:43.900> for<00:01:44.290> some

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
have maybe known risk for some

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.760 
have maybe known risk for some
cardiovascular<00:01:45.510> disease<00:01:46.510> we<00:01:47.290> might<00:01:47.500> want<00:01:47.680> to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
cardiovascular disease we might want to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.530 
cardiovascular disease we might want to
recommend<00:01:48.160> even<00:01:48.580> higher<00:01:48.880> amounts<00:01:49.420> and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
recommend even higher amounts and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.050 
recommend even higher amounts and
supplementation<00:01:50.670> sometimes<00:01:51.670> people<00:01:51.970> get

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
supplementation sometimes people get

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.520 
supplementation sometimes people get
confused<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.570> they<00:01:52.690> think<00:01:52.750> any<00:01:53.050> fish<00:01:53.350> is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
confused and they think any fish is

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.260 
confused and they think any fish is
going<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.740> provide<00:01:54.070> an<00:01:54.340> adequate<00:01:54.490> amount<00:01:54.880> of

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
going to provide an adequate amount of

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.110 
going to provide an adequate amount of
omega-3<00:01:56.080> fats<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.190> that's<00:01:57.550> not<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.880> case<00:01:58.060> you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
omega-3 fats and that's not the case you

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.060 
omega-3 fats and that's not the case you
have<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.690> get<00:01:58.810> certain<00:01:59.140> types<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.590> fish<00:01:59.800> like

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
have to get certain types of fish like

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.180
