00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.540 

and<00:00:48.820> then<00:00:49.059> we're<00:00:49.210> going<00:00:49.329> to<00:00:49.390> slide<00:00:49.660> up<00:00:49.840> here<00:00:49.870> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and then we're going to slide up here on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.210 
and then we're going to slide up here on
the<00:00:51.550> D<00:00:52.180> string<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.840> fifth<00:00:53.050> fret

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
the D string to the fifth fret

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.190 
the D string to the fifth fret
and<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:56.030> like<00:00:56.240> to<00:00:56.360> play<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.750> fifth<00:00:56.990> fret

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
and I like to play this fifth fret

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.400 
and I like to play this fifth fret
instead<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.650> just<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.920> open<00:00:58.280> G<00:00:59.260> because<00:01:00.260> it

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
instead of just the open G because it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.000 
instead of just the open G because it
sounds<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:00.980> little<00:01:01.100> more<00:01:01.550> stable<00:01:02.620> but<00:01:03.620> either

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
sounds a little more stable but either

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.870 
sounds a little more stable but either
you<00:01:04.280> could<00:01:04.430> do<00:01:04.520> an<00:01:04.610> open<00:01:04.970> G<00:01:05.420> or<00:01:05.800> this<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.700> then

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
you could do an open G or this and then

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.090 
you could do an open G or this and then
we<00:01:08.030> go<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.540> second<00:01:08.930> fret<00:01:09.170> right<00:01:09.770> after

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we go to the second fret right after

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.950 
we go to the second fret right after
that<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.000> same<00:01:11.330> string<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:11.930> we<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:16.960> then

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
that on the same string so we have then

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.580 
that on the same string so we have then
we<00:01:18.050> repeat<00:01:18.320> that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.179 

then<00:01:21.280> fourth<00:01:21.610> fret

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
then fourth fret

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
then fourth fret
second<00:01:24.150> fret<00:01:24.470> open<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.040> D<00:01:26.189> string<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
second fret open on the D string so the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:40.880 
second fret open on the D string so the
last<00:01:27.869> part<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:39.350> do<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.440> repeat<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> whole

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
last part is so do we repeat the whole

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.820 
last part is so do we repeat the whole
riff<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.680> press<00:01:46.860> D<00:01:47.430> once<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> song

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
riff but we just press D once the song

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.800 
riff but we just press D once the song
instead<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:49.979> twice<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> riff<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
instead of twice and that is the riff to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.399 
instead of twice and that is the riff to
beat<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.039> here<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.460> are<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.640> E<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.509> he<00:01:55.259> does

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409

and then we'll go to see once halfway
through<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> verse<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.140> go

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.930 

II<00:02:16.520> D<00:02:17.520> then<00:02:18.300> we're<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> see<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.990> time
