it's<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.370> room<00:00:38.610> temperature<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.210> I've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's at room temperature so I've got it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.910 
it's at room temperature so I've got it
sitting<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.469> bit<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sitting out for a little bit if you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.350 
sitting out for a little bit if you
don't<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.489> yours<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.790> room<00:00:41.910> temperature

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
don't have yours at room temperature

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
don't have yours at room temperature
just<00:00:42.719> nuke<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> couple<00:00:43.649> seconds<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
just nuke it for a couple seconds so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
just nuke it for a couple seconds so
that<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.360> kind<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.750> soft<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.590> go

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that it's kind of soft so it will go

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.279 
that it's kind of soft so it will go
into<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.370> powders<00:00:47.700> easier<00:00:48.090> we're<00:00:48.960> gonna<00:00:49.079> put
