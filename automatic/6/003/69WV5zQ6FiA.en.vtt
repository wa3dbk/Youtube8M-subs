00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
for shippers planes anyone that hasn't

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.479 
for shippers planes anyone that hasn't
gotten<00:02:54.139> any<00:02:54.319> mum<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.739> I<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:54.980> wants<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.280> check

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
gotten any mum so I just wants to check

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.849 
gotten any mum so I just wants to check
out<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> wind<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:57.079> better<00:02:57.260> than<00:02:57.410> any<00:02:57.500> mortars

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
out the wind the better than any mortars

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:58.930 
out the wind the better than any mortars
really<00:02:58.100> because<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.459> just<00:02:58.579> go<00:02:58.760> out<00:02:58.819> and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
really because you can just go out and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.729 
really because you can just go out and
say<00:02:59.090> that's<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.389> force<00:02:59.630> five<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.170> that's<00:03:00.620> a

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
say that's a force five and that's a

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.740 
say that's a force five and that's a
fall<00:03:00.920> six

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.450 

of<00:03:05.810> experience<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.380> think<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> force<00:03:06.920> 11<00:03:07.340> on

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
of experience I think is a force 11 on

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.730 
of experience I think is a force 11 on
the<00:03:07.550> coast<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.270> coast<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.660> Wales<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.710> that

snow<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:19.910> ice<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.300> mentis<00:03:20.720> though<00:03:20.840> with<00:03:20.960> the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
snow and ice just mentis though with the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.780 
snow and ice just mentis though with the
first<00:03:21.260> time<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.620> video<00:03:21.800> it's<00:03:22.400> really

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
first time in this video it's really

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.510 
first time in this video it's really
excited<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.360> love<00:03:23.600> snow<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.020> for<00:03:24.380> those<00:03:24.520> the

very a good I like BBC weathers are lots
of<00:03:41.060> good<00:03:41.180> place<00:03:41.360> he'll<00:03:41.570> be<00:03:41.690> on<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.870> weather

recommend weather action calm for the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.460 
recommend weather action calm for the
other<00:03:47.270> side<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.660> climate<00:03:47.989> change<00:03:48.230> air

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
other side the climate change air

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.010 
other side the climate change air
climate<00:03:48.830> realists<00:03:49.340> as<00:03:49.430> well<00:03:49.810> recommend<00:03:50.810> them

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
climate realists as well recommend them

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.800 
climate realists as well recommend them
for<00:03:51.050> some<00:03:51.440> other<00:03:51.830> opinions<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.690> get

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
for some other opinions and just to get

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.050 
for some other opinions and just to get
going<00:03:54.020> over<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.010> forecast<00:03:55.520> I<00:03:55.580> think<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.850> end<00:03:55.970> of

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
going over a forecast I think the end of

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.850 
going over a forecast I think the end of
November<00:03:56.510> will<00:03:56.630> be<00:03:56.660> quite<00:03:56.900> wintery<00:03:57.290> unsettled

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
November will be quite wintery unsettled

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.160 
November will be quite wintery unsettled
if<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.700> work<00:03:58.910> out<00:03:59.150> on<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.420> low<00:03:59.690> pressure<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
if you work out on a low pressure it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.540 
if you work out on a low pressure it
goes<00:04:00.410> like<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:00.830> in<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.070> clockwise

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
goes like this in the clockwise

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.400 
goes like this in the clockwise
yeah<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.810> that's<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.020> way<00:04:03.110> you're<00:04:03.260> viewing

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
yeah and that's the way you're viewing

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.490 
yeah and that's the way you're viewing
it<00:04:03.560> clockwise<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.430> Great<00:04:04.640> Britain<00:04:05.470> get<00:04:06.470> a

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
it clockwise this is Great Britain get a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.920 
it clockwise this is Great Britain get a
no<00:04:06.680> low<00:04:06.950> pressure<00:04:07.250> coming<00:04:07.459> through<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.750> then

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
no low pressure coming through and then

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.509 
no low pressure coming through and then
the<00:04:09.050> back<00:04:09.260> end<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.590> low<00:04:09.830> pressure<00:04:10.040> just<00:04:10.340> was

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
the back end that low pressure just was

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.479 
the back end that low pressure just was
left<00:04:10.850> exit<00:04:11.239> into<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.600> into<00:04:12.019> a<00:04:12.200> central<00:04:13.130> Europe

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
left exit into a into a central Europe

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.479 
left exit into a into a central Europe
you<00:04:14.090> get<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.269> northerly<00:04:14.630> flow

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.100 

now<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.549> Northland<00:04:19.030> flows<00:04:19.330> can<00:04:19.660> create<00:04:19.930> some

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
now the Northland flows can create some

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.020 
now the Northland flows can create some
quite<00:04:20.620> harsh<00:04:20.890> conditions<00:04:21.430> with<00:04:21.610> rain<00:04:21.820> and

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
quite harsh conditions with rain and

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.360 
quite harsh conditions with rain and
wind<00:04:22.210> as<00:04:22.420> yes<00:04:22.900> quite<00:04:23.140> stable<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:24.220> another

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
wind as yes quite stable but another

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.220 
wind as yes quite stable but another
thing<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.730> mention<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.360> creator

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
thing to mention is that the creator

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.450 
thing to mention is that the creator
office<00:04:26.590> while<00:04:26.770> only<00:04:26.890> as<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> low-pressure

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
office while only as a low-pressure

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.550 
office while only as a low-pressure
themselves<00:04:28.090> specifically<00:04:29.020> when<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.380> back

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
themselves specifically when the back

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.470 
themselves specifically when the back
edge<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:29.920> top<00:04:30.160> comes<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.760> this<00:04:31.060> cooler

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
edge of that top comes and this cooler

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.360 
edge of that top comes and this cooler
air<00:04:31.660> introduced<00:04:32.170> from<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.890> article

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
air introduced from the article

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.120 
air introduced from the article
somewhere<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.680> when<00:04:35.830> tame

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
somewhere like that and when tame

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.760 
somewhere like that and when tame
temperatures<00:04:36.730> at<00:04:36.840> 850<00:04:37.840> HBA<00:04:38.260> which<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:38.710> a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
temperatures at 850 HBA which is just a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.230 
temperatures at 850 HBA which is just a
level<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.190> atmosphere<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:39.670> you<00:04:39.940> don't

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
level in the atmosphere that you don't

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.520 
level in the atmosphere that you don't
need<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.420> know<00:04:40.570> where<00:04:40.720> it's<00:04:41.110> about<00:04:41.260> five

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
need to know where it's about five

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.160 
need to know where it's about five
thousand<00:04:41.950> feet<00:04:42.390> if<00:04:43.390> temperatures<00:04:43.960> there

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
thousand feet if temperatures there

thousand feet if temperatures there
minus<00:04:45.010> 5<00:04:45.220> or<00:04:45.430> below<00:04:45.550> well<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:46.540> could<00:04:46.720> get<00:04:46.810> some

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
minus 5 or below well it could get some

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.330 
minus 5 or below well it could get some
really<00:04:47.200> bad<00:04:47.440> snow<00:04:47.710> there<00:04:47.920> and<00:04:48.100> snow

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
really bad snow there and snow

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.210 
really bad snow there and snow
conditions<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:50.050> that's<00:04:50.380> when<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.770> really<00:04:51.010> in

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
conditions and that's when you really in

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.999 
conditions and that's when you really in
first<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.580> for

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.459 

when<00:04:55.129> you<00:04:55.249> get<00:04:55.400> below<00:04:55.580> minus-10<00:04:55.999> at<00:04:56.270> 8:50<00:04:57.080> HPA

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
when you get below minus-10 at 8:50 HPA

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.559 
when you get below minus-10 at 8:50 HPA
well<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.039> really<00:04:58.309> in<00:04:58.400> some<00:04:58.909> thick<00:04:59.150> snow<00:04:59.360> there

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
well you really in some thick snow there

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.149 
well you really in some thick snow there
especially<00:05:00.080> when<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:00.469> get<00:05:00.559> the<00:05:00.619> convection

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
especially when you get the convection

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.429 
especially when you get the convection

2008<00:05:11.509> that<00:05:12.050> was<00:05:12.169> a<00:05:12.259> bad<00:05:12.439> day<00:05:12.649> as<00:05:12.710> well

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.089 
2008 that was a bad day as well

2008 that was a bad day as well
nothing's<00:05:14.089> gonna<00:05:14.210> be<00:05:14.389> anywhere<00:05:14.749> near<00:05:15.080> there

at all

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.200 
at all
I<00:05:16.009> think<00:05:16.189> we're<00:05:16.339> just<00:05:16.369> going<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.639> get<00:05:16.789> wintry

well to aquele Shenzhen settlements know

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.570 
well to aquele Shenzhen settlements know
I<00:05:26.030> think<00:05:26.419> nuts<00:05:26.870> binnorie<00:05:27.500> above<00:05:27.800> 200<00:05:28.250> meters

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
I think nuts binnorie above 200 meters

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.070 
I think nuts binnorie above 200 meters
from<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.240> north<00:05:29.449> of<00:05:29.569> England<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:30.050> Scotland

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
from the north of England and Scotland

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.640 
from the north of England and Scotland
are<00:05:30.830> on<00:05:31.069> the<00:05:31.190> island<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.669> above<00:05:32.449> 40<00:05:33.289> metres

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
are on the island and above 40 metres

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.400 
are on the island and above 40 metres
for<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.099> middle<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.460> Wales<00:05:34.789> and<00:05:35.180> versa

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.260 

I<00:05:40.440> think<00:05:41.190> snow<00:05:41.370> don't<00:05:41.610> need<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.820> pen<00:05:42.000> Islands

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
I think snow don't need the pen Islands

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.460 
I think snow don't need the pen Islands
and<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.420> Scottish<00:05:42.690> mountains<00:05:43.140> could<00:05:43.290> get<00:05:43.440> a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
and the Scottish mountains could get a

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.530 
and the Scottish mountains could get a
good<00:05:43.770> dose<00:05:43.920> of<00:05:44.100> snow<00:05:44.340> if<00:05:44.850> we<00:05:45.000> got<00:05:45.120> time<00:05:45.330> though

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
good dose of snow if we got time though

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.460 
good dose of snow if we got time though
and<00:05:45.720> that's<00:05:45.840> going<00:05:45.960> to<00:05:46.050> lead<00:05:46.140> on<00:05:46.260> to<00:05:46.380> the

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
and that's going to lead on to the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.290 
and that's going to lead on to the
beginning<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.800> December<00:05:46.890> as<00:05:47.310> well<00:05:47.460> as<00:05:47.970> I<00:05:48.030> said

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
beginning of December as well as I said

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.020 
beginning of December as well as I said

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
of high pressure and that makes it cold

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.040 
of high pressure and that makes it cold
high<00:06:26.700> pressure<00:06:26.730> makes<00:06:27.270> it<00:06:27.420> warm<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:27.750> so<00:06:27.840> ever
