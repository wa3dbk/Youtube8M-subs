it's<00:01:46.460> actually<00:01:46.579> pulling<00:01:47.000> your<00:01:47.180> BlackBerry

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's actually pulling your BlackBerry

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.319 
it's actually pulling your BlackBerry
out<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.979> would<00:01:49.130> take<00:01:49.310> time<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.060> do<00:01:50.210> have

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
out it would take time but you do have

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.899 
out it would take time but you do have
to<00:01:50.390> kind<00:01:50.659> of<00:01:50.750> open<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.590> lip<00:01:51.799> grab<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.850> then

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
to kind of open the lip grab it and then

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.260 
to kind of open the lip grab it and then
pull<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.990> again<00:01:54.829> it<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.130> very<00:01:55.490> snug<00:01:55.970> so

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
pull it out and again it is very snug so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.959 
pull it out and again it is very snug so
it<00:01:56.540> will<00:01:56.750> expand<00:01:57.290> over<00:01:57.530> time<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.670> see

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
it will expand over time and I can see

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.370 
it will expand over time and I can see
why<00:01:59.119> they<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.329> that<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.719> that<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:00.350> know

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
why they do that so that it's you know

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.350 
why they do that so that it's you know
eventually<00:02:00.920> doesn't<00:02:01.850> feel<00:02:02.030> like<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:02.329> just

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
eventually doesn't feel like you just

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.170 
eventually doesn't feel like you just
