00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.640 
my lips so that the purple color will
show<00:03:52.000> up<00:03:52.150> better<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.139> don't<00:03:53.290> have<00:03:53.470> an

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
show up better and I don't have an

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.289 
show up better and I don't have an
actual<00:03:53.769> purple<00:03:54.400> lipstick<00:03:54.849> I<00:03:55.000> find<00:03:55.209> that

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
actual purple lipstick I find that

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.400 
actual purple lipstick I find that
they're<00:03:55.449> pretty<00:03:55.750> difficult<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.169> get<00:03:56.260> your

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
they're pretty difficult to get your

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.809 
they're pretty difficult to get your
hands<00:03:56.560> on<00:03:56.680> unless<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:56.980> want<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.280> spend<00:03:57.639> the

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
hands on unless you want to spend the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.490 
hands on unless you want to spend the
money<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.419> like<00:03:58.599> lum<00:03:58.840> cram<00:03:59.079> or<00:03:59.260> something

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
money for like lum cram or something

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.199 
money for like lum cram or something
like<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.370> I'm<00:04:00.430> just<00:04:00.579> using<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.910> blue

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
like that so I'm just using a blue

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.599 
like that so I'm just using a blue
eyeliner<00:04:01.629> as<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> lip<00:04:02.199> liner<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.769> for<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.370> base

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
eyeliner as a lip liner and for a base

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.460 
eyeliner as a lip liner and for a base
because<00:04:03.940> blue<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.239> pink<00:04:04.359> make<00:04:04.690> purple<00:04:05.139> and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
because blue and pink make purple and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.050 
because blue and pink make purple and
then<00:04:05.949> a<00:04:06.010> lipstick<00:04:06.340> i'm<00:04:06.489> using<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:06.879> like<00:04:07.030> a

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
then a lipstick i'm using is like a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000 
then a lipstick i'm using is like a
magenta<00:04:07.540> color<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.139> when<00:04:08.290> i<00:04:08.319> add<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.709> over<00:04:08.919> the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
magenta color so when i add it over the

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.890 
magenta color so when i add it over the
blue<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.430> really<00:04:09.669> makes<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.940> nice<00:04:10.120> purpley

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
blue it really makes a nice purpley

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.809 
blue it really makes a nice purpley
color<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.799> then<00:04:14.919> I<00:04:15.010> just<00:04:15.159> added<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> fake

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
color so then I just added in a fake

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.060 
color so then I just added in a fake
nose<00:04:16.060> ring<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.690> really<00:04:17.199> look<00:04:17.320> like<00:04:17.380> Perry<00:04:17.769> and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
nose ring to really look like Perry and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.949 
nose ring to really look like Perry and
I<00:04:18.159> curled<00:04:18.519> my<00:04:18.549> hair<00:04:18.639> with<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.909> straightener<00:04:19.389> and

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
I curled my hair with a straightener and

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.990 
I curled my hair with a straightener and
then<00:04:20.409> there's<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.829> look
