00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
towards rhythm playing more and more and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.700 
towards rhythm playing more and more and
really<00:01:04.660> taking<00:01:04.989> pleasure<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:06.149> because

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
really taking pleasure in that because

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.080 
really taking pleasure in that because
I'm<00:01:08.710> going<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.950> talk<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> lot<00:01:09.369> about<00:01:09.430> rhythm

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
I'm going to talk a lot about rhythm

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
I'm going to talk a lot about rhythm
it's<00:01:10.690> become<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:12.100> about<00:01:12.340> my<00:01:12.550> favorite<00:01:12.940> topic

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it's become just about my favorite topic

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.680 
it's become just about my favorite topic
again<00:01:14.979> because<00:01:15.310> it's<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:16.119> just<00:01:16.330> don't<00:01:16.479> hear<00:01:16.630> a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
again because it's you just don't hear a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.540 
again because it's you just don't hear a
lot<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:16.899> strong<00:01:17.590> rhythm<00:01:17.920> playing<00:01:18.130> out<00:01:18.340> there

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
lot of strong rhythm playing out there

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.680 
lot of strong rhythm playing out there
these<00:01:18.700> days<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:20.700> I'd<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:21.849> to<00:01:22.000> turn<00:01:22.179> guitar

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
these days so I'd like to turn guitar

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.100 
these days so I'd like to turn guitar
players<00:01:22.990> attention<00:01:23.349> back<00:01:23.709> towards<00:01:25.110> chords

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
players attention back towards chords

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.859 
players attention back towards chords
and<00:01:26.789> an<00:01:27.789> pockit<00:01:28.450> groove<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.179> I<00:01:31.539> was

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
and an pockit groove so in that I was

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.550 
and an pockit groove so in that I was
playing<00:01:32.140> something<00:01:33.450> remaining<00:01:34.450> rhythm

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.460 

you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.050 

so<00:01:48.230> that's<00:01:49.230> basically<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.830> we<00:01:50.160> need<00:01:50.430> right

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.190 

g7<00:01:53.659> or<00:01:54.049> arrays<00:01:54.500> 9<00:01:55.900> pentatonic<00:01:56.900> scale

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
g7 or arrays 9 pentatonic scale

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.560 
g7 or arrays 9 pentatonic scale
obviously<00:01:57.500> works<00:01:58.040> through<00:01:58.340> all<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.700> and<00:02:01.570> I

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
obviously works through all that and I

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.130 
obviously works through all that and I
want<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.900> show<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.140> some<00:02:03.290> chord<00:02:03.590> voicings

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
want to show you some chord voicings

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.969 
want to show you some chord voicings
did<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.620> use<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> ton<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.730> he<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.830> probably<00:02:08.830> every

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
did I use a ton and he is probably every

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.620 
did I use a ton and he is probably every
guitar<00:02:09.310> players<00:02:09.580> favorite<00:02:10.060> key<00:02:10.270> because<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.300 

sorry<00:02:54.700> there's<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.150> G<00:02:55.390> chord<00:02:55.690> as<00:02:55.810> well<00:02:56.050> right

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.540 

she<00:02:59.550> that<00:03:00.270> kind<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.569> takes<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.959> minor<00:03:01.340> now<00:03:02.340> it's

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
she that kind of takes it minor now it's

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.850 
she that kind of takes it minor now it's
sort<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.849> minor<00:03:03.090> chord<00:03:03.480> instead<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.080> major

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
sort of a minor chord instead of a major

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.280 
sort of a minor chord instead of a major
chord

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
chord

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.800 
chord
but<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:10.590> works<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.069> blues<00:03:11.280> context<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.629> you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
but it works in a blues context if you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.319 
but it works in a blues context if you
play<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:17.010> open<00:03:17.280> strings<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.819> guitar<00:03:17.849> you

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
play the open strings on the guitar you

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:27.150 
play the open strings on the guitar you
