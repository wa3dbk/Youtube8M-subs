last year developing their own personal
point<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.590> view<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.950> sort<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.190> prompt<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
point of view the sort of prompt for the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.780 
point of view the sort of prompt for the
project<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.290> sort<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> design<00:00:37.950> how

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
project was how do we sort of design how

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.130 
project was how do we sort of design how
do<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:38.969> hack<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> urban<00:00:39.570> interior<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.020> sort

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
do we hack the urban interior and sort

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
do we hack the urban interior and sort
of<00:00:40.200> design<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.530> urban<00:00:40.860> intervention<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
of design an urban intervention for the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
of design an urban intervention for the
middle<00:00:42.450> market<00:00:42.780> area<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.500> San<00:00:43.770> Francisco<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
middle market area of San Francisco so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
middle market area of San Francisco so
it's<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.059> these<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.719> layers<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> dialogue

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's this these two layers of dialogue

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's this these two layers of dialogue
between<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.250> physical<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> digital<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
between the physical and the digital and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
between the physical and the digital and
that<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> helped<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> give<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> narrative

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that kind of helped to give a narrative

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580 
that kind of helped to give a narrative
to<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.370> otherwise<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> alien<00:00:51.629> area<00:00:52.500> of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to this otherwise kind of alien area of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
to this otherwise kind of alien area of
the<00:00:52.680> city<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.129> use<00:00:53.460> code<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.270> generate<00:00:54.600> images

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the city I use code to generate images

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.010 
the city I use code to generate images
like<00:00:55.590> interesting<00:00:56.070> images<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:57.960> next

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like interesting images I think my next

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.250 
like interesting images I think my next
step<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> I'd<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.989> turn<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.050> into

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
step that I'd like to do is turn it into

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
step that I'd like to do is turn it into
data<00:01:01.530> visual<00:01:02.250> data<00:01:02.489> using<00:01:03.149> code<00:01:03.390> maybe

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
data visual data using code maybe

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.109 
data visual data using code maybe
something<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.290> interactive<00:01:04.979> than<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
something more interactive than just a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.350 
something more interactive than just a
static<00:01:06.689> image<00:01:07.189> my<00:01:08.189> project<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.939> health

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
static image my project is health

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.350 
static image my project is health
explore<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.960> likes<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> tie

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
explore your likes and it's a way to tie

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.969 
explore your likes and it's a way to tie
your<00:01:12.390> Facebook<00:01:13.400> Likes<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.299> actual<00:01:15.630> body

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
your Facebook Likes to your actual body

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
your Facebook Likes to your actual body
so<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> nice<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.780> seeing<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.140> people

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so it's a nice way of seeing what people

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
so it's a nice way of seeing what people
are<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.710> about<00:01:19.979> before<00:01:20.490> seeing<00:01:20.700> their

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
are all about before seeing their

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
are all about before seeing their
physical<00:01:21.210> appearance<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> could

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
physical appearance and I think it could

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.960 
physical appearance and I think it could
be<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.400> interesting

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
be really interesting

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.719 
be really interesting
you<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.140> had<00:01:25.229> Pecha<00:01:25.470> Kucha<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.549> Pecha

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you just had Pecha Kucha and a Pecha

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
you just had Pecha Kucha and a Pecha
Kucha<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.930> present<00:01:28.350> information

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
Kucha is when you present information

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
Kucha is when you present information
you're<00:01:29.369> given<00:01:30.020> 15<00:01:31.020> slides<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.590> our<00:01:31.740> Pecha

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're given 15 slides so our Pecha

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.850 
you're given 15 slides so our Pecha
Kucha<00:01:32.090> presentations<00:01:33.380> they<00:01:34.380> were<00:01:34.470> presented

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
Kucha presentations they were presented

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
Kucha presentations they were presented
to<00:01:34.950> us<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.369> were<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.970> designers<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> the

their skills one of the things that we
try<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.050> do<00:01:51.230> in<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.410> program<00:01:51.620> is<00:01:51.890> bridge<00:01:52.550> the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
try to do in the program is bridge the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.880 
try to do in the program is bridge the
gap<00:01:53.000> between<00:01:53.030> being<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:53.990> school<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.320> being<00:01:54.650> in

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
gap between being in school and being in

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
gap between being in school and being in
the<00:01:54.980> real<00:01:55.130> world<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.640> that's<00:01:55.730> what

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
the real world and that's what

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.460 
the real world and that's what
internships<00:01:56.420> are<00:01:56.540> all<00:01:56.660> about<00:01:56.930> we<00:01:57.200> want<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
internships are all about we want the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.380 
internships are all about we want the
students<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.800> understand<00:01:58.340> what<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.150> like

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
students to understand what is it like

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.630 
students to understand what is it like
to<00:01:59.690> do<00:01:59.870> your<00:02:00.050> jobs<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.650> every<00:02:01.070> ending<00:02:01.370> every
