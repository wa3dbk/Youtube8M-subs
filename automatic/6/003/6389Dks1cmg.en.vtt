about 70 apps that I use from day to day

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.449 
about 70 apps that I use from day to day
and<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:01.739> we'll<00:03:01.859> go<00:03:01.920> ahead<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.160> run<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> few

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and then we'll go ahead and run a few

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.890 
and then we'll go ahead and run a few
benchmarks<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.389> and<00:03:03.569> see<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
benchmarks on here and see how it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.530 
benchmarks on here and see how it
performs<00:03:04.319> by<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.340> way<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:05.790> handles<00:03:06.239> really

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
performs by the way this handles really

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
performs by the way this handles really
well<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:07.109> nice<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.739> fast<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.430> mouse

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
well it's nice and fast and the mouse

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.420 
well it's nice and fast and the mouse
cursor<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.329> really<00:03:09.660> fluid<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.290> smooth<00:03:10.620> so

just to give you a basic idea where
you're<00:03:25.769> at<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:26.130> got<00:03:26.400> about<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.639> hundred<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
you're at so got about a hundred and

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.750 
you're at so got about a hundred and
earlier<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> got<00:03:28.139> about<00:03:28.290> 120<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:29.340> might've<00:03:29.700> been

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
earlier I got about 120 so might've been

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.339 
earlier I got about 120 so might've been
running<00:03:30.120> something<00:03:30.419> in<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.810> background<00:03:31.200> when

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
running something in the background when

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.370 
running something in the background when
I<00:03:31.380> ran<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.799> test<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.630> finally<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.900> an<00:03:34.139> -

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
I ran this test and finally we have an -

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.920 
I ran this test and finally we have an -
-<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.829> ran<00:03:35.669> it<00:03:35.790> earlier<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.329> got<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.540> score<00:03:36.870> of

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
- I ran it earlier but I got a score of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.069 
- I ran it earlier but I got a score of
14<00:03:37.530> 74<00:03:38.310> which<00:03:38.549> is<00:03:38.579> pretty<00:03:38.940> good<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.419> noticed<00:03:39.989> it

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
14 74 which is pretty good I noticed it

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.569 
14 74 which is pretty good I noticed it
was<00:03:40.169> a<00:03:40.200> little<00:03:40.290> choppy<00:03:40.859> during<00:03:41.190> some<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
was a little choppy during some of the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.640 
was a little choppy during some of the
graphics<00:03:42.030> rendering<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.290> actually

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
graphics rendering but that actually

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.879 
graphics rendering but that actually
gets<00:03:43.829> fixed<00:03:44.310> with<00:03:44.459> Android<00:03:44.870> 4.2.2<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.319> I'll

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
description down below I went ahead and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.159 
description down below I went ahead and
updated<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.410> reco<00:04:13.709> magics<00:04:14.209> 4.2.2<00:04:15.209> ROM<00:04:15.540> it

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
updated this to reco magics 4.2.2 ROM it

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.659 
updated this to reco magics 4.2.2 ROM it
works<00:04:16.380> pretty<00:04:16.650> well<00:04:16.769> but<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.250> got<00:04:17.400> one<00:04:17.549> or

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
works pretty well but it's got one or

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.640 
works pretty well but it's got one or
two<00:04:17.700> bugs<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.389> for<00:04:18.690> example<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.139> desktop

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
two bugs like for example the desktop

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.860 
two bugs like for example the desktop
the<00:04:20.070> icons<00:04:20.459> are<00:04:20.669> slightly<00:04:21.090> off<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.840> have

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
the icons are slightly off so you have

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.480 
the icons are slightly off so you have
to<00:04:22.169> either<00:04:22.260> move<00:04:22.470> them<00:04:22.560> too<00:04:22.710> low<00:04:22.919> or<00:04:23.220> too<00:04:23.250> high

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
to either move them too low or too high

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.110 
to either move them too low or too high
I<00:04:23.970> fix<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.169> by<00:04:25.440> installing<00:04:25.919> Go<00:04:26.190> Launcher<00:04:26.400> HD

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
I fix this by installing Go Launcher HD

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.030 
I fix this by installing Go Launcher HD
which<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:27.630> normally<00:04:27.990> do<00:04:28.110> anyways<00:04:28.560> because<00:04:28.770> it's

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
which I normally do anyways because it's

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.590 
which I normally do anyways because it's
so<00:04:29.160> much<00:04:29.310> easier<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.790> use<00:04:29.820> than<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.330> stock

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
so much easier to use than the stock

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.140 
so much easier to use than the stock
launcher<00:04:30.870> also<00:04:31.440> Netflix<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.460> not<00:04:32.639> working<00:04:33.030> on

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
launcher also Netflix is not working on

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.940 
launcher also Netflix is not working on
this<00:04:33.300> ROM<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.840> know<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.410> will<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.620> fixed<00:04:34.889> soon

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
this ROM I know that will be fixed soon

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.100 
this ROM I know that will be fixed soon
though<00:04:35.310> as<00:04:35.520> soon<00:04:35.940> as<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.090> firmware<00:04:36.389> update<00:04:36.720> that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
though as soon as a firmware update that

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.510 
though as soon as a firmware update that
fixes<00:04:37.380> these<00:04:37.500> issues<00:04:37.800> comes<00:04:38.040> out<00:04:38.160> I'll<00:04:38.280> put<00:04:38.400> it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
fixes these issues comes out I'll put it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.680 
fixes these issues comes out I'll put it
in<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.669> video<00:04:38.760> description<00:04:39.360> down<00:04:39.389> below

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
in the video description down below

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.600 
in the video description down below
other<00:04:40.290> than<00:04:40.620> those<00:04:40.740> two<00:04:40.800> things<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.460> ROM

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
other than those two things the ROM

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.400 
other than those two things the ROM
works<00:04:41.820> pretty<00:04:42.030> well<00:04:42.150> here<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.690> can<00:04:42.870> see<00:04:43.110> that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
works pretty well here you can see that

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.230 
works pretty well here you can see that
it<00:04:43.530> also<00:04:43.680> comes<00:04:43.979> pre<00:04:44.370> rooted<00:04:44.729> which<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.060> nice

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
it also comes pre rooted which is nice

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.700 
it also comes pre rooted which is nice
because<00:04:45.479> some<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> best<00:04:46.020> apps<00:04:46.350> require

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
because some of the best apps require

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.540 
because some of the best apps require
root<00:04:47.070> access

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
root access

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.900 
root access
next<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.630> ran<00:04:48.840> Linpack<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.710> with<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.400> new<00:04:50.610> rom

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
next I ran Linpack and with this new rom

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.730 
next I ran Linpack and with this new rom
it<00:04:51.210> got<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.389> better<00:04:51.630> score<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.320> hundred<00:04:52.620> and

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
it got a better score in the hundred and

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.969 
it got a better score in the hundred and
twenty<00:04:53.040> range<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.729> much<00:04:54.000> nicer<00:04:54.450> there<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.870> -<00:04:55.830> -

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
twenty range so much nicer there and - -

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.010 
twenty range so much nicer there and - -
got<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> better<00:04:56.460> score<00:04:56.820> as<00:04:57.000> well<00:04:57.210> over<00:04:57.510> seven

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
got a better score as well over seven

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.840 
got a better score as well over seven
hundred<00:04:58.050> points<00:04:58.590> higher<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.430> jumping

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
hundred points higher and the jumping

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.400 
hundred points higher and the jumping
