tough<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.320> my<00:00:22.470> processor<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.250> run<00:00:23.600> camstudio

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
tough on my processor to run camstudio

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
tough on my processor to run camstudio
which<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.260> crap<00:00:25.560> by<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.890> by<00:00:26.340> force<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
which is crap by the way by force if you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.109 
which is crap by the way by force if you
have<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> money<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:28.640> also<00:00:29.640> play<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.820> game<00:00:30.029> at

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
have the money and also play the game at

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
have the money and also play the game at
the<00:00:30.150> same<00:00:30.330> time<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.289> instead<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> decided<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.369> do

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the same time so instead I decided to do

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.240 
the same time so instead I decided to do
something<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> little<00:00:32.850> easier<00:00:33.739> on<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.890> computer

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
something a little easier on my computer

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.910 
something a little easier on my computer
so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.420> actually<00:00:36.690> give<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.770> an

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
as reticulating splines that's not true

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.649 
as reticulating splines that's not true
but<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> people<00:01:06.840> stop<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.710> sounded<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.659> so

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
water oops you know tree cover so let's

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.559 
water oops you know tree cover so let's
get<00:01:36.799> something<00:01:37.069> a<00:01:37.130> little<00:01:37.219> moderate<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:38.420> can

this and then you got these tools down
here<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.840> long<00:02:21.139> as<00:02:21.170> you're<00:02:21.380> raised<00:02:21.769> terrain

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
here as long as you're raised terrain

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.370 
here as long as you're raised terrain
and<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.560> lower<00:02:24.799> it<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.900> lets<00:02:27.200> you

and this is to lower it this lets you
raise<00:02:27.650> one<00:02:28.040> point<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.519> time<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.420> lower<00:02:29.569> back

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
raise one point a time and lower back

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.360 
raise one point a time and lower back
down<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.250> evening<00:02:31.760> tool<00:02:32.109> where<00:02:33.109> you
