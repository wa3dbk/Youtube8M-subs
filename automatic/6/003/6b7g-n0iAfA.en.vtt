00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.250
 hello youtube friends today I come with my 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.830
 typical predictions as always so 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 punctual xd and now they are from the event 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.530
 summers slam 2014 which will be the 27th 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 edition of this event will take place 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 on August 17, 2014 in the staples 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.660
 center in los angeles california will be the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 sixth consecutive submersion that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.430
 will take place in the staples center the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 official song of the event will be lights 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.290
 what the fox and this song to me 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.360
 like the official poster of the event the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.250
 I really do not know if it's the one that appears 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.440
 cinema and brock lesnar but I think it 's 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.259
 this if this poster becomes the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.060
 event and I do not like it much until 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.280
 now only four have been confirmed 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.580
 fights which are brock lesnar 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 versus fine jon for the ww championship 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.399
 world heavy stephanie mcmahon versus 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.009
 brief the jack swagger versus rousseff in 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.920
 a fight of flags and finally break 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.810
 wyatt versus crissien and ccoo for how it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 have developed the rivalries in 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 the weekly shows I will give my 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.000
 prediction of all the struggles that I believe 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.120
 that will be given and I think 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.480
 in a 90 I'll be hitting these good 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.070
 now we do start with the predictions 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.500
 the kickoff or prisoner 1 has been confirmed 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.630
 I think it may be the fight between page 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 against aj reads for the championship of the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.650
 divas or it could be the fight between 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.810
 ziggler versus the mid for the championship 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.760
 intercontinental and finally maybe 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.100
 could be the jack swagger against 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.380
 rousseff in this case I will go for the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.240
 fight between my ziggler against this 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 rivalry is given in battleground after 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.380
 win the miss the real battle for the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.630
 intercontinental championship in a way 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 cheat taking out ziggler that was the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.229
 last one that was left and in the raw shows 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.989
 and smackdown have been attacking 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.480
 constantly good my prediction for 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.640
 this fight so it hurts me will be that the mid 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.489
 retain your postdata title 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.890
 mid fucking that I think will be the first 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.780
 fight that is confirmed I think it will be 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.239
 the one of jack swagger against rousseff in 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.130
 a fight of flags this rivalry is 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.500
 has given more or less since about two 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.080
 months ago the rivalry is based on the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 fight between us against russia no 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.860
 I remember if Rousseff and his wife have 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.750
 attacked I think it has only been a 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.720
 microphone rivalry on the part of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.730
 but I really do not know very well my 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.790
 prediction for this fight will be that as 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.770
 the ww is very nationalistic I do not think that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.710
 make rousseff win so winner 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.780
 Marijuana yesterday that I think will be 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.820
 the second fight that is not confirmed 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.410
 for me it would be that of the brothers spindles 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.050
 against the wyatt family by the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.820
 championships in pairs this rivalry is 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.709
 has given more or less for three or 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.660
 four months ago attacking 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.970
 constantly uses and wayapas 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.340
 this time I do believe that we have new 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.250
 champions in pairs my prediction goes 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.350
 for rowan and harper the one that I think will be 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.209
 the third fight that is confirmed 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.730
 for me it would be to brive the contra 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.560
 stephanie mcmann this rivalry I think that 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.810
 is given from the second round after 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.880
 battleground where stephany attacks abri 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.070
 from the microphone and subsequently you 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.900
 gives a slap after stephanie is 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.730
 taken to the police station for the aggression 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 what he did and in the round after this one 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.150
 stephanie tells bree how can 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.190
 make bree remove the legal charges 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.959
 against it what bree responds 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.510
 than having a fight with her in her 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.519
 maryland what stephanie accepts my 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.330
 prediction is that the winner will be short 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.040
 the 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.410
 which I think will be the fourth fight 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.570
 is confirmed for me it would be the one of 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.400
 cristian and co against break wyatt this 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.260
 rivalry is given in the raw after 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.090
 battleground where yericó makes his 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.040
 back but the wyatt family what 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.620
 interrupts and attacks him at the shows 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.490
 weekly these have been attacked 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.770
 constantly and have done some 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.660
 good promos my prediction for this 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.660
 fight is that the evil baron takes 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.520
 the winner victory break away to which 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.620
 I think it will be the fifth fight that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.690
 is confirmed for me it would be the set 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.730
 rollins against dynamo browse this 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.680
 rivalry occurs from the separation of 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.330
 shield and it has been strengthening in the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.550
 weekly shows with constant attacks 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.290
 by both me seem me 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.120
 great to put some 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.340
 stipulation as it was for the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.890
 set briefcase or that it was a fight without 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.080
 disqualification or something like that good my 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.060
 prediction maybe if it becomes a 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.310
 fight that is not for the briefcase is for 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.380
 ambrós but if it is for the briefcase my 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.270
 prediction goes for set although I do not think 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.040
 that the apes of the creatives are 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.540
 happen to put a fight for the briefcase 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.910
 so winner ding ambrose 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.980
 which I think will be the sixth fight that 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.050
 is not confirmed for me it would be the one of 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.450
 aj or against page for the title of the 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.520
 divas this rivalry occurs when aj 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.860
 come back to raw and have a headline fight 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.020
 against page and aj lee is the new 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.750
 champion later this rivalry follows 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.880
 being strange being the two faces and 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.830
 not attacking you until battleground in the 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.680
 round after this event page is 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.540
 He makes rude and just attacking good jo 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.270
 my prediction for this fight is that 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.130
 aguirre has its title which I think 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.080
 will be the seventh fight that is not 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.600
 confirmed in this fight I have two 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.210
 possible battles one could be roman 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.640
 reigns against triple h or one between román 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.560
 reigns against randy orton I think it's 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.810
 will give the roman reigns against randy 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.880
 orton this rivalry I do not remember from 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.010
 how much has been given but it is from 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.500
 about two or three months ago 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.570
 attacking yourself constantly and doing 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.940
 good promos my prediction goes for 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.610
 roman reigns 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.470
 and the last confirmed fight is that of 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.300
 jon china against brock lesnar this 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.220
 rivalry is given when I return to brock 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.830
 although until this date I'm 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.900
 uploading the video have not been attacked for 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.030
 me this fight will be very good although the 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.220
 prediction is something very difficult can 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.470
 have two results for me I will say this 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.690
 before saying my prediction I do not know what 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.840
 may happen since broke comes back for very 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.970
 little time to wwf inos is and this time be 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.980
 same and on the final part the is 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.840
 recording a movie and it's difficult for 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.000
 can appear in the raw shows and 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.820
 smackdown like a champion should do 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.310
 I activate my prediction or rather my 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.080
 two possible requests will be these the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.180
 first is to retain office and 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.610
 copper your set rollins briefcase and the 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.730
 second that I think is more possible is 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.340
 that Brock Lesnar is a good new champion 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.560
 friends these were my predictions 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.980
 dismissal of you until the next 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.980
 goodbye
