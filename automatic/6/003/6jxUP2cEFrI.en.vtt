00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.600 

this<00:00:11.230> simulator<00:00:11.650> really<00:00:11.920> gives<00:00:12.100> you<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:12.340> feel

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
this simulator really gives you a feel

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.480 
this simulator really gives you a feel
for<00:00:12.639> how<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.059> plane<00:00:13.480> flies<00:00:13.930> the<00:00:14.830> idea<00:00:15.100> is<00:00:15.219> to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
for how the plane flies the idea is to

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.429 
for how the plane flies the idea is to
get<00:00:15.670> the<00:00:15.879> students<00:00:16.360> to<00:00:16.390> try<00:00:16.779> and<00:00:16.900> fly<00:00:17.110> designs

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
get the students to try and fly designs

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.769 
get the students to try and fly designs
that<00:00:17.680> they've<00:00:18.160> come<00:00:18.400> up<00:00:18.430> with<00:00:18.520> on<00:00:18.790> their<00:00:18.910> own

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
that they've come up with on their own

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.800 
that they've come up with on their own
very<00:00:20.439> few<00:00:20.770> students<00:00:21.160> ever<00:00:22.060> get<00:00:22.450> to<00:00:22.599> see<00:00:22.750> an

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
very few students ever get to see an

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.090 
very few students ever get to see an
airplane<00:00:22.960> that<00:00:23.140> they<00:00:23.349> designed<00:00:23.680> built<00:00:23.980> and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
airplane that they designed built and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.420 
airplane that they designed built and
flown<00:00:24.340> so<00:00:25.270> they<00:00:25.449> don't<00:00:25.720> get<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.289> learn<00:00:26.500> all<00:00:27.130> of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
flown so they don't get to learn all of

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.250 
flown so they don't get to learn all of
those<00:00:27.580> niggling<00:00:28.210> little<00:00:28.480> details<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:28.960> pop

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
those niggling little details that pop

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.290 
those niggling little details that pop
up<00:00:29.470> in<00:00:29.680> terms<00:00:30.100> of<00:00:30.250> things<00:00:30.670> that<00:00:30.910> maybe<00:00:31.090> they

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
up in terms of things that maybe they

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.090 
up in terms of things that maybe they
haven't<00:00:31.570> quite<00:00:31.750> designed<00:00:32.230> correctly<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
haven't quite designed correctly the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.590 
haven't quite designed correctly the
first<00:00:33.340> time<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:33.580> went<00:00:33.970> into<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.390> flight

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
first time I went into the flight

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.140 
first time I went into the flight
simulator<00:00:35.080> and<00:00:35.290> placed<00:00:36.010> my<00:00:36.250> plane<00:00:36.519> in<00:00:36.699> there<00:00:36.910> I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
simulator and placed my plane in there I

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.509 
simulator and placed my plane in there I
set<00:00:37.960> it<00:00:38.080> on<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.230> runway<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.890> it<00:00:38.980> slowly<00:00:39.400> just

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
set it on the runway and it slowly just

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.119 
set it on the runway and it slowly just
tilted<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.449> then<00:00:40.659> just<00:00:40.870> fell<00:00:41.260> over<00:00:41.680> and<00:00:41.739> I

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
tilted and then just fell over and I

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.920 
tilted and then just fell over and I
realized<00:00:42.699> our<00:00:42.909> landing<00:00:43.239> gear<00:00:43.269> wasn't<00:00:43.750> a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
realized our landing gear wasn't a

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.320 
realized our landing gear wasn't a
crappy<00:00:44.260> place<00:00:44.559> with<00:00:44.920> respect<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.820> Los<00:00:45.970> kind<00:00:46.239> of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
crappy place with respect to Los kind of

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.899 
crappy place with respect to Los kind of
gravity<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.900> plane<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.500> it<00:00:47.650> was<00:00:48.250> very

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
gravity the plane and it was very

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.840 
gravity the plane and it was very
unstable<00:00:49.330> oh<00:00:49.960> there<00:00:50.949> are<00:00:51.010> always<00:00:51.100> surprises<00:00:51.370> I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
unstable oh there are always surprises I

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.450 
unstable oh there are always surprises I
think<00:00:52.030> yeah<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:53.350> take<00:00:53.500> anybody<00:00:53.920> who's<00:00:54.100> used

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
think yeah don't take anybody who's used

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.910 
think yeah don't take anybody who's used
it<00:00:54.580> here<00:00:54.909> so<00:00:55.150> far<00:00:55.360> as<00:00:55.629> has<00:00:56.229> not<00:00:56.379> been<00:00:56.589> surprised

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
it here so far as has not been surprised

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.549 
it here so far as has not been surprised
by<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.190> results<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:57.760> some<00:00:57.970> way<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.409> that

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
by the results in some way and in that

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.920 
by the results in some way and in that
that's<00:01:00.190> normal<00:01:00.400> because<00:01:00.729> you<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.449> only<00:01:01.659> go<00:01:01.750> so

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
that's normal because you you only go so

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.899 
that's normal because you you only go so
far<00:01:02.110> on<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.290> design<00:01:02.530> process<00:01:03.010> in<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.220> class<00:01:03.460> and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
far on the design process in a class and

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.810 
far on the design process in a class and
you<00:01:04.570> can<00:01:04.869> talk<00:01:05.140> about<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.830> put<00:01:06.130> figures<00:01:06.670> on

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
you can talk about it and put figures on

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.000 
you can talk about it and put figures on
the<00:01:06.880> board<00:01:07.119> but<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:07.720> really<00:01:07.930> doesn't<00:01:08.290> give<00:01:08.770> you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
the board but it really doesn't give you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.350 
the board but it really doesn't give you
a<00:01:09.060> grasp<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.360> how<00:01:10.860> planes<00:01:11.860> perform<00:01:12.400> well<00:01:13.180> how

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
a grasp of how planes perform well how

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.940 
a grasp of how planes perform well how
they<00:01:13.510> should<00:01:13.780> perform<00:01:13.930> or<00:01:14.290> why<00:01:14.500> they<00:01:14.740> should

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
they should perform or why they should

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.800 
they should perform or why they should
perform<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.430> way<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.940> integrating<00:01:16.720> this

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
perform that way and integrating this

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.330 
perform that way and integrating this
into<00:01:16.870> classes<00:01:17.470> now<00:01:17.590> we<00:01:17.650> can<00:01:17.860> go<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.040> little<00:01:18.100> bit

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
into classes now we can go a little bit

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.240 
into classes now we can go a little bit
further<00:01:18.580> actually<00:01:19.510> go<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.660> lot<00:01:19.840> further<00:01:20.050> and<00:01:20.710> we

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
further actually go a lot further and we

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.580 
further actually go a lot further and we
can<00:01:21.400> start<00:01:21.610> getting<00:01:21.880> into<00:01:22.090> some<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.720> some

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
can start getting into some of the some

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.200 
can start getting into some of the some
of<00:01:23.710> some<00:01:23.980> of<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.130> trickier<00:01:24.430> light<00:01:24.790> dynamics

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
of some of the trickier light dynamics

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.010 
of some of the trickier light dynamics
of<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.390> airplane

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
of the airplane

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.710 
of the airplane
this<00:01:26.800> flight<00:01:27.520> similar<00:01:27.880> gives<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.480> the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
this flight similar gives you the

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.690 
this flight similar gives you the
opportunity<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.350> take<00:01:29.740> these<00:01:29.920> equations<00:01:30.580> to

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
opportunity to take these equations to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.190 
opportunity to take these equations to
take<00:01:30.880> everything<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.390> learn<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.720> class<00:01:31.930> and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
take everything you learn the class and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.140 
take everything you learn the class and
actually<00:01:32.530> implement<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.490> can<00:01:33.670> sit<00:01:33.880> up<00:01:33.910> at

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
actually implement it you can sit up at

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.760 
actually implement it you can sit up at
the<00:01:34.210> board<00:01:34.390> all<00:01:34.600> day<00:01:34.780> long<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.470> try<00:01:35.650> and

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the board all day long and try and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.110 
the board all day long and try and
explain<00:01:36.010> something<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.460> somebody<00:01:36.700> but<00:01:37.030> then

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
explain something to somebody but then

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.910 
explain something to somebody but then
when<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.300> put<00:01:37.450> them<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.690> cockpit<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.710> you

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
when you put them in the cockpit and you

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.649 
when you put them in the cockpit and you
perturb<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.430> stick<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.210> watch<00:01:40.390> how<00:01:40.600> long

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
perturb the stick and you watch how long

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.100 
perturb the stick and you watch how long
it<00:01:41.200> takes<00:01:41.440> for<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.040> dampen<00:01:42.430> out<00:01:42.690> then<00:01:43.690> you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
it takes for it to dampen out then you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.290 
it takes for it to dampen out then you
understand<00:01:44.680> what<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> damping<00:01:45.820> factor<00:01:45.970> and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
understand what the damping factor and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.480 
understand what the damping factor and
the<00:01:46.360> coefficient<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.320> matrix<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:48.370> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
the coefficient is in that matrix in the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.870 
the coefficient is in that matrix in the
mathematics<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.240> then<00:01:49.330> what<00:01:49.480> it's<00:01:49.630> do

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
mathematics and then what it's do

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.510 
mathematics and then what it's do
the<00:01:50.000> airplane<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.840> simulator<00:01:51.409> takes<00:01:51.710> actual

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the airplane the simulator takes actual

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.179 
the airplane the simulator takes actual
aerodynamic<00:01:53.030> files<00:01:53.390> from<00:01:53.750> testing<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.979> can

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
aerodynamic files from testing and can

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.709 
aerodynamic files from testing and can
implement<00:01:55.460> them<00:01:55.729> into<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> aerodynamics<00:01:56.630> of

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
implement them into the aerodynamics of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.510 
implement them into the aerodynamics of
the<00:01:56.780> airplane<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.469> it's<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:57.920> physics<00:01:58.340> based

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
the airplane so it's it's physics based

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.210 
the airplane so it's it's physics based
it's<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> it's<00:02:00.320> not<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.500> video<00:02:00.710> game<00:02:01.039> it's

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
it's not a it's not a video game it's

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.490 
it's not a it's not a video game it's
based<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:01.579> real<00:02:01.789> physics<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:02.600> doesn't<00:02:02.960> fly<00:02:03.200> if

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
based on real physics it doesn't fly if

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.760 
based on real physics it doesn't fly if
your<00:02:03.740> design<00:02:04.039> doesn't<00:02:04.280> fly<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.960> students

your design doesn't fly the students

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.820 
your design doesn't fly the students
have<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.490> much<00:02:07.759> more<00:02:08.060> profound<00:02:08.360> understanding
