00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
right it's in the app store under

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
right it's in the app store under
speedtest.net<00:00:21.960> as<00:00:22.650> three<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> half<00:00:23.250> stars

I'm<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> keep<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> edge<00:00:56.489> right

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
I'm just going to keep it on edge right

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.590 
I'm just going to keep it on edge right
now<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.539> mean<00:00:58.199> 3g<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.460> i'm<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
now I mean 3g for now so i'm going to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
now I mean 3g for now so i'm going to
start<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.989> test<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> test<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> latency<00:01:04.519> ok

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
start a test for you test the latency ok

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.060 
start a test for you test the latency ok
nevermind<00:01:05.970> i'm<00:01:06.030> doing<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> Wi-Fi<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:08.100> bad

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
nevermind i'm doing a Wi-Fi just my bad

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.359 
nevermind i'm doing a Wi-Fi just my bad
so<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:12.350> wireless<00:01:13.350> internet<00:01:13.950> that's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
so this is my wireless internet that's

so this is my wireless internet that's
the<00:01:14.549> download<00:01:15.000> speed<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.549> getting<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the download speed and getting the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.300 
the download speed and getting the
upload<00:01:17.939> speed<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:21.950> alright<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
upload speed right now alright so that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.940 
upload speed right now alright so that
that's<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> does<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.740> your

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that's what it does right there get your

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.649 
that's what it does right there get your
download<00:01:26.340> speed<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.700> upload<00:01:26.970> speed<00:01:27.299> shows

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
download speed and upload speed shows

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.640 
download speed and upload speed shows
them<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:30.470> let's<00:01:31.470> see

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
them to you right here right let's see

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.399 
them to you right here right let's see
so<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.759> speed<00:01:33.060> test<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.229> have

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so you have the speed test you have

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.280 
so you have the speed test you have
settings<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.750> change<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.530> server

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
settings which you can change the server

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.940 
settings which you can change the server
display<00:01:40.290> speeds<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:42.950> kilobytes

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
display speeds and in kilobytes

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.870 
display speeds and in kilobytes
megabytes<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.090> kilobytes<00:01:45.600> per<00:01:45.689> second<00:01:46.880> you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
megabytes or kilobytes per second you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
megabytes or kilobytes per second you
can<00:01:47.970> sort<00:01:48.119> history<00:01:48.479> by<00:01:48.630> date<00:01:48.899> download<00:01:49.860> speeds

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
can sort history by date download speeds

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.100 
can sort history by date download speeds
or<00:01:50.220> upload<00:01:50.490> speeds<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
or upload speeds and then you have a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
or upload speeds and then you have a
results<00:01:52.649> page<00:01:52.740> where<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> shows<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.149> your

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
results page where it shows you your

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
past results and some of those out there

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.999 
past results and some of those out there
don't<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.960> them<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> 1.67

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
don't know if you can see them the 1.67

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.590 
don't know if you can see them the 1.67
11.95<00:01:59.670> or<00:02:00.290> 3gs<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.799> 3g<00:02:01.950> speeds<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.420> they

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
11.95 or 3gs or 3g speeds and then they

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.499 
11.95 or 3gs or 3g speeds and then they
just<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.869> an<00:02:03.990> about<00:02:04.229> page<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> overall

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
just have an about page so overall

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.010 
just have an about page so overall
goddess<00:02:07.290> apps<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.580> help
