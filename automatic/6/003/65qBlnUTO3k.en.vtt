wake<00:00:03.490> up<00:00:03.790> in<00:00:03.969> the<00:00:04.270> morning<00:00:04.840> and<00:00:05.050> the<00:00:05.319> plants

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:05.770 
wake up in the morning and the plants

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.700 
wake up in the morning and the plants
are<00:00:05.859> so<00:00:06.130> pretty<00:00:06.430> all<00:00:06.729> the<00:00:06.840> parts<00:00:07.840> in<00:00:08.050> the<00:00:08.320> cells

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
are so pretty all the parts in the cells

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.610 
are so pretty all the parts in the cells
function<00:00:09.130> like<00:00:09.670> a<00:00:09.700> small<00:00:10.150> city<00:00:10.620> chlorophyll

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
function like a small city chlorophyll

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.610 
function like a small city chlorophyll
makes<00:00:12.160> them<00:00:12.370> green<00:00:12.700> now<00:00:13.330> that<00:00:13.629> is<00:00:13.900> a<00:00:13.929> fact

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
makes them green now that is a fact

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.640 
makes them green now that is a fact
when<00:00:15.150> photosynthesis<00:00:16.150> occurs<00:00:16.360> you<00:00:17.289> better

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
when photosynthesis occurs you better

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.460 
when photosynthesis occurs you better
step<00:00:18.070> back<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:19.240> a<00:00:19.300> sense<00:00:19.600> mixed<00:00:19.840> up<00:00:20.080> plants

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
step back but a sense mixed up plants

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.330 
step back but a sense mixed up plants
grow<00:00:20.650> go<00:00:21.370> to<00:00:21.430> +<00:00:21.880> h2o<00:00:22.390> our<00:00:22.990> cluster<00:00:23.890> where<00:00:24.160> they

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
grow go to + h2o our cluster where they

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.010 
grow go to + h2o our cluster where they
go<00:00:24.640> down<00:00:25.770> now<00:00:26.770> all<00:00:27.070> they<00:00:27.340> need<00:00:27.610> is<00:00:27.640> energy<00:00:28.330> to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
go down now all they need is energy to

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.600 
go down now all they need is energy to
even<00:00:29.140> light<00:00:29.590> sounds<00:00:29.920> good<00:00:30.100> to<00:00:30.340> me

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
even light sounds good to me

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.829 
even light sounds good to me
we<00:00:31.060> win<00:00:31.360> h2o<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.349> you<00:00:32.439> get<00:00:32.649> a<00:00:32.680> little<00:00:33.600> 80p<00:00:34.600> it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
we win h2o and you get a little 80p it

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.650 
we win h2o and you get a little 80p it
don't<00:00:35.199> stop<00:00:35.649> with<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.160> heart<00:00:36.670> cuz<00:00:37.149> they<00:00:37.390> make

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
don't stop with a heart cuz they make

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.349 
don't stop with a heart cuz they make
their<00:00:37.870> own<00:00:38.079> food<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.670> glucose<00:00:39.670> yeah<00:00:40.089> that's

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
their own food of glucose yeah that's

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.110 
their own food of glucose yeah that's
right<00:00:40.719> all<00:00:41.050> they<00:00:41.350> need<00:00:41.620> is<00:00:41.829> sunlight<00:00:42.640> Oh<00:00:42.999> two

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
right all they need is sunlight Oh two

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.649 
right all they need is sunlight Oh two
for<00:00:43.960> me<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.589> got<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.339> cycle<00:00:45.879> don't<00:00:46.210> stop

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
for me and you got the cycle don't stop

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:53.340 
for me and you got the cycle don't stop
no<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:50.129> don't<00:00:51.129> stop<00:00:51.640> friends<00:00:52.269> are<00:00:52.359> hot<00:00:52.629> as<00:00:53.109> they

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
no it don't stop friends are hot as they

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.069 
no it don't stop friends are hot as they
make<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.829> whole<00:00:54.100> boot<00:00:54.370> up<00:00:54.640> glucose<00:00:55.629> yeah

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
make the whole boot up glucose yeah

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.939 
make the whole boot up glucose yeah
that's<00:00:56.379> right<00:00:56.710> oh<00:00:57.010> baby<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.819> sunlight<00:00:58.659> o2<00:00:59.589> for

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
that's right oh baby the sunlight o2 for

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.630 
that's right oh baby the sunlight o2 for
me<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.609> at<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.059> cycle<00:01:01.839> don't<00:01:02.199> know

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.780 

stomata<00:01:07.600> are<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.350> pores<00:01:08.650> that<00:01:08.740> let<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.310> co2

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
stomata are the pores that let the co2

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.050 
stomata are the pores that let the co2
in<00:01:10.330> water's<00:01:11.320> coming<00:01:11.860> from<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.340> roots<00:01:12.670> while

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
in water's coming from the roots while

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.800 
in water's coming from the roots while
the<00:01:13.330> Sun<00:01:13.630> sinks<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.380> from<00:01:15.340> light<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.820> ATP<00:01:16.360> it

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the Sun sinks in from light to ATP it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.430 
the Sun sinks in from light to ATP it
makes<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.350> reaction<00:01:17.620> go<00:01:18.370> to<00:01:19.090> make<00:01:19.440> c6h12o6

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
makes the reaction go to make c6h12o6

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.600 
makes the reaction go to make c6h12o6
with<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.250> side<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:22.290> let<00:01:23.290> reactions<00:01:23.890> in<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.310> day

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
with a side of let reactions in the day

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.330 
with a side of let reactions in the day
bringing<00:01:25.330> bonds<00:01:25.630> this<00:01:25.840> way<00:01:26.080> okay<00:01:26.620> I'm<00:01:27.100> gonna

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
bringing bonds this way okay I'm gonna

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.320 
bringing bonds this way okay I'm gonna
watch<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.640> o2<00:01:28.090> float<00:01:28.660> up<00:01:28.990> way<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.850> Calvin

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
watch the o2 float up way now the Calvin

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.140 
watch the o2 float up way now the Calvin
cycle<00:01:31.360> comes<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.350> town<00:01:32.620> now<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.160> Sun<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:33.850> going

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
cycle comes to town now the Sun is going

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.570 
cycle comes to town now the Sun is going
down<00:01:34.390> again<00:01:34.930> don't<00:01:35.380> need<00:01:35.620> no<00:01:35.800> light<00:01:36.100> around

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
down again don't need no light around

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.200 
down again don't need no light around
for<00:01:36.910> little<00:01:37.440> fixation<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.860> don't<00:01:39.280> talk<00:01:39.729> with<00:01:40.180> a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
for little fixation it don't talk with a

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
sunlight o2 for me and you got the cycle

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.090 
sunlight o2 for me and you got the cycle
don't<00:01:50.140> stop<00:01:50.650> no<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.729> don't<00:01:55.180> stop<00:01:55.630> my<00:01:56.350> heart<00:01:56.619> cuz

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
don't stop no it don't stop my heart cuz

don't stop no it don't stop my heart cuz
they<00:01:57.369> make<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> whole<00:01:58.090> food<00:01:58.390> up<00:01:58.630> through

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
they make a whole food up through

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.620 
they make a whole food up through
clothes<00:01:59.649> yeah<00:02:00.070> that's<00:02:00.369> right<00:02:00.700> all<00:02:01.030> they<00:02:01.360> need
