you<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.810> noticed<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.529> voice<00:00:22.860> macro<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
people asking for repair max's and the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
tanks most it's max's actually actually

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310

because<00:00:29.369> normally<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.180> tank<00:00:30.600> driver<00:00:30.660> would

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
because normally a tank driver would

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.830 
because normally a tank driver would

thing that people have asked me about

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.310 
thing that people have asked me about
when<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> repair<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> moved<00:01:04.050> while

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
when I repair it's the way I moved while

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
when I repair it's the way I moved while
repairing<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.009> I<00:01:05.280> decided<00:01:05.940> I<00:01:06.090> wanted<00:01:06.270> to

and I make sure that I am NOT standing

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.340 
and I make sure that I am NOT standing
still<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.539> see<00:01:21.660> me<00:01:21.690> walking<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
still and here you see me walking a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.930 
still and here you see me walking a
little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.039> a<00:01:23.130> circle<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
little bit like in a circle like that

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.490 
little bit like in a circle like that
and<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.479> reason<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.840> doing<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.050> is<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.410> make

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and the reason I'm doing this is to make

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
and the reason I'm doing this is to make
sure<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.860> am<00:01:26.099> a<00:01:26.130> moving<00:01:26.580> target<00:01:26.789> for

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
sure that i am a moving target for

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.449 
sure that i am a moving target for
snipers<00:01:28.020> regardless<00:01:28.679> of<00:01:28.830> from<00:01:29.099> what<00:01:29.250> angle

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
snipers regardless of from what angle

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.279 
snipers regardless of from what angle
they<00:01:29.759> might<00:01:29.940> be<00:01:30.060> looking<00:01:30.209> at<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.959> I'm<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
they might be looking at so I'm going to

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.109 
they might be looking at so I'm going to
explain<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.700> point<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:32.940> view<00:01:33.000> of

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
explain this from the point of view of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.820 
explain this from the point of view of
having<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> default<00:01:34.200> settings<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.770> your

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
having the default settings of your

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.710 
having the default settings of your
keyboard<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.209> is<00:01:36.649> wa<00:01:37.649> s<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.640> D<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.179> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
keyboard which is wa s and D and you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.180 
keyboard which is wa s and D and you
just<00:01:39.929> tap<00:01:40.349> your<00:01:40.380> keys<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.340> order<00:01:42.140> wasd

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
just tap your keys in that order wasd

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.680 
just tap your keys in that order wasd
WASD<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.399> speed<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:45.060> process<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
WASD and speed up that process and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.449 
WASD and speed up that process and
eventually<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.709> be<00:01:46.890> moving<00:01:47.039> in<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
eventually you will be moving in a

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.070 
eventually you will be moving in a
circle<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.179> for<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
circle like that for me this is

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.749 
circle like that for me this is
something<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.530> learned<00:01:49.679> years<00:01:50.160> back<00:01:50.459> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
something that I learned years back and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.910 
something that I learned years back and
it's<00:01:50.910> it's<00:01:51.569> just<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.840> reflex<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.349> don't<00:01:52.560> think

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it's it's just a reflex I don't think

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's it's just a reflex I don't think
about<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:53.819> all<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.690> time

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
about it I just do it all the time

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.630 
about it I just do it all the time
people<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.709> asked<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.069> lot<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> questions

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
people have asked a lot of questions

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
people have asked a lot of questions
like<00:01:56.789> what<00:01:56.970> am<00:01:57.060> i<00:01:57.149> doing<00:01:57.420> massaging<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.500> tank

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
like what am i doing massaging the tank

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.249

or<00:01:59.009> whatever<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.580> yeah<00:02:00.539> it<00:02:00.720> might<00:02:00.869> look<00:02:01.050> very

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
or whatever and yeah it might look very

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.229 
or whatever and yeah it might look very
funny<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.739> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> very<00:02:02.250> effective<00:02:02.910> way<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
funny but it is a very effective way of

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.850 
funny but it is a very effective way of
staying<00:02:03.660> away<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:03.929> being<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.319> head<00:02:04.500> shot<00:02:04.709> at

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
staying away from being a head shot at

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.490 
staying away from being a head shot at
by<00:02:05.009> snipers<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.720> might<00:02:06.869> think<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> yeah

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
by snipers and you might think that yeah

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.749 
by snipers and you might think that yeah
but<00:02:07.679> I<00:02:07.709> might<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:07.950> well<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.310> move<00:02:08.459> left<00:02:08.700> and
