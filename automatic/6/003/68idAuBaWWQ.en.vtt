00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
places it'll take some practice just to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.370 
places it'll take some practice just to
get<00:01:51.880> used<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.150> it<00:01:52.270> but<00:01:52.420> got<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.900> most<00:01:53.110> snap

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
get used to it but got it the most snap

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.410 
get used to it but got it the most snap
your<00:01:53.620> wrist<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.570> just<00:01:56.050> using<00:01:56.200> basics<00:01:56.740> G<00:01:57.420> C

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
your wrist so just using basics G C

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:10.520 
your wrist so just using basics G C
adenine<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.620> D<00:01:59.890> chord

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.980 

so<00:02:11.530> that's<00:02:11.950> pretty<00:02:12.190> basic<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.700> lot<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.750> people

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so that's pretty basic a lot of people

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.120 
so that's pretty basic a lot of people
can<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.350> but<00:02:14.620> if<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.740> really<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.070> to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
can do that but if you really want to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.430 
can do that but if you really want to
kick<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.640> notch<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.690> you'll<00:02:16.840> learn<00:02:17.380> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
kick it up a notch what you'll learn to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.060 
kick it up a notch what you'll learn to
do<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:18.060> when<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> slap<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:20.290> know<00:02:20.380> flick<00:02:20.800> out

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
do is when you slap you know flick out

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.030 
do is when you slap you know flick out
your<00:02:21.520> index<00:02:21.850> finger<00:02:22.150> at<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> same<00:02:22.720> time<00:02:23.040> so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
your index finger at the same time so

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.290 
your index finger at the same time so
what<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.460> get<00:02:24.700> is

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300

strumming all right and what that allows
you<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.210> do<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.930> get<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.200> percussive

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
you to do is you get that percussive

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.140 
you to do is you get that percussive
sound<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.430> playing<00:02:45.670> notes<00:02:45.880> at<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
sound and you're playing notes at the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.490 
sound and you're playing notes at the
same<00:02:46.360> time<00:02:46.600> which<00:02:46.870> opens<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.230> lot<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.410> doors

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
same time which opens a lot of doors

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.490 
same time which opens a lot of doors
doing<00:02:48.130> some<00:02:48.250> cool<00:02:48.430> stuff<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.480> let's<00:02:50.200> try<00:02:50.440> doing

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
doing some cool stuff so let's try doing

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.650 
doing some cool stuff so let's try doing
an<00:02:50.950> alternating<00:02:51.340> bass<00:02:51.550> line<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> 6th<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
an alternating bass line on the 6th and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.980 
an alternating bass line on the 6th and
the<00:02:52.780> 5th<00:02:53.020> string<00:02:53.350> with<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.250> slap<00:02:55.120> flick<00:02:55.720> in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
the 5th string with the slap flick in

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:04.720 
the 5th string with the slap flick in
between

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.449 

alright<00:03:05.730> next<00:03:06.269> step<00:03:06.390> you're<00:03:06.780> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> add

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
alright next step you're going to add

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.410 
alright next step you're going to add
playing<00:03:08.459> with<00:03:08.579> either<00:03:08.700> your<00:03:08.909> middle<00:03:09.060> finger

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
playing with either your middle finger

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.080 
playing with either your middle finger
or<00:03:09.599> your<00:03:09.750> ring<00:03:10.170> finger<00:03:10.950> maybe<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.549> higher<00:03:11.790> note

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
or your ring finger maybe a higher note

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.360 
or your ring finger maybe a higher note
like<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> first<00:03:13.049> or<00:03:13.200> second<00:03:13.530> string<00:03:13.799> at

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
like on the first or second string at

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.720 
like on the first or second string at
the<00:03:14.549> same<00:03:14.730> time<00:03:14.939> as<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> bass<00:03:15.360> note<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.870> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.790 

you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.490 

okay<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.570> basis<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:28.960> stuff<00:03:29.380> like

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
okay and that's the basis for stuff like

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:41.789 
okay and that's the basis for stuff like
blackboard<00:03:30.100> by<00:03:30.430> Paul<00:03:30.640> McCartney<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:31.330> goes

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.899 

um<00:03:42.799> there's<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.280> little<00:03:43.370> bit<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.640> extra

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
um there's a little bit of extra

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.880 
um there's a little bit of extra
technique<00:03:44.329> on<00:03:44.450> some<00:03:44.629> of<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.900> those<00:03:45.500> different

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
technique on some of the those different

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.530 
technique on some of the those different
fingerings<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:47.090> basic<00:03:47.450> stuff

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.420 

all<00:03:51.080> right<00:03:51.260> they<00:03:51.560> actually<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.010> slapping

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
all right they actually do the slapping

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.699 
all right they actually do the slapping
motion<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.989> song<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.260> see<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> lot<00:03:54.680> of

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
motion and that that song I see a lot of

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.770 
motion and that that song I see a lot of
people<00:03:54.799> playing

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
people playing

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.620 
people playing
which<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.620> fine<00:03:57.800> but<00:03:58.100> it's<00:03:58.250> actually<00:03:58.550> slapping

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
which is fine but it's actually slapping

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.780 
which is fine but it's actually slapping
um<00:04:01.050> maybe<00:04:01.830> I'll<00:04:01.950> do<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.100> tutorial<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.730> that

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
um maybe I'll do a tutorial on that

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.059 
um maybe I'll do a tutorial on that
later<00:04:03.690> anyway<00:04:04.470> moving<00:04:04.800> on<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.790> we've<00:04:06.060> got

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.509 

next<00:04:11.879> step<00:04:12.060> after<00:04:12.239> we<00:04:12.689> do<00:04:13.140> our<00:04:13.519> simultaneous

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
next step after we do our simultaneous

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.939 
next step after we do our simultaneous
slap<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.450> flick<00:04:15.689> we're<00:04:16.320> going<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.500> lift<00:04:16.680> up

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
slap and flick we're going to lift up

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.640 
slap and flick we're going to lift up
with<00:04:17.669> our<00:04:17.910> index<00:04:18.419> finger<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.380> we're<00:04:19.500> going<00:04:19.590> to

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
with our index finger so we're going to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.370 
with our index finger so we're going to
do<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> slap<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.329> strum<00:04:21.690> down<00:04:21.840> at<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.229> same

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
do a slap and strum down at the same

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.230 
do a slap and strum down at the same
time<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:23.220> we're<00:04:23.310> going<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.460> strum<00:04:23.699> up<00:04:23.880> with

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
time then we're going to strum up with

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.790 
time then we're going to strum up with
index<00:04:24.570> finger<00:04:24.870> so

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.029 

okay<00:04:32.520> get<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.910> alternate<00:04:33.330> base<00:04:33.509> going

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.100 

and<00:04:39.460> then<00:04:39.580> get<00:04:39.759> the<00:04:39.879> melody<00:04:40.180> going<00:04:40.539> with<00:04:40.900> the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and then get the melody going with the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.350 
and then get the melody going with the
top<00:04:41.499> string<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.069> what<00:04:42.909> we're<00:04:43.059> going<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.210> try

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
top string and what we're going to try

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.049 
top string and what we're going to try
do<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:44.110> make<00:04:44.259> it<00:04:44.439> sort<00:04:45.099> of<00:04:45.189> rhythmically

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:46.059 
do to make it sort of rhythmically

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:47.879 
do to make it sort of rhythmically
interesting<00:04:46.629> so<00:04:47.319> we're<00:04:47.439> gonna<00:04:47.529> play<00:04:47.710> them

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
interesting so we're gonna play them

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.100 
interesting so we're gonna play them
together<00:04:48.219> on<00:04:48.699> the<00:04:48.969> first<00:04:49.180> time<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:49.629> bass<00:04:49.839> note

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
together on the first time so bass note

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.829 
together on the first time so bass note
and<00:04:50.319> the<00:04:50.469> high<00:04:50.589> string<00:04:50.889> together<00:04:51.659> then<00:04:52.659> just

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:52.839 
and the high string together then just

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:55.330 
and the high string together then just
do<00:04:53.589> this<00:04:53.770> pattern

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
do this pattern

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.760 
do this pattern
alright<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> first<00:04:56.270> half<00:04:56.600> is<00:04:58.360> alright

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.129 

then<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.460> second<00:05:02.849> half<00:05:03.060> when<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.930> do<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
then the second half when you do the

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.050 
then the second half when you do the
other<00:05:04.289> base<00:05:04.560> note<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.430> on<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.610> fifth<00:05:05.819> string

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
other base note so on the fifth string

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.360 
other base note so on the fifth string
now<00:05:06.500> but<00:05:07.500> we're<00:05:07.800> not<00:05:07.919> going<00:05:08.069> to<00:05:08.099> play<00:05:08.220> it

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
now but we're not going to play it

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.770 
now but we're not going to play it
together<00:05:08.699> with<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.150> high<00:05:09.270> string<00:05:09.599> we're
