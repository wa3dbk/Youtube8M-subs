basically they've gone through their
lives<00:03:04.080> everything<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.740> just<00:03:04.890> sort<00:03:05.100> of

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
lives everything is just sort of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.800 
lives everything is just sort of
happened<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:05.760> essentially<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.390> sort<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
happened but essentially that sort of

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.470 
happened but essentially that sort of
union<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.350> matrimony<00:03:07.860> did<00:03:08.520> not<00:03:08.700> happen<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.360> it

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
union of matrimony did not happen for it

is<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.020> complicated<00:03:10.470> plot<00:03:11.010> get<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:11.880> not

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
is a very complicated plot get it's not

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.330 
is a very complicated plot get it's not
wiping<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.870> out<00:03:12.960> like<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.410> was<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> dream<00:03:13.980> but
