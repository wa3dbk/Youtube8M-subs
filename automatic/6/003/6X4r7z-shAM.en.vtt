item that we have here is from Duvall
engineering<00:05:57.330> some<00:05:58.330> radiator<00:05:58.750> guards<00:05:59.620> and

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
engineering some radiator guards and

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.100 
engineering some radiator guards and
braces<00:06:00.240> similar<00:06:01.240> to<00:06:01.420> what<00:06:01.600> we<00:06:01.690> already<00:06:01.990> have

on<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.320> bike<00:06:02.530> these<00:06:03.280> will<00:06:03.490> also<00:06:03.820> create<00:06:04.270> like

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
on the bike these will also create like

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.530 
on the bike these will also create like
a<00:06:04.540> cage<00:06:05.250> around<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.580> radiator<00:06:06.970> to<00:06:07.060> protect

them<00:06:07.690> from<00:06:07.870> being<00:06:08.250> bent<00:06:09.250> or<00:06:09.640> twisted<00:06:09.960> but

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
them from being bent or twisted but

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.070 
them from being bent or twisted but
what's<00:06:11.170> unique<00:06:11.290> about<00:06:11.590> these<00:06:11.920> is<00:06:11.980> they<00:06:12.250> have<00:06:12.460> a

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
what's unique about these is they have a

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.380 
what's unique about these is they have a
aluminum<00:06:14.400> screen<00:06:15.400> or<00:06:15.670> not<00:06:15.700> aluminum<00:06:16.150> screen

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
aluminum screen or not aluminum screen

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.990 
aluminum screen or not aluminum screen
but<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.600> grade<00:06:16.990> type<00:06:17.920> protection<00:06:18.580> which

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
but a grade type protection which

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.150 
but a grade type protection which
replaces<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:19.780> actual<00:06:20.290> plastic<00:06:22.230> louver<00:06:23.230> so

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
replaces the actual plastic louver so

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.020 
replaces the actual plastic louver so
this<00:06:24.280> would<00:06:24.400> be<00:06:24.460> a<00:06:24.490> little<00:06:24.610> more<00:06:24.730> better

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
this would be a little more better

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.460 
this would be a little more better
protection<00:06:25.570> for<00:06:25.720> the<00:06:25.780> front<00:06:26.050> of<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.170> radiator

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
protection for the front of the radiator

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.300 
protection for the front of the radiator
and<00:06:26.710> also<00:06:26.980> good<00:06:27.250> crash<00:06:27.640> crash<00:06:28.240> protection<00:06:28.600> for

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
and also good crash crash protection for

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.560 
and also good crash crash protection for
side<00:06:30.310> impacts<00:06:31.000> and<00:06:31.150> things<00:06:31.330> of<00:06:31.420> that<00:06:31.510> nature

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
side impacts and things of that nature

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.680 
side impacts and things of that nature
so<00:06:32.020> we<00:06:32.140> will<00:06:32.740> get<00:06:32.830> those<00:06:33.040> on<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.310> bike<00:06:33.600> kind<00:06:34.600> of

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
so we will get those on the bike kind of

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.360 
so we will get those on the bike kind of
switch<00:06:34.990> in<00:06:35.230> and<00:06:35.320> out<00:06:35.410> see<00:06:35.740> which<00:06:35.860> ones<00:06:36.100> we<00:06:36.220> like
