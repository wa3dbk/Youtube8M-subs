this one is like the actual one and then

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
this one is like the actual one and then
good<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.450> could<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.840> his

good and then like you could see his
face<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.970> figure<00:01:42.450> like

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
face not that big of a figure like

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.230 
face not that big of a figure like
compared<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.759> compared<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.970> bull's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
compared to this like compared to bull's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.910 
compared to this like compared to bull's
eye<00:01:48.509> he's<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.530> lunch<00:01:51.409> maybe<00:01:52.409> 2<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:52.890> 4<00:01:53.340> inches

eye he's about lunch maybe 2 or 4 inches

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.959 
eye he's about lunch maybe 2 or 4 inches
so<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.630> wouldn't<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.840> recommend<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.969> but

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
so I wouldn't really recommend this but

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
so I wouldn't really recommend this but
all<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> really<00:02:00.750> does<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.890> lift

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
all that really does was just like lift

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.160 
all that really does was just like lift
pencils<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.710> when<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> go<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.750> well<00:02:06.750> like

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
