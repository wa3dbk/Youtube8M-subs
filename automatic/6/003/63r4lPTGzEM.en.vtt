00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
veranda on the back I've actually have

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.180 
veranda on the back I've actually have
another<00:03:38.819> one<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.359> you<00:03:40.199> can<00:03:40.349> see<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.739> inside

detailing even for back then years later
I<00:03:45.690> think<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:46.290> 70s<00:03:46.829> they<00:03:47.340> actually<00:03:47.669> came

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
I think in the 70s they actually came

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.020 
I think in the 70s they actually came
out<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> different<00:03:49.760> casting<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:50.909> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
out with a different casting but the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.719 
out with a different casting but the
same<00:03:51.269> idea<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.829> can<00:03:53.010> see<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.370> interior

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
same idea and you can see the interior

00:03:53.729 --> 00:04:02.379 
same idea and you can see the interior
what<00:03:54.209> cracks<00:03:54.510> me<00:03:54.720> up<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:55.729> that<00:03:56.729> they<00:03:57.540> have<00:04:01.129> the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
what cracks me up is that they have the

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.030 
what cracks me up is that they have the
doorway<00:04:03.389> doesn't<00:04:04.049> actually<00:04:04.379> line<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.680> with

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
doorway doesn't actually line up with

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.460 
doorway doesn't actually line up with
the<00:04:05.159> door<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:05.579> on<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:06.060> but<00:04:06.389> anyways<00:04:07.260> it's

the door with on this but anyways it's

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.530 
the door with on this but anyways it's
neat<00:04:07.680> casting<00:04:08.220> also<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.819> center<00:04:09.120> comes<00:04:09.359> out
