00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.069
 everyone today we find ourselves 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.280
 in a new video and we will talk 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.230
 perfect fruit so why and 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.620
 perfect fee why do they have this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.470
 aspect this form and then here is where 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.720
 so I must know that a tree a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.990
 fresh perfect a ca is not at all 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 the city corners apart if we have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 plant from the beginning of the game 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.320
 so let's start with the basics when 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.310
 I started the game I had a fair one 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.900
 only fruit of my city 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 so this is the original fruit of my 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.180
 city ​​that was pear and a moment 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.090
 I saw a tree with a pretty pear 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 weird in water and pear normal in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.670
 down I told myself earth it must be in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200
 more expensive and so it's frozen sold but 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.260
 I should never have done that because it's 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 a perfect one and if I did it if I 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.469
 the plains you are but I will have full 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 free perfect trees etc etc 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.850
 to discover and find sub money so 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.940
 so here is all the beginners 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.590
 I advise you as soon as you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 start to marty if you see a cool 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.580
 perfect in your city do not sell 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.530
 you're planting with a shovel every 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.920
 sentences walking n 1 north by money 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.590
 normally speaking so mostly planted the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.630
 to discover and then also to 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.790
 a few times you read under 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.540
 So here we go 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 that's so nobody has the free menu 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.740
 of original there can be pears 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.659
 like me or the cherries or the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 fisheries so that's personal to the same 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 fruit so that's pretty good then 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 on the other hand if you have in the life of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.689
 someone who gives you his fee by 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.750
 done because there is nice or 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.970
 give one of these costs perfect for that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 you make it to collection etc do not 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.600
 do not plant because it's not okay 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.780
 to walk is not the same fruit as 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.470
 your city as your frédo the standby 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.110
 original 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 well it will not be a tree near by 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.100
 does his ad will be a normal free tree 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.969
 so not even if you give me a fishing 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.460
 perfect that I plant it and well it's me 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.200
 make a normal fishing tree here 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.300
 so that's what's pretty bad 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 it's like can plant other fees 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.629
 perfect so 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.450
 I have plenty in the offer is perfect 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.200
 I can not do everything 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.700
 so if so as I said it must 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.939
 not planted with a perfect free wine 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.079
 other cities it does not work it does not 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.420
 do not have to sell the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.340
 perfect fruit as long as we do not have 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.930
 others finally it's advice after 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.030
 you do what you want 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.549
 but that's when I advise you 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.909
 really to plant them two ways in 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.819
 have a lot more that can use them 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.659
 one more thing there is a defined number 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.519
 to shake the tree 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.019
 when you shake the tree here you are 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.030
 retrieve their fruits where you go and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.609
 22 you are going to plant them but especially 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 I think I do not remember if 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.810
 shake the tree more than five times 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.239
 after he will become dead and you go 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.579
 have a rotten fruit that will fall more 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.620
 two other fees perfect so that's it 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.359
 I learned it like that I shook mona 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.849
 my tree for power has still planted 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.099
 perfect fruit trees he has all 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.099
 the leaves fell there was a 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.870
 ripe pear and perfect pear so 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.489
 I waited to see if it will push 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.409
 it does not rocks so do not know so 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.269
 I was pretty listened but hey I'm going 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.780
 cut with an ax and generous but at 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.229
 the place 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.239
 so here's so do try try to 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.280
 shake the tree to free perfect the least 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.659
 many times to be able to keep it 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.199
 like that if you want to keep the 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.180
 decoration 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.919
 me that's what I do a e respect 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.500
 of a decoration or really when I 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.180
 need to blow this shot but 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.099
 I use the beetle method more 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.079
 here it is it was a pretty video 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.389
 short to talk to you about fruits 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:52.699
 perfect so it's tony not recommended any 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:56.090
 so that's so I'm recapping then 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.379
 especially do not plant the perfect fresh do not 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.189
 sell them is not that advice 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.780
 you do what you want do not 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.879
 do not know too much cold the tree to free 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.789
 perfect because otherwise he will become 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.229
 dead and especially that rotten fruit to 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.129
 you can not sell it to cherry 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:16.489
 Latin you are obliged to country and 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.989
 thirdly do not plant another 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.969
 perfect fruit than your life 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.260
 original it will not be a tree a 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:23.570
 perfect fruit it will make a 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.130
 free normal that's it's all for 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.470
 this video will be in a 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.650
