00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
turn focused all the way back but let's

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.809 
turn focused all the way back but let's
say<00:03:48.720> we're<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.500> really<00:03:49.769> chatty<00:03:50.160> server<00:03:50.519> just

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
say we're in a really chatty server just

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.309 
say we're in a really chatty server just
like<00:03:50.940> right<00:03:51.329> now<00:03:51.540> where<00:03:51.810> there's<00:03:51.989> chat

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
like right now where there's chat

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.009 
like right now where there's chat
flowing<00:03:52.680> all<00:03:52.859> over<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.220> time<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.970> can<00:03:54.569> turn

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
flowing all over the time I can turn

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.400 
flowing all over the time I can turn
unfocused<00:03:55.829> down<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.359> shows<00:03:57.630> much

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
unfocused down so that it shows much

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.759 
unfocused down so that it shows much
less<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.880> scrolling<00:04:00.450> chat<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.470> is

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
less of the scrolling chat this is

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.589 
less of the scrolling chat this is
really<00:04:02.250> really<00:04:02.579> really<00:04:02.970> useful

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
really really really useful

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.530 
really really really useful
finally<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.410> width<00:04:04.799> if<00:04:05.069> it's<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:06.060> too<00:04:06.269> wide

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
finally is width if it's just too wide

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.569

of<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.930> chat<00:04:07.169> you<00:04:07.349> can<00:04:07.560> turn<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:08.010> down<00:04:08.250> and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
of a chat you can turn this down and

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.140 
of a chat you can turn this down and
squeeze<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.510> over<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.889> side<00:04:11.160> now<00:04:11.730> most

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
squeeze it over to the side now most

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.509 
squeeze it over to the side now most
