00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:12.690
 and I had that it was a great match and 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.610
 we could pass to a rival of much 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.430
 hierarchy and up much care already 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.619
 that we have live good percent 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.419
 little wonder what it means to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.160
 center because at the beginning of the canvas or 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.290
 in the restart of the season better 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 said he got a triumphant up and 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.520
 he did not say that somehow he 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 He had a thorn after 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.860
 what had happened in the monumental by 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.589
 the championship 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.680
 I want to ask you your evaluation of this 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:43.080
 and if you think more or less the same 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.010
 well I say it's a story 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.720
 different 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.540
 santiago another party 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.380
 there were different players so that's 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.160
 the story I repeat again 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.250
 after he left out above 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.580
 a competition is not easy 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.670
 has great players a 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.630
 coach 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 and I'll stick with that later 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.509
 I would like to do a much more analysis 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.689
 fine surely with the time of 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:20.729
 I work but I am very happy very 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.530
 happy with people over all 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.970
 things for these players 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:31.540
 it was very well they make a great effort 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.540
 well I see a great field team 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.280
 for soria he did work the moment 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.910
 party was made hard he got more eggs 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.490
 expulsions 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:50.290
 you spoke at this time you spoke to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.680
 that do not give themselves to subscribe a drive 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.130
 for is not that to live in it that's why 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.440
 then the change of salazar immediately 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.650
 when we slept that was connected and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.170
 had two plays where he did not compete 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.640
 one in a normal way taking out the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.620
 leg to take care then good 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.310
 We decided to make a change soon 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.170
 it 's a tough game because it's a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.150
 eliminatory match as we talk in the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.740
 previous 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.530
 all the boxes as what I 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.640
 so I do not repeat it again and I'm 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.220
 happy for my players for the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.480
 people for everything that we have been working 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 and surely we have things to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.300
 correct but it's always easier 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.820
 correcting winning did not eliminate it up 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.980
 that generates a particular joy 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.410
 it costs a lot historically central earns 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.300
 where up in the statistics has been 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.700
 mark but in the second time the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.240
 reverse costs team up with two more 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.040
 and he was very worried about that he has 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.780
 central passage and if there was merit of rivers 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.860
 by the marine river you marked it but 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.720
 what happened to central 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.580
 but 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.180
 it seems to me at least what I give them 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.490
 asked was that they give amplitude to the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.770
 figure system that 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.940
 it's good that how many more men are going 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.280
 against that way much more 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.170
 Slow down and give you peace of mind sometimes 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.050
 when he sees the spaces he lets 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.570
 very fast the golf ball by decision 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.100
 in a specialized way and it's a 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.360
 contagious sport when I was a 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.840
 computer were three 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.220
 it costs you and then it seems to me that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.230
 idea would have been to reduce the line 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.800
 forward not every time I grabbed 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.910
 the ball to river back but good 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.860
 today the truth that important passarella 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.860
 we have time to correct 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.110
 and well then we are going to do it but 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.930
 He also ruled out that we counted 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.600
 we played a great game 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.400
 before a major opponent then it 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.170
 activity returns to work and much 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.170
 but we are very happy
