one thing with rollers to keep in mind

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.820 
one thing with rollers to keep in mind
as<00:00:15.059> far<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:15.630> thickness<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.139> roller<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.680> do

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
as far as what thickness of roller to do

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.019 
as far as what thickness of roller to do
is<00:00:17.119> that<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:19.170> thicker<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.890> roller<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
is that the thicker the roller the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.870 
is that the thicker the roller the
heavier<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.990> texture<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> pain<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.519> if

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
heavier the texture of the pain so if

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.870 
heavier the texture of the pain so if
you've<00:00:24.029> got<00:00:24.060> walls<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.859> very<00:00:26.369> rough

like<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> concrete<00:00:28.380> wall<00:00:28.699> then<00:00:29.699> you'll<00:00:30.000> use<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
like a concrete wall then you'll use a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
like a concrete wall then you'll use a
thicker<00:00:30.539> roller<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.439> Mabel<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> pain

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
thicker roller so you Mabel get the pain

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.389

in<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.840> smoother<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> finish<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in there the smoother the finish the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.000 
in there the smoother the finish the
shorter<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> nap<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> 38<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.620> kind<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
shorter the nap but the 38 is kind of a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.639 
shorter the nap but the 38 is kind of a
standard<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> works<00:00:39.149> best<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:40.079> painting

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.190 
about two and a half inches up the wall
and<00:01:33.920> then<00:01:34.920> once<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.780> that<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.930> allow

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and then once we do that that will allow

and then once we do that that will allow
us<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.610> take<00:01:38.610> our<00:01:38.820> roller<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.220> as<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.490> see

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
us to take our roller and as you can see

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880 
us to take our roller and as you can see
our<00:01:41.670> roller<00:01:42.060> will<00:01:42.299> come<00:01:42.540> down<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> before

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
our roller will come down and before

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010 
our roller will come down and before
hitting<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> counter<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hitting down here on the counter we can

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.859 
hitting down here on the counter we can
get<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.320> two<00:01:46.680> inches<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.399> counter

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
get about two inches from that counter

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
get about two inches from that counter
so<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> first<00:01:49.229> thing<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.159> we

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so the first thing we want to do is we

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
so the first thing we want to do is we
want<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.700> work<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.509> an<00:01:51.630> area<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
