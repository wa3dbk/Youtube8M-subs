 cognitive rubric which 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.710
 called from those on the facts of this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 section I lead channel Dmitry pink 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 on youtube I will tell you about the most 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 interesting historical and not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.589
 historical facts about gadgets 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 and modern technologies and in some 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.809
 interesting stories of creating modern 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.249
 gadgets about the forerunners of modern 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.730
 technological advances 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:52.320
 as well as just about interesting facts and 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.899
 features of modern gadgets 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.719
 gadgets that you can now 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.530
 hold your hands but about these features 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.210
 or opportunities probably do not know in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 general in this section I will tell 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.380
 you about everything related to interesting 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 facts about modern technology 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.240
 but what we start in today's first 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.490
 the release of this new project we 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.650
 talk to you about the present 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.230
 predecessors of modern factories and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.400
 some small tablets from 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.220
 far distant past by the way who not 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
 knows phablet is a big smartphone or 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.470
 small tablet with the possibility 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.810
 making calls and sending messages 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 via sim card and so very real 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 ancestor of modern phablets 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.820
 and some tablets is really 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.320
 business is not samsung galaxy inside and not ipad 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.400
 first generation how could you 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.450
 to guess 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.200
 and still very very old device 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.750
 do not believe what year distant 90 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.400
 and don't believe which apple company 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 The first model of such a device was 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.540
 released to apple far in 1993 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.330
 year and the first model of this gadget 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.800
 called apple 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.380
 utan with touchpad vaguely reminiscent 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.880
 today's galaxy laptop 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.460
 externally, this device looked like 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.860
 thick laptop computer 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.790
 the stylus that went into the body of this 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.030
 devices 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.890
 as well as a black and white screen in general 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.560
 to journalists this device is quite 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.470
 liked but sold frankly 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.890
 saying bad because it cost both 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.890
 country house batteries ate packs 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.530
 but with their responsibilities could not cope 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.650
 by the way, and handwriting there was very 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.190
 clumsy so newton sometimes did not understand 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.530
 what's there to prick if after the first 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.870
 Apple version of this gadget 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.190
 continued to release all new and new 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.020
 version of this outstanding gadget and to 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.450
 unfortunately in the month of November 1997 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:16.220
 Apple has released the latest model of this. 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.459
 devices and already 1998 returned to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.459
 Jobs has finally closed this 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.130
 project but probably thank god because 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.500
 that the current ipad we probably would not 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.620
 saw at least in this form 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.250
 which he now has on the market would be 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.340
 any 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.370
 modern similarity of this apple in newton 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.450
 messagepad and no neatly in 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.620
 ipad to 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.750
 now finish with apple newton with hp not 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.330
 a successful prototype of modern 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.300
 tablets and phablet ok and little by little 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.180
 go to the creation of the first tablet 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.750
 computer from apple ipad 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.230
 it's glitchy in the eighth year some steve 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.900
 jobs 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.769
 probably you know him i think so 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.209
 I lay in a hospital bed extremely robust design 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.370
 and already in 2009 being sick he gave 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.120
 OK to develop tablet 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.060
 apple ipad computer that he 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.310
 standards was supposed to be working on mobile 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.810
 ios version which was for the first time 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.330
 presented on 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.210
 apple iphone 2g i.e. first generation 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.940
 iphone but unfortunately then it is not yet 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.690
 It called as ios and it was not 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.870
 no appstore or aytyuns were 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.419
 some kind of third-party applications which 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.400
 could be set using 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.280
 jailbreak and jailbreak on the first iphone 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.380
 h70 was made and in steps 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.350
 which you have to do on your own 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.419
 windows or mac computer and in general 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.790
 let 's do this jailbreak and come back 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.530
 to ipad actually when apple 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.540
 thought develops its new 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.520
 apple ipad tablet computer 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.020
 they ran into some problem 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.080
 put either 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.620
 new their not chip which was called then 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.580
 apple a4 either put the chip from the company 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.280
 intel but 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.389
 intel processor they did not deliver 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.729
 one simple reason and 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.639
 a cooler was needed for this processor 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.190
 the cooler is a fan that is built into 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.250
 block your personal computer 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.970
 or laptop and you know if 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.490
 build fan in apple ipad case 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.850
 even the first generation he would 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.430
 extremely fat this time the authors buzzed 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.660
 would be like abnormal and charge enough 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.830
 not for 10 hours 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.020
 at least 5 of course I like 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.360
 to the consumer it is frankly not 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.880
 I would like it and people will not 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.740
 it seems it would not take you and 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.840
 so apple 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.740
 finally refused services 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.120
 Intel processor with the possibility of it 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.090
 cooler cooling it sure would be 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.550
 bad and the apple company went to the victim 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.850
 but reasonable by releasing your first 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.979
 a processor called apple a4 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.919
 I recall it was one core and so that is 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.870
 this and at 800 megahertz it was very 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.539
 weak processor but for mobile 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.160
 devices of the tenth year it was quite 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:21.919
 not bad and that's when the tenth year 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.110
 apple released this device you know 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.650
 in fact, the press did not recognize it 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.160
 built and said that the sale is not 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.050
 Letters will be small, but then later 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.020
 people under hot and 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.289
 actually selling apple ipad first 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.199
 generation were enormous here then 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.570
 already in the eleventh year released ep 2 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.090
 the generation in my opinion the most successful 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:49.810
 a popular model 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.389
 to this day but what about samsung 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.150
 galaxy but you ask the first version 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.759
 this huge smartphone has been released 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.060
 after the release of the second version of samsung 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:03.820
 galaxy s galaxy s2 very successful 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.639
 smartphone but galaxy 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.850
 better because he was more powerful 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.919
 he had a huge screen and a stylus but by 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.530
 those measures actually screen into it 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:17.250
 was very huge but first today 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:20.169
 galaxy but there in my opinion already seems 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.210
 baby as it may sound strange 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.729
 and in my opinion all the same company 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.310
 samsung spied on the idea of ​​a huge 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:29.440
 smartphone or tablet and even a small 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.479
 their first not a tablet it was samsung 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.150
 galaxy tab 7.0 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.949
 if we talk about mom and tablets and everything 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.880
 the com fabric company samsung 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:41.440
 peeped this idea off her own 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.349
 Apple's competitors distant ninety 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.199
 year yes and the creation of the alps in my opinion 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:49.870
 closely related to Newton's failure 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:53.909
 With you was Dmitri Poles and channel 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.909
 Dmitry Rutaceae yet
