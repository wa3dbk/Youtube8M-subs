00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.990 
the previous parramati charge three
things<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.740> once<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.759> was<00:01:53.790> pretty

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
things at once and it was pretty

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
things at once and it was pretty
expensive<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.560> good

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
expensive and this is a really good

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.530 
expensive and this is a really good
alternative<00:01:56.430> though<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
alternative though because you get it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
alternative though because you get it
basically<00:01:57.990> exactly<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> wanted<00:01:59.040> for

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
basically exactly what you wanted for

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.080 
basically exactly what you wanted for
the<00:01:59.430> iphone<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.899> top<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.700> takes

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the iphone and on top of that it's takes

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.969 
the iphone and on top of that it's takes
up<00:02:03.270> less<00:02:03.450> space<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:04.140> does<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> lot<00:02:04.799> better

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
up less space it does have a lot better

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
up less space it does have a lot better
build<00:02:05.280> quality<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.970> haven't<00:02:06.299> seen<00:02:06.479> my

unboxing video make sure you guys go
watch<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:09.079> and<00:02:10.079> it<00:02:10.920> does<00:02:11.159> solve<00:02:11.519> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
watch that and it does solve the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030 
watch that and it does solve the
solution<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.409> problem<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.919> you're

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
solution that to the problem that you're

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.429 
solution that to the problem that you're
having<00:02:14.249> I<00:02:14.579> mean<00:02:14.609> it<00:02:14.939> is<00:02:14.969> wireless<00:02:15.569> charging<00:02:15.900> it

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
having I mean it is wireless charging it

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.349 
having I mean it is wireless charging it
works<00:02:16.650> really<00:02:16.829> well<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.309> case<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.790> will<00:02:17.849> admit

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
works really well the case I will admit

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.750 
works really well the case I will admit
is<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> little<00:02:18.930> bulky<00:02:19.169> but<00:02:20.069> i<00:02:20.099> believe<00:02:20.340> it's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
is a little bulky but i believe it's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.059 
is a little bulky but i believe it's
better<00:02:20.969> than<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.269> was<00:02:21.389> previously<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
better than it was previously and

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.379 
better than it was previously and
they're<00:02:23.279> only<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> improve<00:02:24.029> it<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
they're only going to improve it in the

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.959 
they're only going to improve it in the
future<00:02:24.749> now<00:02:25.409> i'm<00:02:25.769> really<00:02:26.189> interested<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.819> get

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
future now i'm really interested to get

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
sometime after the iphone 4 is released

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:44.809 
sometime after the iphone 4 is released
and<00:02:43.949> they<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.129> enough<00:02:44.309> time<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> play<00:02:44.790> around

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
and they have enough time to play around

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.699 
and they have enough time to play around
with<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.329> hopefully<00:02:45.629> they<00:02:45.959> will<00:02:46.169> reduce<00:02:46.349> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
with it hopefully they will reduce the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.830 
with it hopefully they will reduce the
size<00:02:46.919> and<00:02:47.189> make<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> very<00:02:47.760> easy<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.809> use

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
size and make it a very easy to use

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.259 
size and make it a very easy to use
product<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.919> as<00:02:50.189> you<00:02:50.340> guys<00:02:50.489> see<00:02:50.669> it<00:02:50.790> also<00:02:50.939> does

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
product and as you guys see it also does

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.629 
product and as you guys see it also does
have<00:02:51.449> USB<00:02:51.809> charging<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.529> can<00:02:52.709> charge<00:02:52.919> it<00:02:53.099> from

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
have USB charging you can charge it from

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.780 
have USB charging you can charge it from
USB<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.499> also<00:02:55.499> sync<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:55.980> while<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.279> cases<00:02:56.669> on

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
USB and also sync it while the cases on

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.909 
USB and also sync it while the cases on
so<00:02:56.999> that<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.299> another<00:02:57.419> nice<00:02:57.840> alternative<00:02:58.349> now

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
so that is another nice alternative now

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.769 
so that is another nice alternative now
this<00:02:59.099> isn't<00:02:59.340> wireless<00:02:59.969> syncing<00:03:00.389> so<00:03:00.599> if<00:03:00.659> you

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:00.779 
this isn't wireless syncing so if you

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.959 
this isn't wireless syncing so if you
have<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.019> sit<00:03:01.199> on<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.769> cable<00:03:02.549> plugs

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
have it sit on here that cable plugs

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.699 
have it sit on here that cable plugs
into<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.299> wall<00:03:03.599> it<00:03:03.809> doesn't<00:03:04.139> plug<00:03:04.290> into<00:03:04.499> your

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
into a wall it doesn't plug into your

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.409 
into a wall it doesn't plug into your
computer<00:03:04.849> unfortunately<00:03:05.849> which<00:03:06.029> would<00:03:06.239> be

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
computer unfortunately which would be

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.449 
computer unfortunately which would be
really<00:03:06.569> cool<00:03:06.870> but<00:03:07.559> I<00:03:07.589> know<00:03:07.829> if<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.129> do<00:03:08.279> have<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
really cool but I know if you do have a

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.099 
really cool but I know if you do have a
jailbroken<00:03:08.819> iphone<00:03:09.089> you<00:03:09.449> can<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.870> wireless

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
jailbroken iphone you can do wireless

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.709 
jailbroken iphone you can do wireless
