00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
or months to error factor - which are

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.269 
or months to error factor - which are
really<00:00:23.580> hard<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.119> find<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.720> own<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.920> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so once you've installed one mode you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.440 
so once you've installed one mode you
might<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.420> able<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.690> start<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> other<00:02:19.290> mod<00:02:20.450> ok

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
might be able to start the other mod ok

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.500 
might be able to start the other mod ok
