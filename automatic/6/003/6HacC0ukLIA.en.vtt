world so we can do here is use tools
that<00:02:27.390> are<00:02:27.570> very<00:02:27.690> familiar<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.020> our<00:02:28.140> customers

that are very familiar to our customers
to<00:02:29.250> say<00:02:29.790> select<00:02:30.390> areas<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.380> model<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:32.490> this

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to say select areas of the model in this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160 
to say select areas of the model in this
particular<00:02:32.880> case<00:02:33.210> I'm<00:02:33.420> highlighting<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.990> wing

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
particular case I'm highlighting a wing

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.980 
particular case I'm highlighting a wing
and<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.160> use<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> Photoshop<00:02:36.240> gradient

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
and I can use the Photoshop gradient

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.880 
and I can use the Photoshop gradient
tool<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.950> select<00:02:38.520> an<00:02:38.970> area<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> model<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
tool to select an area of the model and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
tool to select an area of the model and
in<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.250> case<00:02:41.520> decide<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.480> I'm<00:02:42.600> actually

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
in this case decide that I'm actually

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.080 
in this case decide that I'm actually
going<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.080> close<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.380> blend<00:02:43.920> from<00:02:44.430> an<00:02:44.580> orange<00:02:44.910> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
going to close a blend from an orange to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.220 
going to close a blend from an orange to
a<00:02:45.120> yellow<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:45.990> how<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
a yellow so we can see how the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.380 
a yellow so we can see how the
transitions<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.370> happen<00:02:47.670> from<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:47.910> color<00:02:48.240> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
transitions can happen from one color to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
transitions can happen from one color to
another<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:49.560> particular<00:02:49.830> model<00:02:50.130> is

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
another this particular model is

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.760 
another this particular model is
imported<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> single<00:02:51.450> shell<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
imported as a single shell so all the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.230 
imported as a single shell so all the
color<00:02:52.980> manipulations<00:02:53.550> here<00:02:53.730> we're<00:02:53.880> doing<00:02:54.120> are

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
color manipulations here we're doing are

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.670 
color manipulations here we're doing are
on<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> single<00:02:54.720> shell<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.350> could<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.590> been

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
on a single shell we could have been

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.170 
on a single shell we could have been
ported<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.070> model<00:02:56.310> which<00:02:56.400> had<00:02:56.550> multiple<00:02:56.910> shells

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
ported a model which had multiple shells

play<00:03:26.489> summer<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:26.970> model<00:03:27.239> what's

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
play summer on the model what's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.869 
play summer on the model what's
important<00:03:28.560> here<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.069> that<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.340> graphic<00:03:29.730> is

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
important here is that the graphic is

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.580 
important here is that the graphic is
independent<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> plane<00:03:30.930> itself<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:31.470> this

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
independent of the plane itself at this

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
independent of the plane itself at this
point<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.980> time<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.150> move<00:03:33.269> around<00:03:33.450> and

during my design process when I'm happy

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.020 
during my design process when I'm happy
these<00:04:17.160> two<00:04:17.370> things<00:04:17.579> are<00:04:17.669> in<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.850> correct

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
these two things are in the correct

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.080 
these two things are in the correct
place<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.810> very<00:04:19.049> easy<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.950> combine

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
place it's very easy to combine

this<00:04:22.690> graphic<00:04:23.050> element<00:04:23.440> onto<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.770> plane

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
this graphic element onto the plane

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.920 
this graphic element onto the plane
itself<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.180> by<00:04:25.330> merging<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.720> two

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
itself and so by merging the two

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.720 
itself and so by merging the two
components<00:04:26.440> together<00:04:26.560> I've<00:04:27.190> got<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.550> ability

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
components together I've got the ability

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.879 
components together I've got the ability
to<00:04:28.230> include<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.440> logo<00:04:29.860> on<00:04:30.550> my<00:04:30.760> plane<00:04:31.740> I'm<00:04:32.740> so

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
to include that logo on my plane I'm so

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.520 
to include that logo on my plane I'm so
that's<00:04:33.070> an<00:04:33.160> element<00:04:33.400> we<00:04:33.580> print<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:34.410> when<00:04:35.410> we're
