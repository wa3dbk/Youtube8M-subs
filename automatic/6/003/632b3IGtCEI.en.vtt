from<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.769> take<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.160> control<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
from here I can take in control the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.170 
from here I can take in control the
mannequin<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:16.379> watching<00:00:17.100> him<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.520> our<00:00:17.789> video

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
mannequin I'm watching him on our video

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.300 
mannequin I'm watching him on our video
screens<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.740> video<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
screens that we have we can video the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.439 
screens that we have we can video the
students<00:00:20.730> while<00:00:20.880> they're<00:00:21.150> doing<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
students while they're doing the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.509 
students while they're doing the
simulation<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.320> then<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.039> play<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.250> back

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
simulation and then we can play it back

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.920 
simulation and then we can play it back
on<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> flat<00:00:24.000> screen<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
on the flat screen that we have in the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.070 
on the flat screen that we have in the
room<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.410> store<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.849> store<00:00:27.269> their<00:00:27.420> videos<00:00:27.779> on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
room I store and store their videos on

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.169 
room I store and store their videos on
their<00:00:28.199> hard<00:00:28.410> drive<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.010> convert<00:00:29.429> them<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> DVD

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
their hard drive I convert them to DVD

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.959 
their hard drive I convert them to DVD
for<00:00:30.480> future<00:00:30.810> reference<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.759> see

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
for future reference that way we can see

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.840 
for future reference that way we can see
what<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.780> started<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.380> simulation<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
what they started out with simulation in

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
what they started out with simulation in
their<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.210> year<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.930> how<00:00:37.110> they

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
their first year and then how they

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.000 
their first year and then how they
progressed<00:00:37.950> throughout<00:00:38.280> their<00:00:38.489> second<00:00:38.820> year

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
progressed throughout their second year

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.709 
progressed throughout their second year
but<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.000> control<00:00:42.329> everything

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
but this is where we control everything

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
but this is where we control everything
and<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.320> through<00:00:43.620> one-way<00:00:44.010> glass<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and it's through one-way glass so that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.229 
and it's through one-way glass so that
they<00:00:44.850> can't<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.360> me<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
they can't see me and I can be the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.950 
they can't see me and I can be the
doctor<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.050> patient<00:00:50.030> sometimes<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.420> pop<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.840> as

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
doctor the patient sometimes I pop in as

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.490
