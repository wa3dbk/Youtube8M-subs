00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 You will not see days friends here 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:16.620
 I bring the amazing droid htc now 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.070
 verizon so if you do not let them pass 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.250
 on the home screen because it asks 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.440
 to activate it in the US and you do not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.530
 they are in the USA if they want to pass this 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.960
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.590
 in a very easy and simple way here 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.440
 since they are below 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 - the face as to the main page 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 we are going to always appear 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.650
 page where is the English language 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.930
 Spanish they go to the next one is going to 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.829
 say that they want it and that if they want it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.570
 activate what can they do 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.100
 I tried it once and I was not left 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.640
 so I want to show you what they are going to 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.899
 do try again cancel the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:04.040
 call try again cancel in the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.610
 call 2 try again cancel the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.979
 call 3 try again and you already 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.060
 tired and he let me in, that's what 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.060
 they have to do it that easy 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.500
 and without keyboard on the screen omit not 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.350
 I'm interested next connect to the network 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.180
 although it's not like that I want to add 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.659
 a network and I'm going to put here now 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.360
 level and that's all that is all that 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.869
 have to do if I was a little 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 fast, just come back, right now. 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.130
 I'm going to get here to me 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.899
 to my network 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.899
 so that once it is ready 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.880
 and that's all we're going right now I'm 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.880
 wanting to show you why 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 so you can see that this is ready 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.899
 it is simpler still 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.899
 that the others 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.110
 cf and connect because I'm already 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.069
 connecting to the internet to see that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 yes it could 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.689
 and I'm already connected to the internet wifi 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.579
 my house very well we continue to 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.150
 continuation location service 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.799
 service let's put that if no more 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.139
 because I want so you do not have 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.060
 why do it and you are going to put 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:33.370
 the google account that you want 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.409
 I'm going to put mine one of the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.030
 the system update install 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.580
 Later that takes me very long time 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.110
 I do log in then as 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.450
 you have already noticed guys is 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.590
 very simple everything I did in real time 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.490
 to see that the droid htc in create 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 in verizon crow 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.660
 to see if you see here 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.940
 if the screen could be activated 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.110
 activation without any problem in 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.450
 matter of a few seconds 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.950
 I'm about to upload more video sculpts me 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.980
 They could not have given enough 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.900
 already a new team came to me 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.890
 box for Motorola Droid phones 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.930
 global 2 that is what I have here 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.340
 when they put a buy a code of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.819
 unlocking and tells you that it was not possible 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.200
 unlock it now I can if they are 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.470
 they offer more notice the only drawback 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.940
 is that it has to be physically not 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.030
 can do over the internet have one that 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.450
 with connecting it to the computer with a 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.610
 program that comes in the box 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.140
 unlocked now and it's the only way 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.730
 where you can but take some 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.140
 how many minutes do nothing more then 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.290
