00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
key to getting a good wrap is probably

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
key to getting a good wrap is probably

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it impossible is I would no comply it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.500 
it impossible is I would no comply it
just<00:00:55.440> practice<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.730> would<00:00:57.090> scoop

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just practice it like that I would scoop

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
just practice it like that I would scoop
it<00:00:57.660> bring<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> wrap<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it bring up and wrap it like that this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
it bring up and wrap it like that this
whole<00:01:00.359> motion<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.870> would<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.109> practice<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
whole motion I would just practice that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.280 
whole motion I would just practice that
like<00:01:01.980> practice<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.510> week<00:01:03.600> almost

and I finally learned how to get that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
and I finally learned how to get that

I<00:01:17.549> learned<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.060> impossible<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.930> no

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
I learned how to impossible is just no

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.230 
I learned how to impossible is just no
compliance<00:01:19.470> bringing<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.070> no<00:01:20.670> comply<00:01:20.970> bring

on it and did it and I felt successful
pretty<00:01:26.430> much<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.860> most<00:01:29.040> common<00:01:29.340> problem<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pretty much the most common problem is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.420 
pretty much the most common problem is
not<00:01:29.970> wrapping<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.869> lot<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> people<00:01:32.130> don't

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
that good scoop and wrap up and uh he
probably<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> best<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.290> sure

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
probably is the best one for sure

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.039 
probably is the best one for sure
it<00:01:53.610> weighs<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.149> off<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> kicker<00:01:54.659> because

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it weighs you off the kicker because

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.990 
it weighs you off the kicker because
then<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:56.310> foots<00:01:56.640> already

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
then you get like your foots already

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
then you get like your foots already
going<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> motion<00:01:57.710> popping<00:01:58.710> off<00:01:58.860> with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
going in that motion popping off with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.450 
going in that motion popping off with
your<00:01:59.219> back<00:01:59.360> tail<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> scoops<00:02:02.280> your

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
your back tail and then it scoops your

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.590 
your back tail and then it scoops your
front<00:02:02.700> foot<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> wrap<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
front foot up and then you wrap it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.170 
front foot up and then you wrap it
around<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.079> lot<00:02:04.200> easier<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.770> would<00:02:05.759> consider

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
around a lot easier I would consider

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.029 
around a lot easier I would consider
learning<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.899> my<00:02:06.930> flat<00:02:07.290> ground<00:02:07.590> first<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
learning on my flat ground first and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
learning on my flat ground first and
then<00:02:08.190> taking<00:02:08.489> them<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.539> might

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
then taking them to that but they might

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.479 
then taking them to that but they might
even<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.080> easier<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.129> because

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
even be easier for you on that because

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.760 
even be easier for you on that because
your<00:02:11.849> front<00:02:12.150> foot<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.390> already<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:13.080> shooting

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
your front foot is already like shooting

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.530 
your front foot is already like shooting
and<00:02:14.070> your<00:02:14.160> back<00:02:14.310> foots<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.150> already

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and your back foots going up already

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.450 
and your back foots going up already
from<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> pop<00:02:16.110> there's<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> thing<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.310> here

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
from the pop there's the thing in here

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.740 
from the pop there's the thing in here
that<00:02:17.610> says<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.910> got<00:02:18.060> arrested<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.510> stealing

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
that says you got arrested for stealing

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.820 
that says you got arrested for stealing
a<00:02:19.050> golf<00:02:19.230> cart<00:02:20.990> but<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> technique<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.710> this

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
a golf cart but the technique for this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.920 
a golf cart but the technique for this
trick<00:02:23.100> basically<00:02:23.490> would<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.000> no<00:02:24.180> slide<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
trick basically would be to no slide and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.160 
trick basically would be to no slide and
as<00:02:25.560> you're<00:02:25.860> sliding
