00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.019
 since the goal 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 very good friends that as they are 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.050
 I hope very well this time 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:52.840
 I come to surround a Samsung Galaxy S2 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.380
 head and 9.100 model 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:02.860
 to reuters this terminal we're going to 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:05.770
 surround reconcile that 2 version 6.0 for 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 this will require us on the one hand the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.110
 file that will give us root access 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.979
 and on the other hand the program today that already 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.280
 I'll leave the download link of the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.130
 file and of the program in the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.759
 description of the video once 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.710
 we have the program and the file what 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.710
 we would do it would be execute or well as 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 administrator 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.450
 we execute it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.230
 and here very important never mark the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:57.100
 distribution box we leave holding as 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.100
 this and we would simply go to pda 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.360
 in pda we would go to where we have the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.509
 archive 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.560
 RUT in this case I have a 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.880
 desk 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.440
 we would have it and here we would have what 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.459
 it would be the ready and prepared program 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.810
 to root this terminal now 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.110
 we would go to the terminal 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.940
 once here in the terminal 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.280
 we went into download mode that would be 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.640
 pressing the volume button down home 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:47.209
 more power we would enter this menu 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.100
 and we would give the volume button up 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.840
 once we have 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:59.450
 the terminal so now what we would do 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.730
 would be to connect our terminal to the pc 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:07.350
 and here we see that the odin 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.920
 recognized this terminal and simply 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.950
 we would have to give it to be 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.989
 the process is very fast as you can see 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.989
 the terminal restarts and we could 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.989
 disconnect it 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.630
 and there we have it for the triangle 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.260
 yellow do not worry I'll tell you how 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.260
 take it off 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.400
 and as we can see it is 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.400
 restarting the terminal perfectly 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.200
 there you are optimizing the applications and 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.200
 they are opening them 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.230
 and here we would have the terminal 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.409
 rooted 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.299
 Once we have already rooted and 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.299
 we could leave here 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.580
 and now we would go check the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.740
 root access in the terminal once there 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:35.460
 in the rooteado terminal we would go to 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:40.230
 application drawer and here we have it 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:45.150
 we have the lower mode the application 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:48.870
 cw vm like that finish is already surrounded 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.110
 let's check it we enter the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.529
 application we give you permission to 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.459
 Super user 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:02.480
 and we would go to global mod 

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:06.010
 we go to the world mod 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.010
 we give ruth 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.670
 and here we would have the terminal surrounded 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.880
 with an advanced recovery with which 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:33.360
 we can do many things flashing 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.370
 new and clean the phone 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.669
 dual boot 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.389
 and many little things that can be done with 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:46.169
 an advanced recovery the record and it's 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:50.040
 tactile as we can see here we have the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:53.320
 buttons to go down and up to go 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:57.060
 back to select 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:01.000
 let's select for example from this 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:05.230
 we select we go back 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.840
 and good friends this has been all I hope 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:12.040
 that this little video tutorial has 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:16.810
 liked subscribe little hand up little hand 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:20.020
 down from jaen comment and here we are 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:25.140
