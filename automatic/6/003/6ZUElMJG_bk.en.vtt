00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
goals and I I just think I can help him

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.799 
goals and I I just think I can help him
in<00:00:36.540> any<00:00:36.870> position<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.649> he's<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> best<00:00:38.809> he

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
in any position really he's the best he

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
in any position really he's the best he
runs<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.260> mean<00:00:40.829> he<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> speed

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
runs very mean he that's a lot of speed

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
runs very mean he that's a lot of speed
so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.989> they're<00:00:43.469> looking

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
so I would think they they're looking

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.160 
so I would think they they're looking
for<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.480> that's<00:00:45.480> definitely<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.960> first

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
for that so that's definitely the first

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
for that so that's definitely the first
thing<00:00:46.379> I'll<00:00:46.530> say<00:00:46.559> speed<00:00:48.559> no<00:00:49.559> no<00:00:49.920> uh<00:00:50.160> yeah<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
thing I'll say speed no no uh yeah I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.520 
thing I'll say speed no no uh yeah I
agree<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.600> guess<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:51.989> knows<00:00:52.289> me

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
agree with that I guess he knows me

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
agree with that I guess he knows me
quite<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.190> uh<00:00:53.250> he<00:00:53.789> definitely<00:00:54.059> go

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
quite a bit but uh he definitely go

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.549 
quite a bit but uh he definitely go
through<00:00:54.480> off<00:00:54.600> his<00:00:54.780> experience<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.440> knowledge

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
through off his experience and knowledge

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:27.459 
through off his experience and knowledge
of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> game<00:00:56.010> definitely
