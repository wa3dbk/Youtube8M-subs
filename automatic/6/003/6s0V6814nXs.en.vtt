00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.050 
I was like I don't know if I like it
because<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.920> wasn't<00:01:47.189> used<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because I wasn't used to the way that it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
because I wasn't used to the way that it
looked<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.630> she<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:48.990> did<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> shape

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
looked but she actually did the shape

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.490 
looked but she actually did the shape
much<00:01:50.280> better<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.880> suit<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.240> face<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
much better to suit my face and it was a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.090 
much better to suit my face and it was a
lot<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.680> natural<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.840> um<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.740> really

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
lot more natural and um I really really

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
lot more natural and um I really really
am<00:01:56.399> glad<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.000> did<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
am glad that I did it you know at the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.870 
am glad that I did it you know at the
time<00:01:57.810> she<00:01:58.020> offered<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.100> my<00:01:59.250> eyeliner<00:01:59.399> for

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
time she offered to do my eyeliner for

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.719 
time she offered to do my eyeliner for
free<00:02:00.090> too<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.979> don't<00:02:02.340> wear<00:02:02.430> eyeliner

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
free too but I I don't wear eyeliner

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
free too but I I don't wear eyeliner
every<00:02:03.090> day<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.229> just

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
every day and I was like that is just

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.679 
every day and I was like that is just
way<00:02:04.680> too<00:02:04.740> close<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.399> my<00:02:05.520> eyes<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.030> basically

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
way too close to my eyes so basically

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.619 
way too close to my eyes so basically
what<00:02:06.899> happens<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.409> she<00:02:07.740> puts<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> little<00:02:08.220> bit<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
what happens is she puts a little bit of

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.290 
what happens is she puts a little bit of
cream<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.800> stuff<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.700> skin

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
cream like this stuff on your skin

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.210 
cream like this stuff on your skin
it's<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> topical<00:02:14.150> anesthetic<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.920> my

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it's like a topical anesthetic and my

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.770 
it's like a topical anesthetic and my
skin<00:02:17.490> actually<00:02:17.730> wouldn't<00:02:18.060> take<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.270> ink<00:02:18.540> so

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
skin actually wouldn't take the ink so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.240 
skin actually wouldn't take the ink so
we<00:02:18.930> had<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> wipe<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.470> off<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.830> then<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.160> it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
we had to wipe it off and then do it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.010 
we had to wipe it off and then do it
without<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.700> anesthetic<00:02:21.300> because<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.750> don't

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
without the anesthetic because I don't

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.660 
without the anesthetic because I don't
know<00:02:22.170> why<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.380> guess<00:02:22.710> your<00:02:22.860> skin<00:02:23.100> might<00:02:23.310> take<00:02:23.520> it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
know why I guess your skin might take it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.040 
know why I guess your skin might take it
better<00:02:23.790> without<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.330> anesthetic<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.900> don't

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
better without the anesthetic I don't

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.160 
better without the anesthetic I don't
know<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.410> then<00:02:26.220> after<00:02:26.730> you're<00:02:26.850> dead<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.510> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
know and then after you're dead like you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.870 
know and then after you're dead like you
look<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.470> bear<00:02:28.710> because<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.490> super
