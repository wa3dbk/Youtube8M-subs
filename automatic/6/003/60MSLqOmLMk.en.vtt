00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.799
 therefore the devils of today like 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.670
 take advantage of a TV amp like 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.730
 normal amplifiers say 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:19.289
 obviously this goes up to a few years 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 does this amp here from TV and not 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.769
 I can really tell from what TV came exactly 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 I do not know this not taken apart so many years 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.950
 does and I don't remember as fair as you can 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.840
 note there is a capacitor that is different 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.710
 from another because then when providi 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.719
 make it work 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.570
 and I seem to have seen the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.300
 capacitor that was gone but was not 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 it was not a question of the capacitor 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.989
 however this part did not work 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 because I connected that I was convinced that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 then the two masses were separated 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 we connect both from masses of everything but 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:06.049
 alloy also goes to ground and we say the pin 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.049
 of mute in TV 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 in fact for what was wrong lacen 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.860
 I have to go for a little bit then after yes 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.420
 it was off because it was not connected 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 virtually flush with the upstream most and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.720
 linda mostly works and instead comes off 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 never mute we say so complicated 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:36.060
 reformed by a focus that the bie 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.070
 dix 34 a and a mix 33 a for each channel 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.180
 let's say so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 11 left right I would say that power 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.360
 both be miserable anyway to make little ones 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 ciapini can also use us 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.430
 feeding to normal is not dual 20 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.430
 sometimes in this case I tried to do 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 also work 12 but croaks one 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.380
 cash practically there is not there is not given 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.969
 condenser time to recharge 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.950
 instead of increasing voltage you can hear 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.349
 immediately the difference then I put a 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.730
 potentiometer then input for 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.349
 adapt an impedance even if by itself 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.739
 they are really mass problems 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.660
 etc. 600 buzzing father however vi 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.690
 I show that by combining the amplify 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.410
 turin tv with good houses with the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:35.060
 good music can also skip music 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:37.160
 well we see a little yes indeed yes 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.720
 can hear the hum of the mute background 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 a home music 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.870
 if obviously we need to perfect it 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.580
 as for an acceptable test 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.390
 he kept will also put hamas 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.060
 the case of potential if it was not heard 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.380
 the buzzing and however one hears in the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.380
 himself is still a little disturbed 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.060
 we enhance there is also a slip that a 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.540
 po oxidized because one continues to 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.720
 go one night 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.370
 Oh well 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.629
 egg 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.629
 I will look for a stock fund 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.580
 there is also the mood 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.740
 I'm glad I did well to keep it 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.910
 still there of years but in the end it is 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.210
 it was worth it because I managed to 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.210
 make it work 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.849
 but next time
