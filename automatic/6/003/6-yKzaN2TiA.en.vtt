I'm<00:00:00.669> going<00:00:00.820> to<00:00:00.880> show<00:00:01.030> you<00:00:01.089> how<00:00:01.240> to<00:00:01.300> use<00:00:01.739> some<00:00:02.739> of

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:02.830 
I'm going to show you how to use some of

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.010 
I'm going to show you how to use some of
the<00:00:02.889> functions<00:00:03.400> and<00:00:03.759> sort<00:00:04.450> of<00:00:04.540> problems<00:00:04.930> you

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.020 
the functions and sort of problems you

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.090 
the functions and sort of problems you
might<00:00:05.140> occur<00:00:05.530> on<00:00:05.920> a<00:00:05.980> fairly<00:00:06.850> high<00:00:07.240> key<00:00:07.540> boiler

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
might occur on a fairly high key boiler

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.200 
might occur on a fairly high key boiler
I'm<00:00:09.100> going<00:00:09.280> to<00:00:09.340> go<00:00:09.400> through<00:00:09.610> each<00:00:09.700> button<00:00:10.090> at<00:00:10.180> a

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
I'm going to go through each button at a

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.250 
I'm going to go through each button at a
time<00:00:10.510> and<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.160> starting<00:00:13.030> with<00:00:13.120> the<00:00:13.240> top<00:00:13.480> we've

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
time and so starting with the top we've

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.149 
time and so starting with the top we've
got<00:00:14.290> the<00:00:14.410> temperature<00:00:15.040> controls<00:00:16.800> they<00:00:17.800> start

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:18.159 
got the temperature controls they start

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.109 
got the temperature controls they start
pressing<00:00:18.400> it<00:00:18.609> down<00:00:20.429> or<00:00:21.429> we<00:00:21.460> might<00:00:21.730> want<00:00:22.060> to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
pressing it down or we might want to

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.739 
pressing it down or we might want to
press<00:00:22.329> them<00:00:22.649> up<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:25.269> the<00:00:25.449> temperature

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
press them up that's the temperature

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:32.190 
press them up that's the temperature
control<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.449> hot<00:00:28.569> water<00:00:29.939> then<00:00:30.939> we've<00:00:31.720> got<00:00:31.960> the

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
control the hot water then we've got the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.300 
control the hot water then we've got the
plus<00:00:33.100> or<00:00:33.250> minus<00:00:33.580> on<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.850> bottom<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.950> is<00:00:36.100> the

there's an actual picture of a Sun which

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.709 
there's an actual picture of a Sun which
means<00:01:21.819> it's<00:01:21.969> actually<00:01:22.240> on<00:01:22.329> for<00:01:22.509> summer

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
means it's actually on for summer

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.080 
means it's actually on for summer
setting<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:24.130> means<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> ball<00:01:24.670> will<00:01:24.909> not

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
setting that means the ball will not

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.179 
setting that means the ball will not
come<00:01:25.299> on<00:01:25.450> for<00:01:25.659> heating<00:01:26.079> does<00:01:26.799> one<00:01:26.950> if<00:01:27.039> you've

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
come on for heating does one if you've

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.980 
come on for heating does one if you've
got<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.429> clock<00:01:27.639> on<00:01:27.819> time<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.630> clock<00:01:28.840> on

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
got the clock on time the clock on

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.230 
got the clock on time the clock on
constant<00:01:29.649> or<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.159> room<00:01:30.549> starts<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.090> to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
constant or the room starts it to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.319 
constant or the room starts it to
maximum<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.159> if<00:01:33.340> you've<00:01:33.520> ever<00:01:33.609> got<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.090> and

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
maximum so if you've ever got that and

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.550 
maximum so if you've ever got that and
you've<00:01:34.420> got<00:01:34.600> no<00:01:34.749> Center<00:01:35.049> here<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.350> hall

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
you've got no Center here in the hall

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.749 
you've got no Center here in the hall
first<00:01:36.549> check<00:01:36.819> that<00:01:36.850> little<00:01:37.649> corner<00:01:38.649> there<00:01:39.069> or

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
first check that little corner there or

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.709 
first check that little corner there or
just<00:01:39.789> to<00:01:40.030> get<00:01:40.179> it<00:01:40.270> off

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
just to get it off

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.940 
just to get it off
you<00:01:41.319> press<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.679> button<00:01:42.029> came<00:01:43.029> to<00:01:43.240> one<00:01:43.450> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you press the button came to one and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.109 
you press the button came to one and
then<00:01:44.950> go<00:01:45.189> as<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.329> can<00:01:46.479> notice<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.490> disappeared

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
then go as you can notice it disappeared

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.599 
then go as you can notice it disappeared
that<00:01:49.810> means<00:01:50.079> now<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.709> can<00:01:50.979> use<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.159> central

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
that means now you can use a central

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.669 
that means now you can use a central
heating<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.149> I<00:01:52.840> do<00:01:52.899> go<00:01:53.229> through<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.469> lot<00:01:53.649> of

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
heating and I do go through a lot of

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.800 
heating and I do go through a lot of
cause<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.639> takes<00:01:54.819> about<00:01:54.939> one<00:01:55.090> second

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
cause of that it takes about one second

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.660 
cause of that it takes about one second
obviously<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.310> do<00:01:57.459> it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
obviously just to do it

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.569 
obviously just to do it
and<00:01:57.969> obviously<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.740> very<00:01:59.920> hard<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.249> charge

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
and obviously it's very hard to charge

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.870 
and obviously it's very hard to charge
for<00:02:00.849> it<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.119> for<00:02:01.299> one<00:02:01.479> second<00:02:01.959> to<00:02:02.079> work<00:02:02.880> then

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
for it is for one second to work then

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.779 
for it is for one second to work then
we've<00:02:03.999> got<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.299> reset<00:02:05.249> if<00:02:06.249> oil<00:02:06.399> kick<00:02:06.639> is

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
we've got the reset if oil kick is

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.600 
we've got the reset if oil kick is
pressed<00:02:07.060> in<00:02:07.270> for<00:02:07.509> too<00:02:07.689> long<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:09.070> screen<00:02:09.400> will

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
pressed in for too long the screen will

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.360 
pressed in for too long the screen will
actually<00:02:09.880> change<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:11.740> do<00:02:11.800> come<00:02:12.100> across<00:02:12.340> a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
actually change and I do come across a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
full code it could be a one f15 f40 you

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.920 
full code it could be a one f15 f40 you
can<00:02:58.990> try<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.260> press<00:02:59.380> reset<00:02:59.800> first<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.930> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
get it fixed and get an engineer out

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.530 
get it fixed and get an engineer out
then<00:03:09.100> we've<00:03:09.220> got<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.460> eco<00:03:09.730> comfort<00:03:10.210> button

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
then we've got the eco comfort button

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.990 
then we've got the eco comfort button
and<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.010> also<00:03:12.310> are<00:03:12.550> not<00:03:12.730> enough

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
and this is and also are not enough

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.550 
and this is and also are not enough
butter<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.920> undo<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> eco<00:03:15.640> comfort<00:03:16.120> first

butter now undo the eco comfort first
eco<00:03:17.560> comfort<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.190> basically<00:03:18.870> preheat<00:03:19.870> hot

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
eco comfort is basically preheat hot

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.770 
eco comfort is basically preheat hot
water<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:21.370> will<00:03:21.550> keep<00:03:21.730> preheating<00:03:22.540> your<00:03:22.660> hot

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
water it will keep preheating your hot

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.370 
water it will keep preheating your hot
water<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.950> probably<00:03:24.220> about<00:03:24.340> 55<00:03:24.910> degrees

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
water to probably about 55 degrees

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.900 
water to probably about 55 degrees
throughout<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.590> day<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.430> your<00:03:27.550> hot<00:03:27.700> water

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
throughout the day so your hot water

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.660 
throughout the day so your hot water
comes<00:03:28.420> through<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.840> lot<00:03:29.020> more<00:03:29.050> quicker<00:03:29.500> if<00:03:30.430> it's

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
comes through a lot more quicker if it's

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.720 
comes through a lot more quicker if it's
set<00:03:30.850> on<00:03:30.880> eco<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:31.990> now<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:33.130> water<00:03:33.370> is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
set on eco like it is now the water is

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.780 
set on eco like it is now the water is

middle<00:03:49.240> of<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.360> night<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.780> can<00:03:49.930> keep<00:03:50.140> heating

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
middle of the night you can keep heating

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.260 
middle of the night you can keep heating
your<00:03:50.530> boiler<00:03:50.740> going<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.370> enough<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:52.000> far

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
your boiler going on enough it's far

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.120 
your boiler going on enough it's far
enough<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:53.350> know<00:03:53.530> for<00:03:53.710> a<00:03:53.770> fact<00:03:53.950> you've

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
enough and you know for a fact you've

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.230 
enough and you know for a fact you've
got<00:03:54.280> no<00:03:54.460> taps<00:03:54.760> open<00:03:55.000> no<00:03:55.900> heating<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:57.240> believe

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
got no taps open no heating on I believe

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.360 
got no taps open no heating on I believe
just<00:03:58.510> data<00:03:58.720> if<00:03:59.020> it's<00:03:59.170> blank<00:03:59.440> then<00:04:00.190> that's

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
just data if it's blank then that's

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.700 
just data if it's blank then that's
probably<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.730> reason<00:04:00.910> why<00:04:01.320> we<00:04:02.320> need<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.530> do<00:04:02.620> is

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
probably the reason why we need to do is

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.260 
probably the reason why we need to do is
press<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:02.980> button<00:04:04.530> ytc<00:04:05.530> eco<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.490> that<00:04:07.060> means

press this button ytc eco and that means

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.180 
press this button ytc eco and that means
it<00:04:07.480> will<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:07.690> heat<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.080> hot<00:04:08.170> water<00:04:08.410> up<00:04:08.680> only

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
it will just heat the hot water up only

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.720 
it will just heat the hot water up only
when<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:09.610> open<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.000> tap<00:04:10.240> and<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.430> another

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
when you open a tap and this is another

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.130 
when you open a tap and this is another
fault<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.180> will<00:04:13.420> go<00:04:13.630> out<00:04:13.660> too<00:04:13.900> which<00:04:14.050> will

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
fault that will go out too which will

out of water you've just read pressurize

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.600 
out of water you've just read pressurize
the<00:05:40.669> system<00:05:40.700> back<00:05:41.660> up<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:41.960> where<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.139> should<00:05:42.440> be

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
the system back up to where it should be

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.790 
the system back up to where it should be
or<00:05:43.610> you've<00:05:44.060> gotta<00:05:44.300> add<00:05:44.570> an<00:05:44.840> A<00:05:44.960> one<00:05:45.200> full<00:05:45.470> code

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800

and basically it's F H as a little joke

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.620 
and basically it's F H as a little joke
we<00:05:51.349> call<00:05:51.530> it<00:05:51.650> for<00:05:51.860> only<00:05:52.070> heating<00:05:52.820> you<00:05:53.419> just

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
we call it for only heating you just

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.390 
we call it for only heating you just
basically<00:05:53.780> taking<00:05:54.200> all<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.500> components<00:05:54.830> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
basically taking all the components the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.330 
basically taking all the components the
fan<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:56.030> pump<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.510> sensors<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.860> making<00:05:58.190> sure

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
fan the pump the sensors to making sure

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.550 
fan the pump the sensors to making sure
they<00:05:58.490> all<00:05:58.639> work<00:05:58.849> it<00:05:59.510> could<00:05:59.720> take<00:05:59.900> up<00:06:00.050> to<00:06:00.080> at

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
they all work it could take up to at

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.650 
they all work it could take up to at
least<00:06:01.389> 90<00:06:02.389> seconds<00:06:02.960> or<00:06:03.139> two<00:06:03.530> minutes<00:06:03.979> and

least 90 seconds or two minutes and

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.610 
least 90 seconds or two minutes and
that's<00:06:05.660> just<00:06:05.870> pretty<00:06:06.080> normal

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
that's just pretty normal
