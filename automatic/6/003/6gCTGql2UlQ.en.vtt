00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.980 

so<00:00:03.000> John<00:00:03.270> what<00:00:03.989> is<00:00:04.259> area<00:00:05.150> every<00:00:06.150> basically<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
so John what is area every basically a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.660 
so John what is area every basically a
mechanical<00:00:07.620> form<00:00:07.860> of<00:00:07.980> putting<00:00:08.250> holes<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
mechanical form of putting holes in the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.940 
mechanical form of putting holes in the
ground<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.720> machine<00:00:10.050> puts<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.560> hole<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:10.890> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
ground the machine puts a hole in the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.150 
ground the machine puts a hole in the
ground<00:00:11.130> frees<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> core<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> top<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
ground frees a core up to the top and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.980 
ground frees a core up to the top and
that's<00:00:14.160> pretty<00:00:14.370> much<00:00:14.550> it<00:00:14.760> so<00:00:14.990> basically

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that's pretty much it so basically

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.650 
that's pretty much it so basically
you're<00:00:16.800> putting<00:00:17.039> holes<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.060> ground<00:00:18.240> is

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you're putting holes in the ground is

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.150 
you're putting holes in the ground is
what<00:00:18.869> you're<00:00:19.020> saying<00:00:19.170> that's<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.770> that's<00:00:19.980> all

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
what you're saying that's it that's all

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.990 
what you're saying that's it that's all
you're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.520> okay<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:22.369> when<00:00:23.369> would<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
you're going okay now when would be the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.060 
you're going okay now when would be the
best<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.529> best<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> do

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
best time to do this the best time to do

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550 
best time to do this the best time to do
it<00:00:26.190> is<00:00:26.279> bringing<00:00:26.640> fall<00:00:26.880> arrays<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.050> very

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it is bringing fall arrays a very

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.290 
it is bringing fall arrays a very
important<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.100> do<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> since<00:00:30.090> Mother

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
important thing to do and since Mother

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.810 
important thing to do and since Mother
Nature<00:00:30.630> gives<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.930> conditions<00:00:31.470> suitable<00:00:32.399> for

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
Nature gives the conditions suitable for

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.250 
Nature gives the conditions suitable for
aerating<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> spring<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.750> fall<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
aerating the spring in the fall with the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
aerating the spring in the fall with the
moisture<00:00:34.620> content<00:00:34.970> that's<00:00:35.970> what<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
moisture content that's what you want to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
moisture content that's what you want to
do<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.710> pull<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> better<00:00:38.160> core<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
do it you can pull a better core and the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
do it you can pull a better core and the
deeper<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> core<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> better<00:00:39.890> during<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
deeper the core the better during the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.340 
deeper the core the better during the
summer<00:00:41.219> time<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> core<00:00:41.880> aeration<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.930> harder

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
summer time the core aeration is harder

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.900 
summer time the core aeration is harder
to<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.710> simply<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> ground<00:00:44.700> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
to do this simply because the ground is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
to do this simply because the ground is
like<00:00:44.940> concrete<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:45.930> dry<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.290> very

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
like concrete it's very dry and very

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
like concrete it's very dry and very
hard<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.100> can't<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.700> court<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
hard we can't get it in court so in the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
hard we can't get it in court so in the
spring<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> fall<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.250> more

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
spring in the fall you have more

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.139 
spring in the fall you have more
moisture<00:00:51.559> which<00:00:52.559> allows<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.789> deeper

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
moisture which allows you to get deeper

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840 
moisture which allows you to get deeper
into<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> ground<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> pull<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.860> dirt<00:00:56.610> out

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
into the ground and pull more dirt out

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
into the ground and pull more dirt out
of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> ground<00:00:57.360> absolutely<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.860> plugs

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
of the ground absolutely and your plugs

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
of the ground absolutely and your plugs
are<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.910> again<00:01:00.090> deeper

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
are going to be you know again deeper

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
are going to be you know again deeper
and<00:01:00.809> wider<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.860> way<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> comes<00:01:02.309> up

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and wider so that way when it comes up

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.479 
and wider so that way when it comes up
to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.969> surface<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.619> holes<00:01:04.829> left<00:01:05.039> behind

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to the surface the the holes left behind

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
to the surface the the holes left behind
you<00:01:05.609> can<00:01:05.729> allow<00:01:05.909> better<00:01:06.270> action<00:01:06.539> levels<00:01:07.259> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you can allow better action levels and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.769 
you can allow better action levels and
better<00:01:07.499> moisture<00:01:08.039> down<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.459> root<00:01:08.609> system

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:08.779 
better moisture down to the root system

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:12.169 
better moisture down to the root system
okay<00:01:09.779> so<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.229> leads<00:01:10.469> us<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.649> why<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.609> would

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
okay so that leads us to why you would

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.830 
okay so that leads us to why you would
Eric<00:01:12.889> well<00:01:13.889> the<00:01:14.009> best<00:01:14.249> reason<00:01:15.149> to<00:01:15.270> explain<00:01:15.600> why

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
Eric well the best reason to explain why

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
Eric well the best reason to explain why
is<00:01:15.899> as<00:01:16.709> we've<00:01:16.889> said<00:01:17.099> you<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.520> oxygen<00:01:17.999> level

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
is as we've said you the oxygen level

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.440 
is as we've said you the oxygen level
goes<00:01:18.450> down<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.929> root<00:01:19.079> system<00:01:20.450> that's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
goes down to the root system that's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
goes down to the root system that's
important<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.899> do<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.109> because<00:01:22.200> everything

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
important to do it because everything

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.690 
important to do it because everything
needs<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.219> breathe

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
needs to breathe

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
needs to breathe
it<00:01:24.029> also<00:01:24.149> loosens<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.779> the<00:01:24.929> soil<00:01:25.139> so<00:01:25.469> that<00:01:25.499> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it also loosens up the soil so that the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.349 
it also loosens up the soil so that the
new<00:01:25.859> oxygen<00:01:26.219> getting<00:01:26.700> down<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.209> root

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
new oxygen getting down to the root

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.839 
new oxygen getting down to the root
system<00:01:27.389> can<00:01:28.259> make<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.619> root<00:01:28.829> system<00:01:29.219> expand

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
system can make the root system expand

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:33.019 
system can make the root system expand
and<00:01:30.179> it's<00:01:30.959> a<00:01:31.049> natural<00:01:31.229> form<00:01:31.679> of<00:01:31.919> the<00:01:32.700> next

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:33.029 
and it's a natural form of the next

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.659 
and it's a natural form of the next
generation<00:01:33.539> of<00:01:33.569> regrowth<00:01:34.069> it<00:01:35.069> also<00:01:35.249> allows

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:35.669 
generation of regrowth it also allows

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:38.629 
generation of regrowth it also allows
the<00:01:36.619> anything<00:01:37.619> else<00:01:37.709> you<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.069> like<00:01:38.279> the<00:01:38.399> water

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
the anything else you do like the water

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.459 
the anything else you do like the water
or<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.999> fertilizer<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.749> get<00:01:39.899> down<00:01:40.109> in<00:01:40.289> there<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
or the fertilizer to get down in there a

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.279 
or the fertilizer to get down in there a
little<00:01:40.649> faster<00:01:40.859> to<00:01:41.249> react<00:01:41.520> better<00:01:41.899> okay<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:42.959> we

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
little faster to react better okay so we

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.249 
little faster to react better okay so we
know<00:01:43.499> what<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.569> when<00:01:45.569> you<00:01:45.599> should<00:01:45.959> do<00:01:46.109> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
know what it is when you should do it
