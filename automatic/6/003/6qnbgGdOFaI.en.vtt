character<00:01:17.369> along<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.970> ranged<00:01:18.539> and

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
character along with ranged and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.719 
character along with ranged and
projectile<00:01:19.229> zoning<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:20.130> seems<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.580> lot

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
projectile zoning he seems to have a lot

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.279 
projectile zoning he seems to have a lot
of<00:01:20.850> his<00:01:20.940> classic<00:01:21.330> moves<00:01:21.539> but<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> seems<00:01:22.110> like

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
of his classic moves but it seems like

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.960 
of his classic moves but it seems like
he's<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:23.130> gonna<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.670> things<00:01:23.910> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
he's really gonna have to do things a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.310 
he's really gonna have to do things a
little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.210> differently<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.899> this<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
little bit differently and this is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.139 
little bit differently and this is
mostly<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.039> there's<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.670> element<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
mostly because there's one element that

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.430 
mostly because there's one element that
I'd<00:01:27.300> really<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:27.990> highlight<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.410> the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
chest opens up and reveals a power core
of<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.750> charging<00:01:43.470> has<00:01:43.560> emphasized<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
of some kind charging has emphasized a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.679 
of some kind charging has emphasized a
lot<00:01:44.400> at<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> beginning<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.270> trail<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
lot at the beginning of this trail and I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.090 
lot at the beginning of this trail and I
think<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.080> gonna<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.409> something<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> do

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
think that's gonna have something to do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
think that's gonna have something to do
with<00:01:47.130> how<00:01:47.850> he<00:01:48.090> manages<00:01:48.509> meter<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:49.259> also<00:01:49.409> heard

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
with how he manages meter we also heard

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
with how he manages meter we also heard
from<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> previous<00:01:50.040> Microsoft<00:01:50.729> streams<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
from the previous Microsoft streams that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
from the previous Microsoft streams that
he<00:01:51.420> does<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.900> some<00:01:52.140> unique<00:01:52.439> ways<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.890> getting

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
he does have some unique ways of getting

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
he does have some unique ways of getting
meters<00:01:53.490> similar<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.000> spinal<00:01:54.270> getting<00:01:54.600> skulls

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
meters similar to spinal getting skulls

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840 
meters similar to spinal getting skulls
so<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.590> pretty<00:01:55.740> sure<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> related<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
so I'm pretty sure this is related and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.429 
so I'm pretty sure this is related and
it's<00:01:57.000> gonna<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> very<00:01:57.540> important<00:01:57.960> factor<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it's gonna be a very important factor of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.499 
it's gonna be a very important factor of
fulgor<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> character<00:01:59.610> later<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
fulgor as a character later on we see a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.609 
fulgor as a character later on we see a
lot<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.720> different<00:02:01.020> moves<00:02:01.200> coming<00:02:01.439> out

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
lot of different moves coming out

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.289 
lot of different moves coming out
between<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.220> cyber<00:02:02.460> dash<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> eye

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
between like the cyber dash and the eye

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.880 
between like the cyber dash and the eye
lasers<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.380> glad<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.740> back

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
lasers which I'm really glad are back

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.350 
lasers which I'm really glad are back
that's<00:02:05.159> something<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:05.790> seems<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> be

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's something that really seems to be

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.030 
that's something that really seems to be
a<00:02:06.390> staple<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.200> getting<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> hint<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:07.920> is

folkore has a move like this it can mean

him being potential and viable in really
high-level<00:02:35.370> tournaments<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.420> other<00:02:36.570> thing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
high-level tournaments the other thing

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360 
high-level tournaments the other thing
that's<00:02:37.019> crazy<00:02:37.260> about<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.769> is<00:02:37.829> that<00:02:38.160> I'm

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that's crazy about this is that I'm

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.400 
that's crazy about this is that I'm
seeing<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> lot<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:39.420> weird<00:02:39.690> special

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
seeing a lot of really weird special

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.740 
seeing a lot of really weird special
cancelling<00:02:41.040> abilities<00:02:41.579> we've<00:02:42.090> seen<00:02:42.299> spinal

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
cancelling abilities we've seen spinal

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.970 
cancelling abilities we've seen spinal
do<00:02:42.900> certain<00:02:43.200> things<00:02:43.410> where<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.769> cancel

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
do certain things where you can cancel

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.189 
do certain things where you can cancel
into<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.340> special<00:02:44.699> moves<00:02:44.910> very<00:02:45.090> fast<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.780> I

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:46.199 
into a special moves very fast and I

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.750 
into a special moves very fast and I
think<00:02:46.470> Bogor<00:02:46.859> has<00:02:47.070> something<00:02:47.400> similar

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
think Bogor has something similar

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.550 
think Bogor has something similar
if<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.180> look<00:02:48.330> at<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.569> he<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:49.170> launches

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
if you look at this he actually launches

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
if you look at this he actually launches
them<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:49.950> an<00:02:50.040> eye<00:02:50.190> laser<00:02:50.430> special<00:02:50.970> goes

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
them up with an eye laser special goes

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.970 
them up with an eye laser special goes
immediately<00:02:51.750> into<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.409> his<00:02:52.470> fireball

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
immediately into one of his fireball

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
immediately into one of his fireball
attacks<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:53.760> an<00:02:53.909> uppercut<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:54.659> what

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
attacks and then an uppercut or what

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.390 
attacks and then an uppercut or what
looks<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> shadow<00:02:55.379> uppercut<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.159> if<00:02:56.310> this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
looks like a shadow uppercut and if this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.009 
looks like a shadow uppercut and if this
is<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.580> case<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.060> means<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.450> fulgor<00:02:57.810> can

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
is the case that means that fulgor can

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.960 
is the case that means that fulgor can
actually<00:02:58.440> cancel<00:02:58.769> special<00:02:59.069> into<00:02:59.549> special

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
actually cancel special into special

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.270 
actually cancel special into special
maybe<00:03:00.150> which<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.599> freakin<00:03:01.319> nuts<00:03:01.560> um<00:03:01.830> that's

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
maybe which is freakin nuts um that's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.039 
maybe which is freakin nuts um that's
gonna<00:03:02.459> cause<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.970> some<00:03:03.090> insane<00:03:03.450> things<00:03:03.840> as

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
the opposition but but this projectile

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.619 
the opposition but but this projectile
seems<00:03:40.530> like<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:40.829> extremely<00:03:41.519> fast<00:03:41.700> has<00:03:42.090> crazy

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
seems like it's extremely fast has crazy

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.210 
seems like it's extremely fast has crazy
range<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> lot<00:03:43.799> different<00:03:44.190> than

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
range and is a lot different than

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.680 
range and is a lot different than
anything<00:03:44.489> we've<00:03:44.760> seen<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> game<00:03:45.390> thus<00:03:45.660> far

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
anything we've seen in the game thus far

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.809 
anything we've seen in the game thus far
so<00:03:46.530> we'll<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.950> see<00:03:46.980> how<00:03:47.220> good<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.519> really

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
so we'll have to see how good it really

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.729 
so we'll have to see how good it really
is<00:03:48.090> or<00:03:48.299> if<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:48.540> worth<00:03:48.750> any<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.260> resources

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
is or if it's worth any of the resources

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.890 
is or if it's worth any of the resources
that<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:50.010> might<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.459> use<00:03:50.640> for<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.060> up<00:03:51.540> and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that you might have to use for it up and

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.870 
that you might have to use for it up and
check<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.290> out<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.620> teleports<00:03:53.250> are<00:03:53.430> back

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
check it out the teleports are back

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.460 
check it out the teleports are back
we're<00:03:54.209> actually<00:03:54.359> seeing<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.930> usage<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.410> a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
we're actually seeing the usage of a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.259 
we're actually seeing the usage of a
teleport<00:03:55.950> early<00:03:56.250> on<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.519> this<00:03:56.609> trailer<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
teleport early on in this trailer and it

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.059 
teleport early on in this trailer and it
does<00:03:57.480> appear<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> shadow<00:03:58.319> move<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.859> think

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
does appear to be a shadow move I think

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.129 
does appear to be a shadow move I think
it<00:03:59.400> might<00:03:59.519> be<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.760> shadow<00:04:00.030> cyber<00:04:00.419> -<00:04:00.660> goes<00:04:00.989> to

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
it might be the shadow cyber - goes to

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.599 
it might be the shadow cyber - goes to
the<00:04:01.260> immediate<00:04:01.530> opposite<00:04:02.130> side<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.370> the

the immediate opposite side of the

the immediate opposite side of the
opponent<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.090> goes<00:04:03.599> plowing<00:04:04.109> through

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
opponent and goes plowing through

whether<00:04:04.950> or<00:04:05.130> not<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.370> thing<00:04:05.609> happens<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.060> 0

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
whether or not this thing happens on 0

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.089 
whether or not this thing happens on 0
frames<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.870> highly<00:04:07.380> doubt<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.590> because<00:04:07.980> it

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
frames I highly doubt it because it

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.680 
frames I highly doubt it because it
switches<00:04:08.370> instantly<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.209> other<00:04:09.329> side<00:04:09.569> of

switches instantly to the other side of

switches instantly to the other side of
the<00:04:09.780> screen<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.230> then<00:04:10.709> be<00:04:10.829> ridiculously

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
the screen and then be ridiculously

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.640 
the screen and then be ridiculously
powerful<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.329> was<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.780> fast<00:04:13.049> but<00:04:13.290> he<00:04:13.410> does

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
powerful if it was that fast but he does

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.770 
powerful if it was that fast but he does

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.480 
can look at from this trailer we
actually<00:04:31.169> see<00:04:31.349> full<00:04:31.620> bore<00:04:31.830> throw<00:04:32.070> three

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
actually see full bore throw three

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.400 
actually see full bore throw three
fireballs<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:33.389> means<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.690> triple<00:04:34.020> fireball

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
fireballs that means the triple fireball

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.810 
fireballs that means the triple fireball
from<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.710> original<00:04:35.039> killer<00:04:35.250> instinct<00:04:35.610> games

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
from the original killer instinct games

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.909 
from the original killer instinct games
is<00:04:36.030> indeed<00:04:36.630> back<00:04:36.870> whether<00:04:37.440> or<00:04:37.560> not<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.800> gonna

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
is indeed back whether or not it's gonna

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.950 
is indeed back whether or not it's gonna
cost<00:04:38.220> meter<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.700> doesn't<00:04:39.000> appear<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.419> be<00:04:39.630> so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
cost meter it doesn't appear to be so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.450 
cost meter it doesn't appear to be so
because<00:04:40.289> he<00:04:40.440> does<00:04:40.590> not<00:04:40.620> actually<00:04:41.160> go<00:04:41.280> into<00:04:41.430> a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
because he does not actually go into a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.730 
because he does not actually go into a
shadow<00:04:41.789> move<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.150> any<00:04:42.240> kind<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.750> what<00:04:43.349> happens

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
shadow move of any kind and what happens

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.379 
shadow move of any kind and what happens
is<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.160> first<00:04:44.430> one<00:04:44.669> gets<00:04:44.910> soaked<00:04:45.180> up<00:04:45.360> by

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
is that the first one gets soaked up by

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.810 
is that the first one gets soaked up by
orchids<00:04:45.960> fire<00:04:46.199> cat<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.740> then<00:04:47.070> he<00:04:47.220> teleports

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
orchids fire cat and then he teleports

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.719 
orchids fire cat and then he teleports
through<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.300> combos<00:04:48.810> after<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.460> means

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
through and combos after so this means

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.760 
through and combos after so this means
that<00:04:50.849> fulgor<00:04:51.330> potentially<00:04:51.900> has<00:04:52.080> some<00:04:52.349> similar

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
that fulgor potentially has some similar

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.710 
that fulgor potentially has some similar
combo<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.340> an<00:04:53.699> approaching<00:04:54.120> setups<00:04:54.660> like

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
combo and an approaching setups like

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.810 
combo and an approaching setups like
spinal<00:04:55.380> as<00:04:55.530> where<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.890> throw<00:04:56.130> at<00:04:56.219> a<00:04:56.280> skull<00:04:56.610> and

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
spinal as where you throw at a skull and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.399 
spinal as where you throw at a skull and
then<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.270> teleport<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.780> opposite<00:04:58.229> side

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
then you teleport to the opposite side

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.839 
then you teleport to the opposite side
we<00:04:58.620> also<00:04:58.800> see<00:04:59.039> that<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.250> teleport<00:04:59.669> acts

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
we also see that the teleport acts

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.290 
we also see that the teleport acts
differently<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.690> it

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
differently and it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.480 
differently and it
kourt's<00:05:01.509> you<00:05:01.599> closer<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.259> opposition<00:05:02.889> now

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
kourt's you closer to the opposition now

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.279 
kourt's you closer to the opposition now
this<00:05:03.789> is<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:04.180> sets<00:05:04.419> up<00:05:04.539> so<00:05:04.810> much<00:05:04.990> stuff<00:05:05.229> that

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
this is this sets up so much stuff that

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.020 
this is this sets up so much stuff that
it's<00:05:05.530> gonna<00:05:05.620> be<00:05:05.770> crazy<00:05:06.009> fo<00:05:06.430> course<00:05:06.669> seems<00:05:06.849> like

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.939 
it's gonna be crazy fo course seems like

combo I can possibly get as well as a

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.839 
combo I can possibly get as well as a
beginner's<00:06:08.229> tutorial<00:06:08.259> but<00:06:09.130> last<00:06:09.520> but<00:06:09.639> not

this and I'm really glad to see that

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.899 
this and I'm really glad to see that
arcade<00:06:17.139> mode<00:06:17.319> isn't<00:06:17.740> just<00:06:17.979> like<00:06:18.159> go<00:06:18.699> to<00:06:18.759> the

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
arcade mode isn't just like go to the

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.129 
arcade mode isn't just like go to the
end<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.180> get<00:06:19.270> an<00:06:19.389> ending<00:06:19.630> it<00:06:19.750> looks<00:06:19.960> like

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
end you get an ending it looks like

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.990 
end you get an ending it looks like
there's<00:06:20.289> actually<00:06:20.710> cinematics<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.520> some<00:06:21.729> kind

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
there's actually cinematics of some kind

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.730 
there's actually cinematics of some kind
associated<00:06:22.569> with<00:06:22.750> it<00:06:22.930> if<00:06:23.050> you<00:06:23.469> guys<00:06:23.590> remember

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
associated with it if you guys remember

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.559 
associated with it if you guys remember
previous<00:06:24.400> arcade<00:06:24.699> mode<00:06:24.849> versions<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.389> killer

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
previous arcade mode versions of killer

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.420 
previous arcade mode versions of killer
instinct<00:06:25.930> like<00:06:26.020> ki<00:06:26.259> 2<00:06:26.380> had<00:06:26.680> multiple<00:06:27.099> endings

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
instinct like ki 2 had multiple endings

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.010 
instinct like ki 2 had multiple endings
so<00:06:27.699> it'd<00:06:28.090> be<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.270> nice<00:06:28.509> thing<00:06:28.750> if<00:06:28.840> they<00:06:28.930> were

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
so it'd be a nice thing if they were

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.360 
so it'd be a nice thing if they were
able<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.259> include<00:06:29.529> something<00:06:29.860> like<00:06:30.009> that

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
able to include something like that

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.490 
able to include something like that
albeit<00:06:30.940> I<00:06:31.120> don't<00:06:31.389> think<00:06:31.659> it's<00:06:31.779> a<00:06:31.870> possibility

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
albeit I don't think it's a possibility

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.589 
albeit I don't think it's a possibility
because<00:06:32.590> double-helix<00:06:33.340> only<00:06:33.969> had<00:06:34.120> so<00:06:34.389> much

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
because double-helix only had so much

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.959 
because double-helix only had so much
time<00:06:34.659> to<00:06:35.110> do<00:06:35.259> so<00:06:35.500> either<00:06:36.099> way<00:06:36.400> I<00:06:36.580> think<00:06:36.879> it

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969 
time to do so either way I think it

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:38.309 
time to do so either way I think it
looks<00:06:37.150> cool<00:06:37.360> I'm<00:06:37.659> glad<00:06:37.870> to<00:06:38.080> see<00:06:38.199> the

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319
