snobby and they want to be above

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.349 
snobby and they want to be above
everyone<00:02:16.680> else<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.189> you<00:02:17.849> know<00:02:17.939> that's<00:02:18.120> kind

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
everyone else and you know that's kind

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.030 
everyone else and you know that's kind
of<00:02:18.420> how<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.810> has<00:02:19.230> been<00:02:19.260> happening<00:02:19.889> because

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
of how it has been happening because

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.309 
of how it has been happening because
usually<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.700> life<00:02:20.879> it's<00:02:21.120> easier<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.810> put<00:02:22.109> other

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
usually in life it's easier to put other

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.229 
usually in life it's easier to put other
people<00:02:22.680> down<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:23.189> make<00:02:23.340> yourself<00:02:23.790> look<00:02:23.999> better

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
people down to make yourself look better

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.390 
people down to make yourself look better
so<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.049> why<00:02:25.200> people<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.829> be<00:02:25.950> superior

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
so that's why people like to be superior

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.050 
so that's why people like to be superior
with<00:02:27.209> others<00:02:27.569> but<00:02:27.959> or<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:29.069> others<00:02:29.340> against

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
with others but or for others against

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.289 
with others but or for others against
others<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.489> reality<00:02:32.700> though

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
others that you know in reality though

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.289 
others that you know in reality though
and<00:02:33.629> really<00:02:34.049> trueness<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:35.040> think<00:02:35.909> it's<00:02:36.060> best

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
and really trueness is I think it's best

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.020 
and really trueness is I think it's best
if<00:02:36.540> you'd<00:02:36.719> be<00:02:36.900> superior<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.859> your<00:02:38.370> former<00:02:38.609> self

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
if you'd be superior to your former self

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.489 
if you'd be superior to your former self
and<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.480> try<00:02:39.659> to<00:02:39.689> be<00:02:39.870> better<00:02:40.019> than<00:02:40.290> who<00:02:40.469> you

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:40.499 
and you try to be better than who you

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.289 
and you try to be better than who you
were<00:02:40.829> before<00:02:40.980> instead<00:02:41.639> of<00:02:41.730> other<00:02:41.879> people

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
were before instead of other people

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.390 
were before instead of other people
around<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.989> because<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.469> know<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:44.189> put

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
around you because you know if you put

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
around you because you know if you put
other<00:02:44.579> people<00:02:44.939> down<00:02:44.969> you're<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:45.959> going<00:02:46.139> to<00:02:46.200> be

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
other people down you're not going to be

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.720 
other people down you're not going to be
going<00:02:46.439> up<00:02:46.709> you're<00:02:46.980> still<00:02:47.069> staying<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.639> the

same level but you're still like you're

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.599 
same level but you're still like you're
just<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.290> taking<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> hammer<00:02:49.889> and<00:02:50.159> smash<00:02:50.430> in

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
just like taking a hammer and smash in

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.189 
just like taking a hammer and smash in

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.379 
up at all and you know that's not really
what<00:02:57.870> true<00:02:58.079> sue<00:02:58.290> period<00:02:58.790> superiority<00:02:59.790> is<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
what true sue period superiority is and

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.509 
what true sue period superiority is and
no<00:03:00.629> i<00:03:00.659> think<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.739> quote<00:03:01.919> was<00:03:01.949> awesome

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
no i think that the quote was awesome

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.179 
no i think that the quote was awesome
because<00:03:02.669> it's<00:03:03.419> so<00:03:03.599> true<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.199> being<00:03:04.799> superior

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
because it's so true that being superior

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.949 
because it's so true that being superior
to<00:03:05.340> your<00:03:05.459> former<00:03:05.699> self<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.359> what<00:03:06.930> true

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
to your former self is what true

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.929 
to your former self is what true
nobility<00:03:07.439> is<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.129> it's<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.430> really<00:03:08.669> great

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
nobility is and it's just really great

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.459 
nobility is and it's just really great
and<00:03:09.269> then<00:03:09.359> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.689> really<00:03:10.019> be<00:03:10.169> a<00:03:10.199> better
