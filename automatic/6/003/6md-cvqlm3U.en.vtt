what he has done when you set this

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.930 
what he has done when you set this
scheme<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.200> motion<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.979> put<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.220> token<00:01:31.640> onto

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
scheme in motion you put a token onto

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.340

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
the battlefield that's a copy of the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.790 
the battlefield that's a copy of the
target<00:01:33.740> permanent<00:01:34.190> on<00:01:34.280> opponents<00:01:34.729> controls

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
well yeah he did this to my arc angel

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.010 
well yeah he did this to my arc angel
which<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:45.619> explained<00:01:46.070> what<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.369> does

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
which I just explained what it does

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.900 
which I just explained what it does
however<00:01:48.020> as<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:49.580> can<00:01:49.729> tell<00:01:50.710> 30<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.070> 21<00:01:52.640> it

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
however as you can tell 30 and 21 it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.140 
however as you can tell 30 and 21 it
doesn't<00:01:53.660> make<00:01:53.720> any<00:01:53.960> sense<00:01:54.140> right<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.030> that

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
doesn't make any sense right and that

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.540 
doesn't make any sense right and that
should<00:01:56.360> only<00:01:56.600> activate<00:01:57.200> once<00:01:57.530> we'll<00:01:58.160> look<00:01:58.369> up

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
should only activate once we'll look up

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.940 
should only activate once we'll look up
here<00:02:00.070> he<00:02:01.070> made<00:02:01.280> copies<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:02.240> my<00:02:03.080> angels<00:02:03.680> and

them<00:04:11.659> a<00:04:11.780> email<00:04:12.580> see<00:04:13.580> if<00:04:13.730> they<00:04:13.849> can<00:04:14.000> patch<00:04:14.269> the

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
them a email see if they can patch the

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.379 
them a email see if they can patch the
