00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.469
 let's find out for ourselves yes better 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.080
 to learn to control your weight 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:19.609
 the fact is that the anatomy of the body 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.040
 such a person that has a certain 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.120
 specificity of adipose tissue 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.250
 fat cells in the human body 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.360
 begin to form very, very early 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.610
 then when the little man 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.329
 is still in the womb of the mother after 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.190
 birth in the first year of life 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.720
 fat cells continue to multiply and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.790
 increase and this process goes then 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.700
 the age of five after which he 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.910
 stops new fat cells in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.960
 the human body does not appear in 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.360
 further depending on the nature 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.309
 human nutrition then such foods 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.899
 contained in his diet then how 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.530
 develops the diet in 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.009
 certain periods of human life in 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.840
 more or less we fill 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:21.429
 these cells are fat and now especially 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.249
 it is important to understand if in our life 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:29.299
 there is such a thing as diet and 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:32.630
 the person is willing to regularly use on 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.450
 imagine those or other diets and it turns out that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.189
 he just drives fat here and there 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.009
 kick him out of the cells then fill 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.109
 cells again 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.529
 understanding of the fact that a certain 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.419
 the volume of fat cells exists in our 

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:52.939
 the body is very page 

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:57.709
 there is a risk we have to get better 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.520
 always risk getting fat have 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.529
 most people and every time you 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.020
 will experiment on yourself 

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:08.569
 use some kind of regular 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.569
 diet limiting yourself on a diet but 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.000
 make it a small short span 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.660
 time all my life forever not sit 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 be able to be prepared for that situation 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.250
 that returning to the old style of food 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.379
 your cells will fill up with fat again 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.900
 perhaps having learned this fact you are 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.690
 thinking you didnâ€™t come this moment 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.540
 when you need to be serious with understanding 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.670
 understand how to essentially 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.440
 form your food by making it 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.120
 right comfortable not to have 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.239
 test your body every time 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.910
 so the next one is very important 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:05.120
 the moment you need to know about yourself 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.790
 to really be able to feel 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.430
 yourself comfortable with that weight which 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.139
 you should have it so important 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 concept of metabolism 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.510
 I will try to explain it to you 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.170
 the most understandable because in 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 In fact, this is a very complex area of anatomy. 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.250
 human body but on simple 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.410
 example, I think we will succeed 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.480
 imagine that you want to wash 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.829
 underwear you take tass pour water there 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.609
 pour powder there you see in 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.790
 powder these specific granules and 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.690
 little green little reds 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.709
 do this here 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:00.430
 chemical solution and so 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:04.220
 wash clothes two fundamentally important 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.130
 elements that make up well so 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:13.120
 let's say in our example the washing process in 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:18.160
 Human body is especially important 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.430
 with such a process as metabolism it 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.190
 water 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.800
 but in our example it is really 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:32.449
 water and food as a washing association 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:38.389
 powder combination of these two elements and 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:41.530
 yes as a unique natural activator 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.930
 exchange which contains which contains 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.229
 biologically active substances 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.990
 allows you to run in our body 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.510
 a huge number of important necessary and 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.770
 all the necessary chemical reactions 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.500
 which actually allows spinning 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.210
 this one 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.039
 amazing chemical process 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:10.100
 which we call such a common word 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.510
 metabolism if the metabolism 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.539
 slow man is at risk 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:21.190
 easy even from a small amount of food 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:27.199
 get better if the metabolism goes 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:30.560
 well then we are well stable for a long time 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.720
 support your weight there are people with 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.229
 very active metabolism sometimes 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.090
 they are talked about as if not in horse feed 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:43.010
 but such people are not so many 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.389
 knowing these features of ours 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.280
 the body's first is that the cells 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.310
 fatty are already formed 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.310
 they are ready for what they can 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.780
 accumulate fat and the risk of getting better there is 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:03.310
 absolutely always especially if you 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:07.520
 chose the wrong weight loss method and 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.020
 the second is how to make it so without 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.810
 use of diets 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.159
 but with the help of a correctly composed 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:21.380
 power mode we managed to do 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:24.490
 and gaben substances active and this is exactly 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.800
 will be basically mom 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.360
 there that you will lose weight and in 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.639
 keep your weight down 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.750
 long enough that is really possible 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.889
 do it calmly throughout life 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:45.870
 on the right physiological and for you 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.870
 comfortable aesthetic size
