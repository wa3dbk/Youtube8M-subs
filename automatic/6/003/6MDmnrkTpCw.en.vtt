00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 because of this I know that we are not in 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.410
 minecraft 1.8 let's see one more mode 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.660
 that adds some totems that are super 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.360
 epics of this super pimp especially 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.830
 to protect the house and we're going to take a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.540
 look for the first thing that came out here 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 next to this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 that there is no blacksmith therefore it is a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.220
 little potato I propose the seed for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.200
 there in case someone is interested and we're going 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 to go tasting the exquisite superchulo 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.660
 this from those of the totems to defend 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 the house is pretty cool let's do 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 the totems that is first we have to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.450
 do the base would be that it is with one of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
 obsidian two of lapis lazuli and one of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.820
 gold then to put it there for example this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.980
 is the base of the totems then we have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 than to make an offering to the gods that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.570
 it's the little big wave the little one is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.850
 one of the rest are four golden lips and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.590
 four obsidian and the big one is about 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.960
 remains four diamonds and four 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 Obsidian the difference between 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.450
 this is the range ie the small 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 comes very good we will see it very little and 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.759
 the big one gets a lot more and then 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.670
 we have to put the totem we want 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.040
 we have the skeleton the clipper the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.710
 of zombie and the spider we're going to put the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.689
 spider for example that is done with a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.070
 diamond four spider eyes and four 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.010
 obsidian 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.510
 let's put it there we have to do 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.450
 the top part of the totem that is 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.490
 here that is with a diamond four ships 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.480
 of gold and four obsidian and we're going to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.080
 put it 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.080
 Oh 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.330
 I would have come out like lightning 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.250
 weird little let's put spyder 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.400
 question will work with the spiders are you 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.030
 of cave the question is that when you put 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.659
 a spider 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.070
 the totem kills him depends on the rank as 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.340
 I say because we have put the offering 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.990
 little kid and beating you see up here 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.299
 does not arrive but when it arrives there, yes 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.759
 these spiders dies and you have not 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.759
 tried with these there should die 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.220
 it seems that with the cave does not work 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.990
 it's a little bit more potato, let's try 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.980
 the flu for example we are going to put 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.230
 as you see in the spider Wait if 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.450
 this night action has there as if 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.010
 outside the face of the spider a bit weird 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.530
 to see but well let's put the one in 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.060
 kripper who knows the same right they know 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.590
 same but only change the material this 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.510
 half jose spider gunpowder 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.390
 let's put it there and here we go to 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.280
 change the small offering to the big one 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.280
 that's it and we're going to put a criterion 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.620
 is very cool aunt the issue is that this one 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 it goes much farther here by 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.830
 example still kills it let's stop more 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.900
 I do not know how far exactly 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.550
 here also kills him 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.320
 well to try a lot further 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.070
 to us who can do this if 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.070
 we have close to home 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.170
 ok get here 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.700
 the range of two or three of 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.050
 these have at home and I do not have to 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.570
 no monster then it can not be 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.950
 more than seven blocks high then 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.300
 let's catch all these are digital 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.620
 this is the top high let's remove 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.569
 we're going to put it here zombie skeleton and 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.420
 here I was coming up 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.889
 and spider and we're going to put the one on top of the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.829
 everything that is here 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:30.939
 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 just left to kill 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.439
 all the bugs are pretty here 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.329
 let's clarify one thing let's remove 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.219
 the offering if an offering is supposed to 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.219
 it does not work, let's put all 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.860
 put a barbarity 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.270
 those who escape have escaped but 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.360
 good 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.360
 creepers let's put the big offering 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.250
 a lot to be careful because he has 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.710
 fallen lightning and has transformed is in 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.150
 a mouth and you have to go a little bit with 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.280
 be careful because what I want to check 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.740
 is how it works in a village by 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.830
 example by eh 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.390
 something that falls lightning when you put it there 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.160
 to go a little bit carefully and we're going to 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.040
 see why put this from these of 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.430
 Zombie alone and see how it works 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.870
 out there well any 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.800
 yes yes that killing her 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.900
 I want to see if more zombies are coming 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.780
 he's pretty cool uncle of everything 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.620
 for example for this use to protect 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.139
 villages cool a lot 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.800
 I need to see if it comes one more day 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.270
 seeing that no but good because I'm going to 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.350
 listen to the fireworks and this 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.510
 of course, killing all those who 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.210
 they approach because I have all of them there 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.360
 are not zombies 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.000
 and around here zombies do not come 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.990
 damn something I wanted to check as 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.990
 defend villages this 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.900
 because there are some but it does not seem to go 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.900
 to put it on us 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.340
 carlos crazy my babies that 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.340
 it kill them 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.360
 if you kill them like cool uncle this is a 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.169
 example just about defending a village 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.360
 but you can take it and it's also 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.150
 thank you very much but good you have in the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.629
 description is for 1.8 they do not let you 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.990
 approach if you are satisfied with how 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.990
 forever 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.190
 good 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.460
 ah
