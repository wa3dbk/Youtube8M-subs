00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
would in real life we focused on certain

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.160 
would in real life we focused on certain
elements<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.300> game<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.720> helped<00:02:52.900> us<00:02:52.989> to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
elements in the game that helped us to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.140 
elements in the game that helped us to
achieve<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:55.620> Danny<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.770> do<00:02:56.920> our<00:02:57.100> by<00:02:57.880> dressing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
achieve this Danny we do our by dressing

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.060 
achieve this Danny we do our by dressing
up<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.630> putting<00:02:58.780> makeup<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.290> real<00:02:59.470> actors<00:02:59.890> and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
up and putting makeup on real actors and

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.710 
up and putting makeup on real actors and
then<00:03:00.160> filming<00:03:00.580> his<00:03:00.730> facial<00:03:00.940> expressions<00:03:01.600> and

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
then filming his facial expressions and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.449 
then filming his facial expressions and
body<00:03:01.780> movements<00:03:02.440> from<00:03:02.560> 8<00:03:02.800> different<00:03:02.980> camera

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
body movements from 8 different camera

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.370 
body movements from 8 different camera
angles<00:03:03.760> we've<00:03:04.209> created<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.660> strong<00:03:04.959> sense<00:03:05.230> of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
angles we've created a strong sense of

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:16.170 
angles we've created a strong sense of
realism<00:03:12.030> doors<00:03:13.030> your<00:03:13.590> October<00:03:14.670> yeah<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.880> do<00:03:16.030> do

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
realism doors your October yeah do do do

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.850 
realism doors your October yeah do do do
do<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:16.870> already<00:03:17.049> hi<00:03:17.170> Kenny<00:03:17.410> we're<00:03:17.590> doing<00:03:17.799> is

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
do we already hi Kenny we're doing is

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.770 
do we already hi Kenny we're doing is
then<00:03:18.070> similarly<00:03:18.820> with<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> environments

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
then similarly with the environments

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.690 
then similarly with the environments
we've<00:03:20.320> used<00:03:20.560> special<00:03:20.920> effects<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.430> create<00:03:21.670> a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
we've used special effects to create a

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.520 
we've used special effects to create a
specific<00:03:21.970> atmosphere<00:03:22.780> such<00:03:23.049> as<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> unique

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
specific atmosphere such as the unique

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.380 
specific atmosphere such as the unique
humidity<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.100> Japan<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.150> player<00:03:25.360> can

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
humidity of Japan so the player can

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.270 
humidity of Japan so the player can
experience<00:03:25.930> what<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.320> actually<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.950> be

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
experience what it's actually like to be

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.120 
experience what it's actually like to be
there<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.970> situation<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.680> players<00:03:32.950> in

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
there in that situation the players in

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.949 
there in that situation the players in
the<00:03:33.220> game<00:03:33.250> will<00:03:33.610> plate<00:03:33.850> as<00:03:34.030> an<00:03:34.120> extremely<00:03:34.630> weak

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the game will plate as an extremely weak

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.780 
the game will plate as an extremely weak
and<00:03:35.260> disadvantaged<00:03:35.890> position<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.430> relation

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
and disadvantaged position in relation

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.759 
and disadvantaged position in relation
to<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.000> shibito<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.080> attack<00:03:38.410> them<00:03:38.590> head-on

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
to the shibito so to attack them head-on

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.020 
to the shibito so to attack them head-on
is<00:03:39.160> not<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> wise<00:03:39.700> strategy

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.630 

the<00:03:44.030> volume<00:03:44.920> crucial<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.129> game<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
the volume crucial to this game is the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.250 
the volume crucial to this game is the
site<00:03:46.849> check<00:03:47.060> system<00:03:47.510> which<00:03:47.870> allows<00:03:48.109> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
site check system which allows the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.309 
site check system which allows the
player<00:03:48.469> to<00:03:48.500> see<00:03:48.890> through<00:03:49.189> the<00:03:49.340> eyes<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.640> others

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.869 

the<00:03:54.319> system<00:03:54.709> itself<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.189> intuitive<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
the system itself is intuitive and

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.940 
the system itself is intuitive and
simple<00:03:56.180> but<00:03:56.900> encourages<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:57.469> player<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.859> use

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
simple but encourages the player to use

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.580 
simple but encourages the player to use
a<00:03:58.010> wide<00:03:58.280> range<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.670> strategies<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.329> tactics

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.809 

we've<00:04:03.590> really<00:04:03.859> tried<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.069> break<00:04:04.340> new<00:04:04.519> ground

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
we've really tried to break new ground

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.949 
we've really tried to break new ground
and<00:04:05.000> create<00:04:05.269> something<00:04:05.569> totally<00:04:05.750> different

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
and create something totally different

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:16.270 
and create something totally different
with<00:04:06.439> this<00:04:06.530> project<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:15.039> think<00:04:16.039> with<00:04:16.190> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
with this project I think with the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.830 
with this project I think with the
interactivity<00:04:16.729> system<00:04:17.269> we've<00:04:17.389> developed

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
interactivity system we've developed

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.499 
interactivity system we've developed
we've<00:04:18.079> definitely<00:04:18.320> achieved<00:04:18.889> this

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.969 

letting<00:04:26.509> this<00:04:26.629> go<00:04:26.870> although<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.949> the

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
letting this go although this is the

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:28.809 
letting this go although this is the
first<00:04:28.099> release

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
first release

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.550 
first release
we<00:04:28.939> hope<00:04:29.120> Forbidden<00:04:29.539> Zone<00:04:29.569> will<00:04:30.020> develop<00:04:30.409> into

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
we hope Forbidden Zone will develop into

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.150 
we hope Forbidden Zone will develop into
a<00:04:30.680> successful<00:04:31.129> franchise

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.820 
immersed in the world of forbidden siren
it<00:04:38.820> should<00:04:39.030> be<00:04:39.150> played<00:04:39.390> alone<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:40.380> night<00:04:40.410> in
