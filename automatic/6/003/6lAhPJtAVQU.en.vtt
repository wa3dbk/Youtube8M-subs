side and like that and that anyway do

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.920 
side and like that and that anyway do
you<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:33.510> what<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.690> mean<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:34.280> bricks<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.810> then

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
you see what I mean like bricks and then

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.010 
you see what I mean like bricks and then
you're<00:02:37.080> going<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> same<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:39.030> this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
you're going to do the same for this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.590 
you're going to do the same for this
corner<00:02:41.090> start<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> 10<00:02:43.380> x<00:02:43.980> one<00:02:44.190> piece<00:02:44.600> like

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
corner start with a 10 x one piece like

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.040 
corner start with a 10 x one piece like
that<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:46.410> kind<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.160> mirror<00:02:47.670> image

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
that it's kind of like a mirror image

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.470 
that it's kind of like a mirror image
and<00:02:49.520> you're<00:02:50.520> going<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> exact<00:02:51.450> same

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
and you're going to do the exact same

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.740 
and you're going to do the exact same
thing<00:02:51.930> until<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.650> six<00:02:52.890> layers<00:02:53.130> okay<00:02:53.910> so

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
thing until you have six layers okay so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.630 
thing until you have six layers okay so
as<00:02:54.840> soon<00:02:54.990> as<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.470> six<00:02:55.770> layers<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.310> both

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
as soon as you have six layers on both

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.290 
as soon as you have six layers on both
sides<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.960> bricks<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.500> should<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> do

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
sides just like the bricks I should I do

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.560 
sides just like the bricks I should I do
it<00:03:00.300> should<00:03:00.330> look<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.150> know<00:03:03.210> it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
it should look like this and I know it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.530 
it should look like this and I know it
doesn't<00:03:03.780> look<00:03:03.900> done<00:03:04.140> yet<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.590> I'll<00:03:05.510> show<00:03:06.510> you

doesn't look done yet and I'll show you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.480 
doesn't look done yet and I'll show you
what's<00:03:06.750> gonna<00:03:06.870> happen<00:03:07.230> if<00:03:07.740> you're<00:03:08.250> actually

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
what's gonna happen if you're actually

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.040 
what's gonna happen if you're actually
doing<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.120> which<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:09.630> going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> assume

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
doing this which I'm going to assume

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.540 
doing this which I'm going to assume
three-quarters<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.710> you<00:03:10.890> are<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.250> you're

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
three-quarters of you are not you're

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.180 
three-quarters of you are not you're
just<00:03:11.730> watching<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.950> you're<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.100> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
just watching this you're going to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.990 
just watching this you're going to
notice<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.730> have<00:03:14.780> 18<00:03:15.780> x<00:03:16.080> one<00:03:16.320> piece<00:03:16.590> left

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
notice that you have 18 x one piece left

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.760 
notice that you have 18 x one piece left
this<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.330> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> ipad<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
this is going to be so the ipad so the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.530 
this is going to be so the ipad so the
ipad<00:03:23.160> when<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:24.170> sits<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.970> doesn't

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
ipad when it sits like this it doesn't

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.100 
ipad when it sits like this it doesn't
slide<00:03:28.170> off<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:30.360> doesn't<00:03:30.690> look<00:03:30.810> very<00:03:30.840> good

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
slide off and it doesn't look very good

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.380 
slide off and it doesn't look very good
but<00:03:31.530> we're<00:03:32.400> going<00:03:32.490> to<00:03:32.550> make<00:03:32.640> some<00:03:32.700> adjustments

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
but we're going to make some adjustments

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.770 
but we're going to make some adjustments
so<00:03:34.200> you're<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.770> put<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.780> like

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
so you're just going to put this like

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.980 
so you're just going to put this like
somewhere<00:03:37.170> like<00:03:37.440> right<00:03:37.740> there<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:39.960> that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
somewhere like right there just so that

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.580 
somewhere like right there just so that
when<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.560> put<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.800> ipad<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.750> doesn't<00:03:43.140> fall

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
when you put the ipad in it doesn't fall

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.780 
when you put the ipad in it doesn't fall
it's<00:03:43.980> pretty<00:03:44.220> smoothly<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:46.070> if<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.550> can

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
it's pretty smoothly on and if you can

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.390 
it's pretty smoothly on and if you can
always<00:03:48.210> like<00:03:48.420> adjust<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.250> you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
always like adjust it so like if you

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.390 
always like adjust it so like if you
wanted<00:03:50.820> if<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:52.020> wanted<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.830> be<00:03:52.860> more

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
wanted if you wanted this to be more

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.240 
wanted if you wanted this to be more
like<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:54.030> right<00:03:54.560> then<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.830> would<00:03:56.010> want

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
like up right then you would want

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.060 
like up right then you would want
instead<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:57.060> moving<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.450> back<00:03:57.720> these<00:03:58.650> come

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
instead of moving this back these come

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.740 
instead of moving this back these come
off<00:03:59.160> really<00:03:59.340> easily<00:03:59.580> you<00:04:00.180> would<00:04:00.330> take<00:04:00.510> them

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
off really easily you would take them

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.420 
off really easily you would take them
and<00:04:01.080> put<00:04:01.140> them<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.920> as<00:04:02.300> close<00:04:03.650> near<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:05.160> as

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
and put them like as close near here as

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.340 
and put them like as close near here as
possible<00:04:06.140> because<00:04:07.140> then<00:04:08.130> um<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:09.720> won't<00:04:09.960> flip

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
possible because then um this won't flip

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.140 
possible because then um this won't flip
like<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.430> would<00:04:11.580> be<00:04:11.700> kind<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.000> bad

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
like that and that would be kind of bad

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.439 
like that and that would be kind of bad
cuz<00:04:12.560> might<00:04:13.560> damage<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.070> ipad<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.840> then

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.050 

then<00:04:19.449> it's<00:04:19.989> basically<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.669> works

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
then it's basically like that it works

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.260 
then it's basically like that it works
and<00:04:22.449> I<00:04:22.660> did<00:04:22.990> 16<00:04:23.770> x<00:04:23.889> 32<00:04:24.340> base<00:04:24.490> plate<00:04:24.759> purposely

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
and I did 16 x 32 base plate purposely

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.189 
and I did 16 x 32 base plate purposely
so<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.199> would<00:04:26.470> fit<00:04:27.120> really<00:04:28.120> snugly<00:04:28.300> like

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
so that I would fit really snugly like

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.589 
so that I would fit really snugly like
that<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:31.660> can<00:04:31.919> make<00:04:32.919> these<00:04:33.099> closer<00:04:33.490> or<00:04:34.030> it

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
that and you can make these closer or it

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.379 
that and you can make these closer or it
doesn't<00:04:34.810> matter<00:04:35.050> could<00:04:35.830> even<00:04:36.009> put<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.550> well

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
doesn't matter could even put it well

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.350 
doesn't matter could even put it well
let's<00:04:37.720> say<00:04:37.870> if<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.020> can<00:04:38.349> put<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.490> as<00:04:39.880> upright

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
let's say if you can put it as upright

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.999 
let's say if you can put it as upright
as<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.780> will<00:04:40.900> go<00:04:40.930> yeah<00:04:41.229> you<00:04:41.259> can<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.830> it

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
as it will go yeah you can and it

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.659 
as it will go yeah you can and it
doesn't<00:04:42.360> doesn't<00:04:43.360> fill<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:45.039> my<00:04:45.400> camera

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
doesn't doesn't fill a to my camera

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:54.180 
doesn't doesn't fill a to my camera
inflection<00:04:46.389> uh<00:04:47.229> so<00:04:48.190> now<00:04:48.580> i<00:04:50.580> guess<00:04:52.889> i'm<00:04:53.889> going

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
inflection uh so now i guess i'm going

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.950 
inflection uh so now i guess i'm going
to<00:04:54.280> show<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.460> how<00:04:54.610> it<00:04:55.270> looks<00:04:55.300> with<00:04:55.750> like<00:04:55.930> a
