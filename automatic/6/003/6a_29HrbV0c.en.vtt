 today we have the twentieth train 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 cheaters, we have already caught less than 20 to 20 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.190
 release on the same 20 videos who did not know 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.960
 here prompted and today I 'm sure we 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.940
 should find such a simple 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.449
 ohrenitelnogo polina teachers to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.680
 bon bon questions it will be like this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 I promise you drove what you thought gentlemen 20 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 release requires strange cards today 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 Bunny we have cards guys black gold from 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.360
 aspects will show mastery 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.520
 games than loyalty and bare aim 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.590
 what they still fall now 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 screaming one guy 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 unfortunately you are not killing she is 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.000
 following about this player will be 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 print only that he will 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.250
 direct through walls or how are you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.600
 find out places that don’t say 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 so much on tips because I don't know 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.809
 who else but in the meantime he's going 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.309
 two 1 remember enough purely and that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.969
 were interesting so it turned out that there 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 type of aiming was but in my opinion by default 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.580
 made it hard for me to say seba anyway 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 I haven't played the map so often 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 times two three 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.520
 sit with a knife 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.100
 take that pair but no I'm not that simple 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.100
 and now what will I take from 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 knife and so I think will not take and take 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.189
 so meanwhile the same remind that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 that dude 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.590
 mistakes are important for us now 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.579
 notice that is just that he will react 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.060
 I saw in went through. you will not 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.220
 will you 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.030
 It is controlled and so I understand what type 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.399
 long till she tries to shoot off 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.399
 gets body if armor saves 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.369
 suspect on the other hand yet what 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.380
 what will happen and wait as he is now 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.080
 I heard the moon trout as he saw 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.530
 the one that they have already gone 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.110
 suggest that this is just info I don't know 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.200
 maybe different 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.269
 seriously most likely this is because the warriors are about 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.660
 his wash the floor above therefore rather 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:19.880
 most likely said slaughtered himself 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.830
 I wanted to cut the cut itself like this 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.069
 Here you will know how to show off 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.989
 in front of our people the mole of tait thought 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.590
 that's not like 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.569
 and again he took it because he didn’t 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.480
 so feels really ransom 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.099
 easy that just takes it away 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.319
 Of course I was straining this fact 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.970
 we are constantly with us where the enemy from 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.590
 this of course can be assumed then 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.780
 what are chats 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.060
 but god bluntly obviously everything 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.310
 such was not and here I am playing the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.600
 All of these goals here three times on this 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.850
 map that is, these places that are 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.250
 sand raid for me there will be no default 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.829
 we may not default them only 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.540
 for me, for example, such or I myself just 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.880
 I can not exactly understand but to eight will run away 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.100
 see by false and guess that is 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.049
 basically ok request token 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.970
 default position but I guess so 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.090
 I suppose he has only one left 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.270
 two rounds and he decides to take them 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.550
 machine gun 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.890
 machine gun goes gave yes yes I saw it 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.390
 that the guy there stood himself between passes 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.090
 behind the back will go fish of the room 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.030
 flew as killed killed kiev 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.920
 rambo suspect rambo there's nothing here 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.590
 say mom said that the fish therefore 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.350
 rambo what if the round decides already then 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.100
 sawing his type no these are my guys he 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.710
 He understands in that 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.510
 last in re matches is the length of nobody 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.330
 find understand understand that myasko something 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.060
 next and goes after him but to 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.220
 Unfortunately no one finds well that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.860
 at least i can be sure of that 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.400
 20 release will be this rather controversial 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.990
 for many of you i'm more than sure 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.450
 what will some say 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.880
 type he chitak but for me the guy played 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.030
 clean and therefore not enough 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.580
 evidence 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.400
 well guys this ends 20 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.250
 release boys cheaters do not forget to put 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.080
 likes to 4 die faster and to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.610
 they generally died well or so in the ass 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.590
 here stole well there that we ourselves think up 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.600
 in the comments write in the comments 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.070
 think or that this guy was clean 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.510
 or is it a cheater and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.550
