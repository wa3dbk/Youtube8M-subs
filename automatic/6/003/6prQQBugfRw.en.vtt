00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 now friends as they are now is 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.629
 Minecraft tutorial translator is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.879
 they ask what it is 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.940
 is how the title says create the 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.560
 monsters and guardians for your village 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.939
 one thing you have to know these 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
 guardians and monsters that can 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.830
 be that they are two do not appear here in the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.730
 these eggs and all that you can not 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.850
 generate so egg 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.780
 to generate these monsters you will need 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.780
 blocks of snow 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.000
 leiter and a good iron block 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.930
 iron blocks good but in cials 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.260
 the one of snow the one of snows putting the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.660
 snow blocks well and after 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.360
 check on the head ready this 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.309
 creature made of snow I do not like me 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.309
 so much but if it serves to protect your 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.460
 village this creature sometimes when it 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.650
 move leaves it 's like snow in on the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.690
 ground 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.070
 then very annoying after leaving there 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.620
 have to remove because I do not like how 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.230
 you see this also resists very little 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.320
 he wonders what does this 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.870
 creature can throw snowballs 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.050
 something curious is that right now it is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.660
 moving is what I do not like about haas and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.920
 pieces of snow are everywhere 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.540
 also if one tries to know how to do 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.010
 under the ground something like that if you have 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.550
 surcharge under the land samorÃ© towards the 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.260
 nothing 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.010
 that's why I really like doing this 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.010
 a lot is not very advisable 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.790
 kills are my skeletons clippers good 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.730
 be in fibers not but many are killed 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.560
 other species of enemies and good the 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.830
 golems as it is believed that they have been 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.780
 guardians of iron is that way we have to 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.930
 to form as a guy like that something little body 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.930
 A) Yes 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.039
 well once done this with boxes of 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.039
 iron we also do the same 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.509
 is 10 times better than pumpkin 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.340
 because it dies again this killing 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.560
 the enemies easier and resists a 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 heap you have to there if you get the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.370
 back of 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.129
 if you have the diamond sword more 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.140
 late like this more than 10 hits or something 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.310
 so to kill him I think so 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.349
 I want this one resists almost if we tell each other 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.400
 to the dragon of the film then the creature 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.400
 that resists more in maicao 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.870
 is these can not kill can not kill 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.930
 clippers if you want to guide creepers 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.100
 well they are going to have to get this 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.470
 the other something like that 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.360
 Well, that's all 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.190
 back by dress if you want more 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.190
 Minecraft tutorials formalize goodbye
