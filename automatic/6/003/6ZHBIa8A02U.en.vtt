00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.880
 ah 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.199
 Hi, I'm an expert in art 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.259
 of sugar and today I 'm going to show you what 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 simple that is to use the smooth malte cake 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.009
 play 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.410
 let's just take the smooth sea what 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.740
 let's cut it into pieces and place it in 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.320
 a container suitable for microwaves 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.590
 the power of the microwaves vary 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.780
 depending on the amount of volts 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.410
 that they have in this case I'm going to put 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 mine for about 60 seconds if any 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.860
 it can be a little more or less than time 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.930
 while he did wrong it melts I go to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 prepare a little orange 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.110
 to use in the molds of small fish that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110
 I have here 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.860
 I have two molds of different sizes 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.700
 can observe that when he did wrong 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.650
 is ready is very hot it comes out 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.780
 boiling of the microwave with many 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.729
 air bubbles 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.750
 I will place the other color in the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.270
 microwave to prepare it 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.670
 can see the bubbles let's leave it 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 rest for a few seconds do not try to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.580
 rushing the process is very dangerous 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.680
 shaking it or shaking it we should use it 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.540
 gloves always to protect our 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.979
 hands in this case I will use my 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.520
 favorite tool a toothpick 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.130
 Easy to use and easy to get this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.410
 it's very simple the container has a 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.500
 good handle and I'll start 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.570
 pour slowly we do not want to do it 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.090
 very fast to not incorporate bubbles 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.369
 of air be careful not to fill the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.100
 mold too with my tool 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.190
 favorite the toothpick I will fill 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.170
 he did wrong to the edges all the 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.040
 corners until completing the mold 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 completely 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.379
 if they have small air bubbles in 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:18.519
 the surface with a chef's torch or 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:21.370
 they believe that that applies the heat in the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.579
 surface quickly with a small 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.939
 tap and it does it very fast and it is 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.939
 ready 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.520
 the orange color is not ready 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.940
 still so I'm going to give you another 40 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.940
 seconds 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.300
 purist that he has family 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.010
 I'm going to put some yellow in the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.560
 another mold 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.080
 in the deepest part 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.069
 As you can see this is very simple 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.810
 do 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.810
 snap in the western 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.599
 same 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.980
 and will stand for a few minutes until 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.980
 other color is ready 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.120
 we are going to check it now 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.599
 is ready and well prepared with bubbles 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.599
 of air 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.409
 when you are working with bad nexus 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.390
 have patience is very important to try 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:34.209
 of rushing the process by either using 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.209
 sugar or made it wrong is not a good idea 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.130
 try to maintain speed and 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.130
 separated sugar 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.990
 while we let the orange rest 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.430
 let's check our little fish 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.620
 yellow 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.780
 and we can see that there is still a 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.920
 little movement in him and his mother that 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.450
 it means that it is not ready yet 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.470
 now let's pour the orange color 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:10.260
 slowly reaching all extremes 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.260
 some little drops I did not hurry 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.139
 this mold is quite deep but not 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.199
 about fill 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.940
 use your toothpick and carry the and 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:26.340
 somalia to the edges 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.720
 this is better done like this instead of 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.630
 fill it too 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.910
 and I'm going to make a mix the colors in 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.640
 center 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.420
 and that's all he needs now what 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.420
 let's let it rest 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.229
 once the molds have cooled 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.919
 the mold can simply demold 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.919
 pushing the 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.730
 and prepare to incorporate it into your 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.000
 project mine is a cake with the theme 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.000
 Marine 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.729
 I'm going to submerge the bottom part of the fish 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.729
 in the made melted evil 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.419
 and I'm going to paste it on the cake 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.700
 if you can see what I'm hitting 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.190
 directly in the fondant or cover 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.190
 of sugar that simple 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.740
 now I'm going to delay the second fish 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:32.419
 I'm going to repeat the process I submerge the fish 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.419
 in the made bad hot 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.770
 and I'm going to stick it next to this coral 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.610
 it's still a bit soft what I 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.880
 lets move it and give it some 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.880
 movement 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.590
 and that's how it gets incorporated and sticks in 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.590
 pieces of did wrong in their cakes 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.140
 ah
