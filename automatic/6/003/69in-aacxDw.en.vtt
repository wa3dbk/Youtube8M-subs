00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.160
 belts key chains and bracelets with knots 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.839
 sailors using cords strings omar 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.939
 or more than a little thick and different 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.830
 colors you can get fabrics that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.130
 will be a reason for practical objects 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.599
 personal or for gifts the materials 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.759
 we can find them in stores 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.680
 dedicated to cordelerÃ­a in 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.840
 specific establishments of 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.960
 naval items and in department stores 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.469
 the ropes or ropes ropes either 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 jute or artificial fiber hemp 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 the small bracelet has been achieved 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.680
 by two threads of equal thickness but 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350
 of different color based on knitting the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.450
 each other before executing it is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.540
 convenient to perform some tests of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579
 interlaced as a terminal element is 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.950
 uses a typical closure accessory 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 sailor located equally in 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.280
 naval establishments naturally 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 this application is made of brass or copper 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 The length of the bracelet will depend on 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 which must be achieved and its six 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.159
 integral elements must be told that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.780
 almost a third of the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.390
 Cord length when advancing 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.729
 progressively 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.920
 and the accompanying drawings show 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.170
 clearly the necessary amount of thread 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.150
 to get a gradual breakthrough and so 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.979
 same as knotting has to be done 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.930
 in the metal accessory so that 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.080
 develop the braid of threads starting 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.119
 of the same the end both in the belt 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520
 as in the keychain is obtained based on 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.740
 interlaced to get 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.830
 about one meter of belt will 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 they require about 15 meters of cord 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.790
 start braiding is necessary 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.700
 have a splint with three nails 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.740
 to have a starting point to the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.660
 needle or central nail you pass a 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.539
 rope or cord that at least has 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.729
 two meters long on the left 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.580
 a five meter rope and the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.170
 right another eight meters of this 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.600
 way a length will be achieved 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.560
 equivalent according to the schemes 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.149
 that are accompanied by a meter in length 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.519
 the longest threads envelop the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.680
 others that remain intense or in 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.090
 straight line as seen in the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.860
 drawings 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.680
 when the length has been achieved 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.540
 desired the ropes are returned around 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.629
 of the buckle and interweaves a piece in 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.430
 the same previous fabric to perform 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.590
 the terminals are knotted two pieces 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.300
 same between crossing the and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.370
 developing them according to the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.440
 four drawings that were exposed 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.360
 in which you see the braiding of the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.450
 materials that constitute them up 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.480
 get the work already finished we take for 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.489
 finished the article if you need 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.069
 back to listen to me give the play all 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.069
 the times you want thanks
