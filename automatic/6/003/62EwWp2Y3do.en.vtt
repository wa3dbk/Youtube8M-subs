00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
of them one by one so first I will put

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.830

it<00:04:22.240> right<00:04:22.419> on<00:04:22.810> top<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.729> samsung<00:04:24.729> galaxy<00:04:25.150> note

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
it right on top of a samsung galaxy note

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.350 
it right on top of a samsung galaxy note
4<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.260> as<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.560> can<00:04:26.710> see<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.610> note<00:04:27.910> 4<00:04:28.210> is

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
4 and as you can see the note 4 is

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.780 
4 and as you can see the note 4 is
slightly<00:04:28.930> smaller<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.680> almost<00:04:30.430> every

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
slightly smaller in almost every

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.420 
slightly smaller in almost every
dimension<00:04:31.590> except<00:04:32.590> for<00:04:32.800> thickness<00:04:33.040> which<00:04:33.340> I

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
dimension except for thickness which I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.710 
dimension except for thickness which I
believe<00:04:33.760> is<00:04:33.970> very<00:04:34.000> very<00:04:34.449> close<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:35.220> terms<00:04:36.220> of

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
believe is very very close in terms of

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.640 
believe is very very close in terms of
length<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.770> Nexus<00:04:39.760> 6<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.030> taller<00:04:40.360> it's<00:04:41.229> wider

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
length the Nexus 6 is taller it's wider

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.460 
length the Nexus 6 is taller it's wider
as<00:04:41.979> well<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:43.440> almost<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:45.160> same<00:04:45.400> thickness<00:04:45.669> as

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
as well and almost the same thickness as

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.920 
as well and almost the same thickness as
the<00:04:47.470> Nexus<00:04:47.800> 6<00:04:48.039> so<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:49.030> is<00:04:49.090> how<00:04:49.330> they<00:04:49.539> compare

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
the Nexus 6 so this is how they compare

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.159 
the Nexus 6 so this is how they compare
in<00:04:50.169> size<00:04:50.400> they<00:04:51.400> feel<00:04:51.669> very<00:04:51.880> good<00:04:52.150> both<00:04:52.539> feel

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
in size they feel very good both feel

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.409
