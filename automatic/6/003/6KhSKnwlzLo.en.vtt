00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
hello everybody this is my basically a

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.059 
hello everybody this is my basically a
tool<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.330> developing<00:00:06.680> with<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.830> spare

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
tool that I'm developing with my spare

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
tool that I'm developing with my spare
time<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.610> spent<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.179> few<00:00:09.389> hours<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:09.780> this

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
time I spent about a few hours on this

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.900 
time I spent about a few hours on this
maybe<00:00:10.080> two<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.590> three<00:00:10.620> maybe<00:00:11.309> three<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.700> four

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
maybe two to three maybe three to four

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150 
maybe two to three maybe three to four
actually<00:00:12.059> I'm<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:13.110> higher<00:00:13.799> end<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
actually I'm on the higher end of the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.919 
actually I'm on the higher end of the
timeline<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.509> spend<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> little

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
timeline and this but I spend a little

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.330 
timeline and this but I spend a little
bit<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.139> time<00:00:16.320> using<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> knowledge<00:00:17.160> I've

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
bit my time using the knowledge I've

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.810 
bit my time using the knowledge I've
been<00:00:17.460> acquiring<00:00:17.880> over<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> few<00:00:19.609> months<00:00:20.609> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
been acquiring over the few months of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.060 
been acquiring over the few months of
learning<00:00:21.210> unreal<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:22.230> develop<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> tool<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.039> I

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
learning unreal to develop a tool that I

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.970 
learning unreal to develop a tool that I
think<00:00:23.100> people<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.640> use<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.180> help<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:24.980> you

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
think people can use to help them you

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.189 
think people can use to help them you
know<00:00:26.039> paint<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.640> basic<00:00:27.210> geometry<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.140> is

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
know paint from basic geometry this is

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
know paint from basic geometry this is

just a teaser trailer of just to show
how<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.420> kind<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> works<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.679> absolutely

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
how it kind of works but it's absolutely

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
donation and you know encouraged but I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.170 
donation and you know encouraged but I
don't<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> tool<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
don't think this is a tool that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.720 
don't think this is a tool that
necessarily<00:00:42.870> needs<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.800> cost<00:00:44.100> at

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
necessarily needs to have some cost at

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.299 
necessarily needs to have some cost at
least<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.320> low<00:00:46.920> end<00:00:47.129> but

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
least as of now it's very low end but

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
least as of now it's very low end but
maybe<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> future<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.660> thing<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
maybe in the future when this thing to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.500 
maybe in the future when this thing to
become<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.530> big<00:00:49.700> maybe<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> mean<00:00:51.300> even

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
become really big maybe but I mean even

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
become really big maybe but I mean even
then<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> don't<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.230> important<00:00:52.730> so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
then I don't think it's important so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
then I don't think it's important so
this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.969> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> how<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.329> looks<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.870> just

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this is kind of how it looks I just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.049 
this is kind of how it looks I just
reset<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.370> whatever<00:00:56.489> reason<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.910> look

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
reset it like for whatever reason I look

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.010 
reset it like for whatever reason I look
off<00:00:57.239> into<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> different<00:00:57.570> part<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> world

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
off into a different part of the world

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
off into a different part of the world
but<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.359> real-time

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
but you know you have some real-time

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.599 
but you know you have some real-time
lighting<00:01:01.079> using<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> powerful<00:01:02.100> lighting

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
lighting using the powerful lighting

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.729 
lighting using the powerful lighting
engine<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.000> unreal<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> set<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.619> your

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
engine in unreal you can set up your

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
engine in unreal you can set up your
scene<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:06.090> learn<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> paint<00:01:06.720> some

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
scene and like learn how to paint some

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.530 
scene and like learn how to paint some
basic<00:01:07.439> geometry<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.220> gonna<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:09.479> gonna

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
basic geometry I'm gonna have I'm gonna

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
basic geometry I'm gonna have I'm gonna
be<00:01:09.720> updating<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.439> cast<00:01:10.740> models<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
be updating this with cast models and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.859 
be updating this with cast models and
statues<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.600> really

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
statues but as of now it's just really

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.050 
statues but as of now it's just really
like<00:01:16.080> bare-bones<00:01:16.500> simple<00:01:17.250> even<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:17.909> gonna

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like bare-bones simple even I'm gonna

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
like bare-bones simple even I'm gonna
have<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.509> couldn't<00:01:18.720> arrange<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
have it so they couldn't arrange the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
have it so they couldn't arrange the
orly<00:01:19.979> randomly<00:01:20.970> arranged<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> objects

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
orly randomly arranged the the objects

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.640 
orly randomly arranged the the objects
in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> scene<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:25.020> right<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in the scene but right now that's like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.310 
in the scene but right now that's like
more<00:01:26.250> complicated<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> need<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.229> be

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
more complicated then I need it to be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
more complicated then I need it to be
just<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.490> simple<00:01:29.729> very

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just just right now it's a simple very

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
just just right now it's a simple very
simple<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> change<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> materials<00:01:32.369> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
simple you can change the materials like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.219 
simple you can change the materials like
you<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> cone<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.049> for

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you see one is for the cone two is for

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.950 
you see one is for the cone two is for
the<00:01:34.320> cube<00:01:34.619> three<00:01:34.979> sphere<00:01:35.460> four<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.509> cylinder

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the cube three sphere four is cylinder

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
the cube three sphere four is cylinder
five<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> platform<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> six<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> reset

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
five it's a platform and six is to reset

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
five it's a platform and six is to reset
the<00:01:39.390> materials<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.009> there's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the materials and you can see there's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.410 
the materials and you can see there's
different<00:01:41.250> kinds<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> materials<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
different kinds of materials you can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.910 
different kinds of materials you can
toggle<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.560> keep<00:01:43.740> pressing

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
toggle and just you just keep pressing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.620 
toggle and just you just keep pressing
that<00:01:44.100> number<00:01:44.399> there's<00:01:44.880> no<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> kind<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that number there's no way to kind of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
that number there's no way to kind of
keep<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.170> back<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> forth<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.040> just

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
keep it going back and forth I just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
keep it going back and forth I just
wanted<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> keep<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.450> simple<00:01:48.600> maybe<00:01:48.899> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
wanted to keep it really simple maybe in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.719 
wanted to keep it really simple maybe in
the<00:01:49.290> future<00:01:49.409> I'll<00:01:49.649> make<00:01:50.159> something<00:01:50.430> where<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the future I'll make something where you

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
the future I'll make something where you
can<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.270> click<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.899> it'll<00:01:52.200> go

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
can actually just click and it'll go

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
can actually just click and it'll go
back<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.680> forth<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.750> said<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
back and forth but like I said this is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
back and forth but like I said this is
free<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.520> shouldn't<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.909> too<00:01:57.060> big<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
free so it's it shouldn't be too big of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.209 
free so it's it shouldn't be too big of
a<00:01:57.360> deal<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.689> least<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> tool<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
a deal at least you have a tool that you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
a deal at least you have a tool that you
can<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.540> here's<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> better

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
can use but here's some of the better

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350 
can use but here's some of the better
features<00:02:01.290> where<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.360> toggle

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
features where you can actually toggle

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.109 
features where you can actually toggle
the<00:02:03.960> daylight<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.340> pitch<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.880> y'all

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the daylight and it's a pitch in y'all

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
the daylight and it's a pitch in y'all
so<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> figure<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.500> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
so you have to figure that out for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080 
so you have to figure that out for
yourself<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.670> happening

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
yourself but that is what is happening

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.330 
yourself but that is what is happening
this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.360> affecting<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> pitch<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.649> then

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
this is affecting the pitch and then

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
this is affecting the pitch and then
this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> affecting<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.450> yaw

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
this is affecting the yaw

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.740 
this is affecting the yaw
of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:14.310> lighting<00:02:14.670> setup<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.330> know<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.659> you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
of the lighting setup you know so you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
of the lighting setup you know so you
can<00:02:15.840> set<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.439> how<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:16.890> want<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.159> date

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
can set up like how if you want the date

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.839 
can set up like how if you want the date
time<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.239> be<00:02:18.420> changed<00:02:19.230> materials<00:02:19.739> again<00:02:20.069> to

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
time to be changed materials again to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.059 
time to be changed materials again to
whatever<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.239> want<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.560> let's<00:02:22.920> just

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
whatever you want you know let's just

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.940 
whatever you want you know let's just
make<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.430> matte<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.720> then<00:02:25.530> make<00:02:25.799> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
make that matte and then make the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.819 
make that matte and then make the
platform<00:02:26.159> red<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.180> don't<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.200> dynamic

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
platform red I don't have dynamic

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.890 
platform red I don't have dynamic
reflections<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:29.940> indirect<00:02:30.420> lighting<00:02:30.659> yet

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
reflections or indirect lighting yet

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.479 
reflections or indirect lighting yet
that's<00:02:31.379> working<00:02:32.209> not<00:02:33.209> working<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:35.459> my

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
that's working not working to my to my

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.580 
that's working not working to my to my
standards<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.540> light<00:02:36.690> reflections<00:02:37.200> toggle

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
standards the light reflections toggle

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.910 
standards the light reflections toggle
seems<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:39.450> light<00:02:39.629> reflection<00:02:40.170> toggle<00:02:40.709> is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
seems to the light reflection toggle is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.089 
seems to the light reflection toggle is
not<00:02:41.989> working<00:02:42.989> either<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.709> there's<00:02:43.890> like<00:02:44.040> a

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
not working either but there's like a

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.920 
not working either but there's like a
few<00:02:44.370> bugs<00:02:44.609> like<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.879> said<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:45.750> at<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
few bugs like I said but right at the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
few bugs like I said but right at the
moment<00:02:46.049> it's<00:02:46.440> mostly<00:02:46.890> everything<00:02:47.159> is<00:02:47.459> working

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
moment it's mostly everything is working

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.729 
moment it's mostly everything is working
you<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.150> hide<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.510> hood<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.930> want<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
you can hide the hood if you want you

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.860 
you can hide the hood if you want you
can<00:02:49.859> full<00:02:50.069> screen<00:02:50.370> which<00:02:50.489> I'm<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:51.389> gonna<00:02:51.690> do

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
can full screen which I'm not gonna do

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.789 
can full screen which I'm not gonna do
right<00:02:52.019> now<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:53.209> then<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.870> set<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> sky

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
right now and then you can set the sky

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.039 
right now and then you can set the sky
brightness<00:02:56.040> maybe<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.549> guy's<00:02:56.819> too<00:02:57.150> dark<00:02:57.840> or

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
brightness maybe this guy's too dark or

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.379 
brightness maybe this guy's too dark or
maybe<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.409> want<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.799> be<00:02:58.920> brighter<00:02:59.400> or<00:03:00.359> a

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
maybe you want it to be brighter or a

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.479 
maybe you want it to be brighter or a
darker<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.739> can<00:03:01.889> get<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.220> bit<00:03:02.400> more

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
darker so you can get a little bit more

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.030 
darker so you can get a little bit more
natural-looking<00:03:03.000> light<00:03:03.540> setup<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.739> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
natural-looking light setup you know and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.270 
natural-looking light setup you know and
again<00:03:05.609> you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.879> change<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.299> material<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:08.220> I

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
again you can change the material and I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.740 
again you can change the material and I
have<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> few<00:03:08.639> materials<00:03:08.760> again<00:03:09.269> I'm<00:03:09.359> gonna<00:03:09.480> as

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
have a few materials again I'm gonna as

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.170 
have a few materials again I'm gonna as
I<00:03:10.349> go<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:11.010> change<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.730> materials

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
I go on and I change it to the materials

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.809 
I go on and I change it to the materials
options<00:03:12.720> are<00:03:12.950> way<00:03:13.950> more<00:03:13.980> dynamic<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
options are way more dynamic and you

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.300 
options are way more dynamic and you
have<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> lot<00:03:15.209> more<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.480> choose<00:03:15.510> from<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.310> also

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
have a lot more to choose from and also

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.680 
have a lot more to choose from and also
remove<00:03:17.609> that<00:03:17.760> glare<00:03:18.060> man<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.389> glares

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
remove that glare man that glares

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.409 
remove that glare man that glares
intense<00:03:19.019> unless<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.680> want<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:19.919> paint<00:03:20.099> that

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
intense unless you want to paint that

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.300 
intense unless you want to paint that
that's<00:03:21.419> very<00:03:21.510> natural<00:03:21.870> right<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.739> what<00:03:23.040> would

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
that's very natural right is what would
