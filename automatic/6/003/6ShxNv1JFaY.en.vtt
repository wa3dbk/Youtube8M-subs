meaning it is going to have a lot of
trouble<00:01:56.960> getting<00:01:57.960> over<00:01:58.110> Slifer<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
trouble getting over Slifer now all you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.830 
trouble getting over Slifer now all you
have<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.600> protect<00:02:00.930> Slifer<00:02:01.850> which<00:02:02.850> like

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
have to do is protect Slifer which like

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.609 
have to do is protect Slifer which like
as<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.549> wat<00:02:05.939> neck<00:02:06.229> because<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
as I put it in my wat neck because this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.740 
as I put it in my wat neck because this
deck<00:02:07.890> has<00:02:08.099> no<00:02:08.129> problem<00:02:08.879> maintaining<00:02:09.119> monsters

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
deck has no problem maintaining monsters

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.229 
deck has no problem maintaining monsters
on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.899> field<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.550> will<00:02:11.550> usually<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
on the field I will usually have the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.680 
on the field I will usually have the
tributes<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
tributes for it and it can you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.170 
tributes for it and it can you
that<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.050> an<00:02:14.200> alternate<00:02:14.620> wind<00:02:14.770> condition<00:02:15.180> but

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
that is an alternate wind condition but

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
that is an alternate wind condition but
yeah<00:02:16.540> because<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.230> plenty<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.590> stuff

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
yeah because it I have plenty of stuff

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.480 
yeah because it I have plenty of stuff
to<00:02:17.920> protect<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> basically<00:02:20.740> if<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.160> have

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
to protect it so basically if you have

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.090 
to protect it so basically if you have
the<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.790> deck<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.410> control<00:02:23.770> style

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
the right deck this is it control style

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.270 
the right deck this is it control style
card<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.790> want<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.210> control<00:02:25.570> style<00:02:25.870> deck

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
card you want to in a control style deck

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.890 
card you want to in a control style deck
but<00:02:27.280> yeah<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.850> would<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.690> get

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
but yeah I would think that if you get

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.490 
but yeah I would think that if you get
this<00:02:29.050> out<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.450> play<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> smart<00:02:32.110> like

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
this out and you you play a smart like

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.680 
this out and you you play a smart like
don't<00:02:32.890> run<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.460> into<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.820> deep<00:02:34.150> prison<00:02:34.570> or

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
don't run it into a deep prison or

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.090 
don't run it into a deep prison or
something<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.290> know<00:02:35.410> play<00:02:35.740> smart

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
something like that you know play smart

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.510 
something like that you know play smart
but<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.270> can<00:02:37.450> get<00:02:37.570> this<00:02:37.720> out<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:39.040> very

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
but if you can get this out you are very

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.210 
but if you can get this out you are very
well<00:02:39.970> set<00:02:40.930> up<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.510> win<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.990> game<00:02:44.230> now

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
well set up for you to win that game now

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.820 
well set up for you to win that game now
potential<00:02:45.820> decks<00:02:46.060> obviously<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.800> is

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
potential decks obviously I think it is

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.010 
potential decks obviously I think it is
good<00:02:48.130> in<00:02:48.250> watts<00:02:48.550> because<00:02:49.090> wats<00:02:49.330> are<00:02:49.570> very<00:02:49.810> good

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
good in watts because wats are very good

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.390 
good in watts because wats are very good
of<00:02:50.110> protecting<00:02:50.530> themselves<00:02:50.620> they're<00:02:51.220> very

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
of protecting themselves they're very

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.730 
of protecting themselves they're very
good<00:02:51.550> protecting<00:02:51.970> other<00:02:52.120> cards<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:53.440> came

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
good protecting other cards they came

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.550 
good protecting other cards they came
and<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.060> said<00:02:55.180> there<00:02:55.540> will<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.840> treats<00:02:56.080> for

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and like I said there will be treats for

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.880 
and like I said there will be treats for
it<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.090> my<00:02:58.270> wat<00:02:58.510> burn<00:02:58.930> deck<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.740> it's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
it and this is my wat burn deck so it's

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.980 
it and this is my wat burn deck so it's
probably<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.430> ideal<00:03:00.940> card<00:03:01.270> here<00:03:01.600> I'm

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
probably not the ideal card here I'm

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.350 
probably not the ideal card here I'm
going<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.710> build<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.070> wat<00:03:03.310> Slifer<00:03:03.880> deck<00:03:04.060> which

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
going to build a wat Slifer deck which

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.300 
going to build a wat Slifer deck which
actually<00:03:04.570> runs<00:03:04.930> blue<00:03:05.170> Slifer<00:03:05.410> focus<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
actually runs blue Slifer focus on the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.060 
actually runs blue Slifer focus on the
sly<00:03:06.490> for<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> bit<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:08.080> I'm<00:03:08.320> going<00:03:08.710> to<00:03:08.830> work<00:03:08.920> on

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
sly for a bit so I'm going to work on

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.860 
sly for a bit so I'm going to work on
that<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.430> might<00:03:09.730> get<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.090> deck<00:03:10.300> profile<00:03:10.690> up

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
that I might get that deck profile up

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.470 
that I might get that deck profile up
sometime<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.250> think<00:03:12.400> wats<00:03:12.910> are<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.240> very

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
sometime but I think wats are a very

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.000 
sometime but I think wats are a very
good<00:03:13.600> deck<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:13.990> Slifer<00:03:14.440> um<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:17.620> trying<00:03:17.890> to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
good deck for Slifer um I'm trying to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.460 
good deck for Slifer um I'm trying to
think<00:03:18.040> offhand<00:03:18.370> fraud<00:03:19.300> monarchs<00:03:19.870> might<00:03:20.350> be

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
think offhand fraud monarchs might be

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.520 
think offhand fraud monarchs might be
able<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.950> or<00:03:21.640> frogs<00:03:22.380> anything<00:03:23.380> that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
able to do it or frogs anything that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.710 
able to do it or frogs anything that
generates<00:03:23.709> enough<00:03:24.340> tributes<00:03:24.760> basically

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
generates enough tributes basically

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.420 
generates enough tributes basically
anything<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.320> could<00:03:26.500> run<00:03:26.709> obelisk<00:03:27.280> in

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
anything that you could run obelisk in

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.260 
anything that you could run obelisk in
you<00:03:27.850> can<00:03:28.030> run<00:03:28.180> Slifer<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.370> Slifer<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.550> just

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
you can run Slifer in and Slifer is just

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.660 
you can run Slifer in and Slifer is just
as<00:03:31.450> good<00:03:31.660> if<00:03:31.989> not<00:03:32.110> better<00:03:33.630> than<00:03:34.630> obelisk<00:03:35.170> and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
as good if not better than obelisk and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.620 
as good if not better than obelisk and
one<00:03:36.670> last<00:03:36.910> thing<00:03:37.090> I'm<00:03:37.270> going<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.450> go<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.570> the
