 the amount of people that should be 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 in the collective 92 by the schedule and by 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.580

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.290
 crossing here to the height of flowers 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.780
 which is almost exactly half of the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.250
 travel of this group that goes from 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.440

 We know that the station begins here 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 flowers the influx of public is 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.700
 very many especially during peak hours and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.640
 the recommendations for people to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.250
 that use the other the other steps to 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.380
 donate level alvarez the of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.979
 born because of artigas obviously 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.790
 is absolutely cut pedro by 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.220
 this 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.970
 where two trains of the line 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.110
 branch carried out a collective of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 the line 92 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.610
 we appreciate the contact ariel we are 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.650
 looking at the image what is left you can see the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.750
 different the different stations by 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.549
 which happens on 92 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350
 this is the internal 52 there it looks 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.210
 clearly the number there under the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.330
 name of the body of this 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.100
 collective that today near 6 as 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.600
 our partner said that when trying 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.960
 crossing was hit by a formation 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.080
 of the line sarmiento and this generated the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.940
 later derailment and that's why it's 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.190
 it's so hard to work in the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.920
 place the place that by themselves are two 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.980
 Pedro villas one that goes and another one that comes 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.080
 makes it become a kind of 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.880
 dead end for the staff of 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.350

 the irons twisted to more than 100 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.989
 injured and seven people easy and it's 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.519
 why to perform 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.680
