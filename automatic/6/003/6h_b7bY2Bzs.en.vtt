00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 so i'm 65 2 552 native brain firmware 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.830
 ms-80 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.019
 because the machine Restayl cats no 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.019
 generally they are knocked out by bushes and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:33.370
 here's how the first three cylinders 2 ass from 4 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.450
 5 6 2 for 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.739
 naturally they do not behave very much 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:48.790
 adequately but first absolutely absolutely 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:51.350
 behave Czech by the way until we have 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.330
 because we deleted 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.720
 mistakes and although well then there is a plant or 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:08.300
 institution mistakes littered with the bride 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:08.750
 error may already have there and then 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
 eat by 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:18.320
 re- catalyst until errors in general 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.250
 no , we have a powerful close now show 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.250
 motor about delirium 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.250
 motor you have about the harm 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.930
 volts normal turnover tails contribution yet 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.690
 Well, you can show a smooth adjustment 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.650
 idling again the first lambda on 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.990
 3 cylinders 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.890
 here that is 1 1 call which in 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.040
 the manifold in front of the catalyst for the first 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.850
 three cylinders 1 umbrella in front of the manifold 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.630
 catalyst 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.660
 which time is now empty 3 4 5 6 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.580
 cylinder and smooth adjustment stroke 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.610
 idle are quite adequate exactly 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.540
 works if we so she turns off u 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.590
 Well, we will not show 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 On the contrary, when it turns on, well, that of the 6th 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.870
 us and for example on 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:33.640
 that is, we have it here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.709
 Lanos adaptation camshaft input 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.349
 exit release camshaft release from 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.470
 called for a given value and an actual 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.730
 on 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.340
 on the descent in the corners because it coincides 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.400
 have him us adequately regulated on 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.379
 release vanos and optical set 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.150
 values 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.760
 matches well me a big difference is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.609
 nonsense 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.609
 think about the momentum for example 2000 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.170
 what or the same 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.030
 August see if they are natural 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.460
 right away may not coincide but in general 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.380
 adjustment happens adequately everything 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.380
 ok well, what meet him there 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.720
 saved here but vulva tronic for example our 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.740
 beloved at home better understand how it works 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.070
 but tiempo again makes its own adjustments 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.290
 we have some ridges here and although all 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.870
 value we are replaced but you 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.130
 especially forces at that without manual before a file 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.380
 it does not always work well cheese again 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.130
 tronic look on the couch with you not 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:58.100
 will be able to press well from adaptation choke 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:01.370
 we are going too, everything is fine but it is us 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.470
 they made them 5 that is, such a status 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.380
 as I said in the past video you eat 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.280
 and seppo and 91 to diesel that take out 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.920
 safe for non-understanding people up to f 5 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.160
 inclusive that is with information on 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.450
 block display unit 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:24.770
 read error reading parameter 606 is 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.970
 we already have an activation test that is something 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.530
 power will rise to some tests 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.050
 need to know which run on 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.250
 engine shut down and no one runs 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.340
 on the engine 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.160
 that is, naturally it is necessary to understand and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.020
 don't do that, don't do that 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:49.040
 there is for example we have test 4 by 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:51.080
 the generator is ours is worth 15 3 volts this 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.360
 most likely all return to everyone 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 you can manually set the volts and how much 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.320
 need to check it works correctly 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.000
 generator efficiency adjustment 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.000
 and all the activation of the day 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.120
 that is, that's all for motor now 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.470
 wants to make it 15 you his 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.930
 can do for example light a light 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.140
 They will be seen but now it is 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.370
 small lighting is very say 10 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.510
 8 we will not put this very little 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:26.550
 let's leave 312 here it is the light went out the light 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:32.190
 inflow here 12 now we will return to 15 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:37.110
 volt forcibly we don't really have it on 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.020
 video but the light became brighter i.e. it is 15 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.930
 volt forcibly we don't even have tests 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.139
 then return to f7 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.780
 the engine he asks for more i mean i 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.699
 I think in the car the battery that served either 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.190
 he is about me but not registered because 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.110
 somehow here but this is first on the generator 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.750
 voltage she's not exactly right what 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.600
 generators put up but something like that yes 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.400
 it's not something else in the brains of the box 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.910
 value because they are connected where 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.139
 then elsewhere in the shaft will be the third 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.000
 value but they should be in principle 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.220
 Close to 100 problems there is no Sasha from 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.889
 oxides on wires with oxides on 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.889
 receptions since we returned this whole state 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:22.320
 how to say well to patrol the garden case 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.690
 it drown out start she will return it 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.910
 not remembered then put one 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.410
 svald she will keep one of bye 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:35.300
 motor not to drown or on the card 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:35.300
 version because 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.330
 Well, here are some communication buttons I press 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.000
 again on the scripts 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:48.440
 on scripts and scripts we can 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.540
 Well here we include here a heating cube 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:07:00.040
 there injector our injector yes that is 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:00.040
 see immediately 1 hour wait a second 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.659
 In general, my son finished later 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.659
 to be continued
