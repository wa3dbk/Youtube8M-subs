the net pocket on this is an important
aspect<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> tone<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.980> sound<00:04:20.850> of

the fretboard which this is not uncommon
it<00:04:31.350> has<00:04:31.470> it's<00:04:31.770> not<00:04:31.890> that<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.070> hasn't<00:04:32.220> been<00:04:32.370> done

which look back to this the bottom of
the<00:04:56.010> fretboard<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.610> mean<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.820> 24th<00:04:57.240> fret<00:04:57.420> is

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
the fretboard I mean the 24th fret is

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.650 
the fretboard I mean the 24th fret is
almost<00:04:57.840> right<00:04:58.110> at<00:04:58.440> where<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:59.010> is<00:04:59.820> forms<00:05:00.240> so

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
almost right at where this is forms so

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.990 
almost right at where this is forms so
you<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.470> no<00:05:01.650> keel<00:05:01.950> so<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.340> have<00:05:02.490> all<00:05:02.610> access

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
you have no keel so you have all access

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.440 
you have no keel so you have all access
to<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.600> higher<00:05:03.780> frets<00:05:04.250> which<00:05:05.250> even<00:05:05.910> even<00:05:06.240> job

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
to the higher frets which even even job

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.180 
to the higher frets which even even job
many<00:05:06.780> other<00:05:06.990> people<00:05:07.230> have<00:05:07.350> noticed<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.920> it's

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
many other people have noticed that it's

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.000 
many other people have noticed that it's
it's<00:05:08.730> big<00:05:08.880> advantage<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:10.440> on<00:05:10.680> top<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.950> that

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
it's big advantage and on top of that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.080 
it's big advantage and on top of that
you<00:05:11.460> have<00:05:12.770> brass<00:05:13.770> wood<00:05:14.040> inserts<00:05:14.490> which<00:05:14.850> are

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
bolts which allow you to have a clamping

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
you know take off the neck or you know

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.730 
you know take off the neck or you know
you<00:05:26.700> do<00:05:26.940> normal<00:05:27.330> pairs<00:05:27.570> they<00:05:28.230> eventually<00:05:28.380> pour

you do normal pairs they eventually pour
out<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.160> hole<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.640> start<00:05:29.910> to<00:05:30.000> lose<00:05:30.120> that

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
out the hole but you start to lose that

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.909 
out the hole but you start to lose that
clamping<00:05:30.780> pressure<00:05:30.810> from<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.470> bottom<00:05:31.590> of

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
that clamping pressure is what allows

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.370 
that clamping pressure is what allows
you<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.340> transfer<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.270> vibrations<00:05:39.419> from<00:05:39.930> the

before<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.190> put<00:05:47.430> on<00:05:47.480> put<00:05:48.480> in<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:49.320> rest<00:05:49.950> wood

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
before I put on put in the the rest wood

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.070 
before I put on put in the the rest wood
inserts<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.120> just<00:05:51.300> put<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.570> neck<00:05:51.750> inside

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
inserts and I just put the neck inside

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.380 
inserts and I just put the neck inside
the<00:05:52.169> body<00:05:52.410> and<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:53.160> take<00:05:53.640> it<00:05:53.790> hold<00:05:54.090> it<00:05:54.210> by<00:05:54.360> the

the body and I take it hold it by the
headstock<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.440> tap<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.040> body<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.730> notice

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
headstock and tap the body you notice

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.640 
headstock and tap the body you notice
that<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.180> vibrates<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.630> certain<00:05:57.900> amount<00:05:58.050> as

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
that it vibrates a certain amount as

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.200 
that it vibrates a certain amount as
soon<00:05:58.860> as<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.040> put<00:05:59.190> another<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.880> threaded

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
soon as you put another the threaded

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.270 
soon as you put another the threaded
inserts<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.870> crank<00:06:01.500> those<00:06:01.680> bolts<00:06:02.070> down

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
inserts and crank those bolts down

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.640 
inserts and crank those bolts down
there's<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.180> discernible<00:06:03.750> difference<00:06:04.290> between

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
there's a discernible difference between

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.590 
there's a discernible difference between
how<00:06:04.800> much<00:06:04.980> it<00:06:05.430> vibrates<00:06:05.880> even<00:06:06.330> just<00:06:06.480> by

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
how much it vibrates even just by

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.080 
how much it vibrates even just by
holding<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:07.140> again<00:06:07.500> crank<00:06:08.490> those<00:06:08.669> bolts<00:06:08.970> down

holding it again crank those bolts down

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.180 
holding it again crank those bolts down
