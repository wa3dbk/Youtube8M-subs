00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.940
 what if the shadows would not have prevented 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.830

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.360
 aha he flies up shoot but also 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.130
 respectively iron man by all 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.670
 favorite character who knows how 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.030
 destroy and kill everyone everyone 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.680
 thank you clinic even and some boss 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.160
 let's say burkuta with it would be much 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.230
 harder the game as a form and easy to pass 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.690
 Well, I think that Donata will certainly be here 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.180
 grab now we are just this thing and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.769
 consider so we found some 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:36.350
 items killed a certain amount 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:39.720
 opponents here they are actually zamanuhi 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.680
 zamanuhi these that are any folders from 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.280
 which may fall random some 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.640
 characters so who are we b metrics 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.100
 doctor of the pull us oct opus 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.140
 x3 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.540
 what does it mean guys i'm here honestly not 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.000
 I know what kind of biometrics let's get out 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.140
 missions for the next one opened and pennies 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.850
 here you can discover elite look 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.620
 daily money transfer enough 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.010
 many in each mission will be here too 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.490
 such opponents then battles on the side of 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.900
 the color shop deal is bought at 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.390
 Inventory saw with on here we have our 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.280
 geometry and we click allocation 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.800
 what kind of location i don't even know which one 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.020
 there probably will be a bonus to pass on 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.530
 passing the mission thought so on so here 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.120
 they are the characters themselves 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.470
 this is this fighting 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.910
 then there were some shooting 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.390
 speed that is, who quickly beat 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.270
 fast shoot and versatile here 1 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.750
 strider goal just universal 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:55.220
 a character from good to everyone so to speak 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:59.090
 let's say this and here they are 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.310
 actually pumped so I understand 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.410
 we found a third of the ticket to open 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.050
 here is this guy 3rd need 10 and then 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:12.740
 will open successfully so want to log on 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.230
 arena but they don't let me in because 410 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.650
 need to go through the general messi let's 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.470
 go to these missions to mission 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.990
 drove again spend 4 energy 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.790
 three types of currency in general where games are 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.230
 which are too many types of currency 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:34.280
 I do not like him because they are very 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.370
 zadrotskie so I will say so that's it 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.040
 a lot of donato need a lot of pereprohodit 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:45.140
 missions and generally do any garbage 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.940
 only members moru habits i don't like i 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.950
 be sure to play this game some 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.849
 time enjoy 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.520
 effects 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.720
 the beginning of these battles of epic effects 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.199
 rocks and 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.970
 and spylog characters look a bit 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.810
 personal what is there I think 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.690
 I will pass 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.759

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.669
 swing and generally choose only good 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.650
 games 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.210
