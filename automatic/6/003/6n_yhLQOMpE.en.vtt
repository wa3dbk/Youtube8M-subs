before this then flip this switch to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.550 
before this then flip this switch to
shut<00:02:26.880> down<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.150> force<00:02:27.330> field<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.870> flipped<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
shut down the force field I flipped it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.870 
shut down the force field I flipped it
twice<00:02:28.800> because<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.130> had<00:02:29.220> already<00:02:29.340> gone<00:02:29.580> through

twice because I had already gone through

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.770 
twice because I had already gone through
flipped<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:32.069> through<00:02:32.100> here<00:02:32.780> that's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
flipped it so go through here that's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.180 
flipped it so go through here that's
where<00:02:34.020> our<00:02:34.050> guardian<00:02:34.530> bot<00:02:34.709> will<00:02:34.860> come<00:02:35.010> from

devastating if you don't know that they

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
devastating if you don't know that they
are<00:02:41.069> even<00:02:41.910> though<00:02:42.000> they're<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:42.180> easy<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
are even though they're very easy to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.210 
are even though they're very easy to
take<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.260> single<00:02:43.500> shot<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.069> head

usually<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:44.910> gun<00:02:45.150> I'll<00:02:45.239> take<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.599> out

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
usually with this gun I'll take one out

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.900 
usually with this gun I'll take one out
when<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> go<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.040> these<00:02:47.280> stairs<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.819> then

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
when I go up these stairs and then

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.330 
when I go up these stairs and then
elapse<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:49.410> you're<00:02:49.560> getting<00:02:49.800> close<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.220> with

elapse and you're getting close to with

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.400 
elapse and you're getting close to with
a<00:02:50.400> final<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:50.910> weapons<00:02:51.300> are<00:02:51.480> which<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.200> call<00:02:52.380> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
a final two weapons are which I call a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.949 
a final two weapons are which I call a
business<00:02:52.890> room<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.630> see<00:02:54.810> it's

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
business room and as you can see it's

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.630 
business room and as you can see it's
because<00:02:55.110> there's<00:02:55.290> tons<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.310> tons<00:02:56.519> of

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
because there's tons of is this tons of

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.759
