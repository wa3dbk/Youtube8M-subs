quiz to show you how these buttons work

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.990 
quiz to show you how these buttons work
let's<00:01:01.050> say<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> show<00:01:02.070> our<00:01:02.100> class<00:01:02.550> how

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
let's say we want to show our class how

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
let's say we want to show our class how
to<00:01:03.030> answer<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.750> question<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.500> show

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
to answer the first question and show

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.969 
to answer the first question and show
how<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.489> arrived<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.090> our<00:01:06.270> answer<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.979> let's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
how we arrived at our answer so let's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:19.800 
how we arrived at our answer so let's
pick<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> pen<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> solve<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.510> sum

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.819 

3<00:01:20.810> times<00:01:21.049> 7<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.590> 21<00:01:21.680> carry<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:23.509> 2<00:01:23.719> which<00:01:24.500> takes

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
3 times 7 is 21 carry the 2 which takes

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.240 
3 times 7 is 21 carry the 2 which takes
us<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.159> 91<00:01:25.719> now<00:01:26.719> let's<00:01:27.140> say<00:01:27.409> we<00:01:27.590> wanted<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.009> save

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
us to 91 now let's say we wanted to save

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.800 
us to 91 now let's say we wanted to save
what<00:01:28.520> we've<00:01:28.700> just<00:01:28.729> done<00:01:29.179> into<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.659> word

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
what we've just done into the word

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.340 
what we've just done into the word
document<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.770> use<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.130> as<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> model<00:01:31.579> answer

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
document to use it as a model answer

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.749 
document to use it as a model answer
converting<00:01:33.350> this<00:01:33.500> into<00:01:33.740> text<00:01:34.250> wouldn't<00:01:34.520> work

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
converting this into text wouldn't work

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.609 
converting this into text wouldn't work
because<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.630> numbers<00:01:35.990> would<00:01:36.140> move<00:01:36.350> out<00:01:36.590> of

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
because the numbers would move out of

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.450 
because the numbers would move out of
