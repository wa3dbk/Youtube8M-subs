can they can vary in size depending on

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.770 
can they can vary in size depending on
the<00:02:24.959> time<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.739> year<00:02:26.239> I've<00:02:27.239> seen<00:02:27.540> them<00:02:27.660> grow

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the time of the year I've seen them grow

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.100 
the time of the year I've seen them grow
up<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.260> even<00:02:28.560> five<00:02:28.830> feet<00:02:29.099> tall<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:30.020> what<00:02:31.020> you

up to even five feet tall so what you
want<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.349> look<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.209> leaves<00:02:33.450> are

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
want to look for is that the leaves are

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.950 
want to look for is that the leaves are
in<00:02:33.750> pairs<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.530> their<00:02:34.680> opposite<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.930> you

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
in pairs and that their opposite and you

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.210 
in pairs and that their opposite and you
can<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.770> take<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.370> guy<00:02:38.550> off

I<00:03:58.480> think<00:03:58.630> deal<00:03:58.989> with<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.260> sting<00:03:59.530> is<00:04:00.100> wear

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400

I want to share is my my top reason for

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.020 
I want to share is my my top reason for
why<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.560> think<00:05:35.919> it's<00:05:36.070> important<00:05:36.520> for<00:05:36.580> people<00:05:36.729> to

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
why I think it's important for people to

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.570 
why I think it's important for people to
eat<00:05:37.300> nettles<00:05:37.690> as<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> spring<00:05:38.200> food<00:05:38.440> but<00:05:39.280> in

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
eat nettles as a spring food but in

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.950 
eat nettles as a spring food but in
order<00:05:39.790> to<00:05:39.910> understand<00:05:40.330> that<00:05:40.510> I<00:05:40.570> need<00:05:40.840> to

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
order to understand that I need to

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.090 
order to understand that I need to
explain<00:05:41.260> a<00:05:41.320> little<00:05:41.470> bit<00:05:41.680> about<00:05:41.740> how<00:05:42.070> I

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
explain a little bit about how I

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.890 
explain a little bit about how I
approach<00:05:42.250> plants<00:05:43.060> because<00:05:43.600> I'm<00:05:43.690> not<00:05:43.870> a

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
approach plants because I'm not a

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.980 
approach plants because I'm not a
nutritionist<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:45.060> don't<00:05:46.060> get<00:05:46.240> super<00:05:46.450> excited

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
nutritionist I don't get super excited

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.930 
nutritionist I don't get super excited
about<00:05:47.139> all<00:05:47.350> of<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.650> details<00:05:48.190> when<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.639> comes

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
about all of the details when it comes

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.540 
about all of the details when it comes
to<00:05:49.090> plants<00:05:49.510> but<00:05:50.229> I<00:05:50.289> do<00:05:50.350> get<00:05:50.830> really<00:05:50.860> excited

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
to plants but I do get really excited

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.680 
to plants but I do get really excited
about<00:05:51.880> about<00:05:52.810> meeting<00:05:53.470> new<00:05:54.000> characters<00:05:55.000> let's

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
about about meeting new characters let's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.110 
about about meeting new characters let's
say<00:05:55.930> so<00:05:56.590> I<00:05:56.620> approach<00:05:57.160> plants<00:05:57.550> in<00:05:57.639> this<00:05:57.789> way<00:05:57.970> of

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
say so I approach plants in this way of

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.990 
say so I approach plants in this way of
recognizing<00:05:58.810> them<00:05:58.960> as<00:05:59.169> all<00:05:59.410> having<00:05:59.770> their<00:05:59.889> own

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
recognizing them as all having their own

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 
recognizing them as all having their own
distinct<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:01.180> unique<00:06:01.289> personality<00:06:02.289> they<00:06:02.889> all

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
distinct and unique personality they all

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.100 
distinct and unique personality they all
have<00:06:03.160> their<00:06:03.310> own<00:06:03.340> shape<00:06:03.760> their<00:06:04.389> own<00:06:04.539> way<00:06:05.080> that

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
have their own shape their own way that

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.980 
have their own shape their own way that
they<00:06:05.380> grow<00:06:05.560> where<00:06:06.250> they<00:06:06.280> like<00:06:06.580> to<00:06:06.729> grow<00:06:07.000> they

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
they grow where they like to grow they

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.779 
they grow where they like to grow they
have<00:06:08.020> their<00:06:08.260> own<00:06:08.289> chemistry<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:09.280> what<00:06:09.669> I've

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
have their own chemistry and what I've

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.370 
have their own chemistry and what I've
failed<00:06:10.060> with<00:06:10.330> nettles<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:10.960> what<00:06:11.110> I<00:06:11.139> found

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
failed with nettles and what I found

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.810 
failed with nettles and what I found
with<00:06:11.560> other<00:06:11.710> plants<00:06:12.130> is<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.400> they<00:06:12.520> really

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
with other plants is that they really

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.680 
with other plants is that they really
have<00:06:13.180> this<00:06:14.580> quite<00:06:15.580> surprising<00:06:16.240> to<00:06:16.270> a<00:06:16.419> lot<00:06:16.479> of

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
have this quite surprising to a lot of

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.830 
have this quite surprising to a lot of
people<00:06:16.900> capacity<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:18.280> help<00:06:18.550> help<00:06:19.539> us<00:06:19.630> with

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
people capacity to help help us with

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.080 
people capacity to help help us with
healing<00:06:20.260> our<00:06:20.410> emotional<00:06:20.979> bodies<00:06:21.340> to<00:06:21.729> help<00:06:21.880> us

with healing and our emotional selves

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.300 
with healing and our emotional selves
and<00:06:24.340> then<00:06:24.789> what<00:06:24.940> nettles<00:06:25.300> does<00:06:25.510> is<00:06:25.860> it<00:06:26.860> it

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
and then what nettles does is it it

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.890 
and then what nettles does is it it
helps<00:06:27.639> us<00:06:27.760> to<00:06:27.910> let<00:06:28.060> go<00:06:28.210> of<00:06:28.360> things<00:06:28.510> that<00:06:28.780> we

emotionally<00:06:35.080> we're<00:06:35.320> moving<00:06:35.590> from<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:35.860> season

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
emotionally we're moving from the season

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.060 
emotionally we're moving from the season
of<00:06:36.400> a<00:06:37.470> fear<00:06:38.470> into<00:06:39.280> the<00:06:39.400> season<00:06:39.760> of<00:06:39.849> growth<00:06:40.210> and

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
of a fear into the season of growth and

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.219 
of a fear into the season of growth and
this<00:06:42.070> plant<00:06:42.460> is<00:06:42.729> so<00:06:43.000> important<00:06:43.570> to<00:06:43.780> help<00:06:44.050> with

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
this plant is so important to help with

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.740 
this plant is so important to help with
that<00:06:44.349> transition<00:06:44.849> now<00:06:45.849> medicinally<00:06:46.570> this

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
that transition now medicinally this

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.960 
that transition now medicinally this
plant<00:06:47.050> we<00:06:47.650> can<00:06:47.680> see<00:06:48.039> some<00:06:48.430> of<00:06:48.550> its<00:06:48.700> uses

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
plant we can see some of its uses

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.909 
plant we can see some of its uses
traditionally<00:06:49.870> and<00:06:50.050> how<00:06:50.200> they<00:06:50.440> relate<00:06:50.770> to

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
traditionally and how they relate to

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:52.740 
traditionally and how they relate to
that<00:06:51.130> it's<00:06:51.910> adaptogenic

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
that it's adaptogenic

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.839 
that it's adaptogenic
which<00:06:53.229> means<00:06:53.500> that<00:06:53.740> it<00:06:53.860> supports<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.340> adrenal

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
which means that it supports the adrenal

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.640 
which means that it supports the adrenal
glands<00:06:55.060> it's<00:06:55.660> really<00:06:55.990> effective<00:06:56.380> at<00:06:56.500> helping

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
glands it's really effective at helping

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.339 
glands it's really effective at helping
our<00:06:56.979> body<00:06:57.190> to<00:06:57.669> come<00:06:58.180> down<00:06:58.419> out<00:06:58.630> of<00:06:58.690> a<00:06:58.840> panic<00:06:59.229> and

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
our body to come down out of a panic and
