 com with you heading test hole 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.400
 we decided to highlight this material 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.789
 a separate video is ford material 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.820
 explorer and if you are specific it is him 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.309
 off-road test puddles deep clay 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.160
 rut diagonal hanging snow lay down 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.340
 steep rises and descents Russia is 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.770
 it is accepted to call roads no matter how 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.230
 it was sad to talk about feel like 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 behave comfortably and ford ex mayor we 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.879
 deny yourself this pleasure 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.579
 just could not splash sticky dirt 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.460
 drifts drive is an unforgettable sight 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.399
 want details then proceed but 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.559
 Immediately, I note that this material is decided 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.659
 release separately from the general review and 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.190
 car test test details will be 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.680
 published early next week 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.080
 stay tuned and subscribe to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
 our channel if you have not made a new one 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 ford explorer unlike past 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.700
 generations have we become more comfortable order 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.040
 more technological 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.810
 engineers managed to keep off-road 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.270
 potential and combine it with 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.100
 safety and comfort cut or 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.730
 on it is mud real ford owners 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.070
 explorer 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.770
 this is a big question but have a margin 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.890
 cross does not hurt even on ordinary 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 the roads 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.120
 of course for serious off-road 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.220
 travel car refinement is required 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.570
 explorer is no exception here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.480
 no manual lock 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.680
 not special rubber not winch and not 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.740
 power bumper 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.510
 but we're driving the American legend on 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 this ford explore 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.070
 but some kind of this model is not well on the past 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.770
 farmers and cowboys conquered texas that is 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.740
 where there are no roads at all we have a kersey plan 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.960
 was us completely against we on the test 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.060
 build ford explorer limited 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.400
 sport version is also available now 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.140
 Russia, our car was going to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.910
 Elabuga 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.070
 he has especially unlike 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.500
 obverse who came first about everything 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.970
 it was a hand now available by the way version 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.740
 sport to i was talking she is different 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.040
 the presence of a turbine and more power 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.200
 aul mika 204 horses in sport 360 and 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.110
 there is a gasoline hiding under our hood 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.340
 2 6 cyclone cyclone engine more precisely 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.080
 engine smolin torque 346 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.940
 despite more than 2 tons of weight 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.480
 the car responds well to the pedal 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.730
 gas 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.340
 but it is worth considering that the pedal to the floor 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.320
 markedly empties gasoline in the tank on 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.610
 acceleration to 100 kilometers per hour go 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.610
 just under 10 seconds 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.920
 but the higher the speed the less cutting 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.930
 becomes the engine there is some 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.120
 thoughtfulness and aviary here is worth 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.750
 add smooth switching 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.360
 6-speed gearbox 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.610
 comfort is a nice addition 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.570
 inside the car and you just want 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.880
 enjoy dear 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.440
 rather than engage in races or races 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.320
 conclusively with the fact that you are cool 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.740
 driver despite bad road 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.810
 conditions 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.910
 native insulation copes with 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.130
 his task is excellent sometimes 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.130
 you forget that you are not driving on asphalt 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.780
 on the dirt road for example surprisingly 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.880
 ford explorer behaves well in 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.670
 turn massive body roll no 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.490
 to take him by the nose is problematic 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.300
 but you need to be neat drama time or 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.400
 slip or 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.220
 overconfidence may cost 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.110
 expensive car lost frame but 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.850
 it's difficult to call it a crossover 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.459
 and part of this is due to the large 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.810
 dimensions and important views of the present 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.570
 off road is not for him 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.090
 but curbs dirt road deep 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.340
 puddles are not cleared of snow the road he 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 ford explorer overcomes 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.200
 which we test is going in and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.060
 paws as adaptation for Russia he 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.580
 lost the plastic skirt on the front 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.680
 the bumper is by the way good on often 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.160
 breaks down in the winter and as far as i read on 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.980
 forums 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.990
 owners just more often shoot those first 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.720
 buyers of this car also 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.440
 it turned out we added that protection 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.440
 engine radiator 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.830
 but 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.680
 this 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.389
 It controls the drive system is here 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.159
 terrain management 4 water assist 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.930
 driver washers available at hand with 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.889
 switching modes this potassium dirt 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.830
 snow grass 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.779
 sand and trails there is no direct blocking 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.939
 lower differentials here either 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:37.550
 everything is under the power of electronics 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.919
 ford explorer feels free to 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.930
 broken asphalt and chest folded 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.680
 the feeling that it is for such roads un 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.229
 and was created 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.289
 here plays a role a positive role 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.060
 long stroke suspension 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.490
 most pits and potholes are just 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.110
 Swallowed suspension is quite comfortable 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.569
 sell country road at high speed 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.089
 especially not notice what happens in it 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.680
 time under the wheels work ford engineers 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.839
 can be called successful managed to achieve 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.300
 exactly what you expect the car this 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.759
 again assets and body type 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.169
 rejection of brutality actually 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.860
 expect now owners of SUVs 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.180
 most often you need an image and ponty and this 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.550
 traceable to all modern 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.310
 ford explorer model 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.129
 did not become an exception and that is absolutely 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.779

 car its interior all technology 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.460
 which are developed here quite 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.569
 interesting cars and pretty try 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.789
 make an interesting test 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.039
