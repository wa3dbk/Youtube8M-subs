00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.150
 I'm sorry I flew so far to here 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.600
 Ijiri by chance 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.730
 android official 3.1 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:25.190
 The icon is a 500 tablet from now 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.890
 I'm going to root 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.020
 Now already 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:37.790
 let alone contains pieces of root of the app 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.790
 I 'm going to get an envelope strout 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.580
 I'll try 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.350
 I knew 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.760
 After all, ac adapters are attached. 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.910
 Super user 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.910
 I'm asking if it 's okay, so I'm of course already strengthening 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.770
 Strengthen 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.540
 I do n't like it 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.540
 This still what had 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.980
 Is it more ? 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.300
 Is it that it was over because of anxiety ? 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.479
 Soft super user 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.479
 It is a story that the icon is out 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.620
 Anywhere 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 It is written that it is said that it is started 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.450
 So why not let's start forced age by yourself 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.590
 I 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.270
 It is at that time and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.630
 It was written because it started west 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.530
 As far as we see now 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:34.230
 Manually, so that was not the west Kido 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.230
 I tried sat down but how about it 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.680
 Phase unchanged 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.330
 It is Mitan but Saiki 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:55.060
 It is late for the company which is 0 start of maa . 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 For example, basically an android terminal is said to shut down 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.330
 Because there is little 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.590
 And Well wonder if this is not ginger 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.410
 is 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.410
 No wonder what's wrong with your voice 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.519
 Super user 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.210
 Yes there is nowhere now, so I wonder if it's a failure 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.010
 Well 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:31.870
 It is the result that I searched for variously 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:34.900
 &amp; After tapping the root apk file and pressing the root button is ok 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:40.650
 If it is the web something genius 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:44.690
 I've been a brilliant Hall automatically but was re-started manually because did not 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.410
 If you thought you were not in the text screen 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.860
 When looking through the eight pre 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.090
 There is a par user to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.090
 To this 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:03.269
 aiko and a 500's 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.269
 Rooting of android 3.1 succeeded
