 Diana I want to tell you that really 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.800
 I admire that you are good chan with a 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.740
 because you have had galas in which of 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.240
 suddenly I have not been very good in yoga 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.310
 the wonderful ones where we've done that 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.099
 has been the best presentation of the 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.069
 night and today I found this presentation 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:26.129
 very well I also congratulate you because it 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.110
 note when you work and this character does not 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:32.340
 there's nothing easy this character chose a 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.960
 character very studied very complex and 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.030
 today we have not done anything wrong there is 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.949
 be careful with the treble with the 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.620
 breathing the moment you dance 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:42.360
 and that the movements and the choreography 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.150
 that you have to do not distract what 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.909
 that you have vocally built what is 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.240
 what has happened I do not know what is super 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.509
 hard 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.220
 I know but you have to try, I know that 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.400
 you place desire that you are what you are going to 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.180
 achieve 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.300
 to jokes that lie down of jury 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.850
 diana yo yes we if this program 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.350
 give a prize to the biggest growth you 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.350
 you would be a series of opponents 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.340
 unfortunately, there is not us 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.930
 we choose 8 imitators that we consider 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.789
 the best and the public with them 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.500
 it's a favorite however I have to 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:23.710
 praise the growth because I think 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.500
 remarkable I think there's still work 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.199
 what to do in your technique in the 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.729
 resonators in the support I think there would be 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.610
 it was better that your fall was between 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.440
 phrases so I would not interrupt 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.259
 your song I think there's still 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.539
 work more the letter the English and the 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:42.759
 air so there are no detours without 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:44.620
 But currently they are very good and 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:47.889
 vocally it has grown a lot 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.750
 fernando and tone more has a lot 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.930
 talent and to make this character 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.550
 a lot but a lot of attitude 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.680
 excellent comments to take a seat 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.110
 please 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.849
 excuse me 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.080
 Thank you 

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:04.080
