00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 and to the bang tour agency and will also participate in our project complain about 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.650
 a whole world, ten Brazilian agencies will create commercials like 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.200
 global warming who talks to us now why does the person 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.100
 director of creation of the agency and talks about the importance of participating in the project 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.930
 the project claims for a better world is an interesting project that is the 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.750
 coffee participates with certainty 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.000
 and I think it's time for us to really discuss 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.379
 global warming 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.879
 and all the things that are happening with nature and with our ecosystem 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.040
 is our planet earth 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.010
 I think we have to really 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.060
 what do you want account for? 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.860
 Seriously, what I want is serious about the attitudes we have to take 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.510
 what are the real measures that we have to take I think a lot 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.920
 it has been said and little has been done but the beginning by planting a tree what 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.120
 people are going to make a better world I think then I think it starts arguing 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.750
 really everything that involves global warming everything that involves 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.100
 and I think our play will try 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.820
 in a bad way as much as different poking at it really knows 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 did not stop for another 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.220
 plant a tree 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.250
 to nightclub your car that spend a lot of gasoline in the garage 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 I think we really have to have an ecological conscience in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.510
 We all do a lot of what we do and I think sometimes people end up 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.179
 worrying a lot about the ex makro worrying very little about the monkey 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.109
 with which each one can make his life 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.449
 so I think our play will try to tinker with it
