00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.470
 We recently had a review 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 representative of the class of modern 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.110
 samsung smart tv TVs 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.120
 codename ue 46 f 6510 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 This device differs quite good 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.350
 price tag well, as is often the case 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.970
 all have to pay we decided 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 figure out what will donate 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.930
 user who decides to save with 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.560
 you alexey tereshchenko and project 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.689
 ferumm.com 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 and now I will tell you about 5 reasons for 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.150
 which is not worth buying this 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.059
 television 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 let's start with the appearance despite 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.050
 extraordinary design manufacturer 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360
 made some mistakes 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 I have a claim the first of them 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 is the location of all interfaces 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 to connect on the back of that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
 implies the impossibility of switching 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 TV in case it is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 hung on the wall despite this 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.969
 problem can be solved by connecting all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 required devices before installation on 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.469
 bracket but agree to shoot 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.350
 TV for audio system connection 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.879
 or player is not the best entertainment 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.250
 acoustics for most users 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.430
 is an important factor about their 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.560
 6510 it represents only two 10 wadded 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.720
 dynamics what is the second reason 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 think about buying another model on 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.400
 manufacturer's website in the sound section you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 find a list of technologies used 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.650
 to improve the sound and reassurance 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.939
 volume sound but judge for yourself 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.640
 realize it all with quality 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.890
 the presence of two speakers is impossible sound 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 practically devoid of volume and we are missing 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 depths give maximum volume could 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 would be much higher but the man 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.409
 who cares about acoustic 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.450
 component of the TV will connect to it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.460
 external audio system they 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.950
 demanding user will be enough 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 embedded speakers 3 reasons to opt out 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.060
 from the purchase I would call the absence 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.220
 built-in webcam when possible 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 connect more samsung 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.010
 offers an optional camera but her 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.230
 the price of $ 100 is not 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.820
 call sane since this amount 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.330
 makes up a tenth of the cost 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.250
 TV itself 4 reason not to buy 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.310
 it was not clear and constructive solution 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.410
 namely, the location of the indicator diode 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.390
 responsible for power in transparent 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.520
 plastic prism working like 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 magnifying lens as a result 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.030
 annoying red glow when 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.100
 turned on all tv 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.720
 if when viewed during daylight or 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.060
 even in complete darkness you are unlikely 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.700
 pay attention to it at night she 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.680
 exactly prevent your peaceful sleep and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.570
 the last and the reason was 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.730
 traditional mess with the price 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.500
 samsung policy at a price of a thousand 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.690
 dollars our hero can offer 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.300
 exactly the same set of functions as 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.370
 similar tv example 3g or 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.890
 philips true last offer 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.710
 such functionality with price tags 150 200 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.320
 dollars cheaper we learned 5 reasons for 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.030
 which should not buy samsung ue 46 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.280
 f 6510 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.740

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.900
