00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
a tad let's compile and then say a lot

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.550 
a tad let's compile and then say a lot
of<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.480> problems<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> management

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560

with the board stuff like that but he

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.850 
with the board stuff like that but he
must<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.750> least<00:02:33.780> somewhat<00:02:34.380> decent<00:02:34.590> if

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
must be at least somewhat decent if

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.680 
must be at least somewhat decent if
Chelsea<00:02:35.100> picking<00:02:35.489> him<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.090> he's<00:02:36.239> around<00:02:36.510> a

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
69 rating on head to head at the moment

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.940 
69 rating on head to head at the moment
so<00:02:39.420> could<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.959> an<00:02:40.050> interest<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.709> silver

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so could be an interest in little silver
