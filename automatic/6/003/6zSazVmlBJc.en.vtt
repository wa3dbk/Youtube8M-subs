pine riser that had failed from from the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.380 
pine riser that had failed from from the
one-inch<00:00:48.120> pipe<00:00:48.329> bo<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:51.300> reworked<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
one-inch pipe bo and I I reworked it

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.549 
one-inch pipe bo and I I reworked it
since<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.510> didn't<00:00:54.809> need<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> full<00:00:58.260> length

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
since I didn't need the the full length

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
since I didn't need the the full length
of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.160> ends<00:00:59.489> were<00:00:59.750> where<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> presidentís

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of the ends were where the presidentís

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.479 
of the ends were where the presidentís
had<00:01:02.039> pulled<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.379> just<00:01:04.379> worked<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
had pulled out I just I just worked the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.890 
had pulled out I just I just worked the
wood<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:07.140> where<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> could<00:01:08.600> fit<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> into

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
wood down to where I could fit it into

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.480 
wood down to where I could fit it into
the<00:01:10.200> 3/4<00:01:10.740> inch<00:01:10.770> pipe<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.250> just

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the 3/4 inch pipe and this just is just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.359 
the 3/4 inch pipe and this just is just
basically<00:01:15.170> an<00:01:16.170> experiment<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
basically an experiment see if this is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
basically an experiment see if this is
going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> work<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.229> looks<00:01:19.439> like

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to work in it and it looks like

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.270 
going to work in it and it looks like
it's<00:01:19.740> gone<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:22.189> started<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> 23<00:01:24.210> inch

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's gone I started out with a 23 inch

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.870 
it's gone I started out with a 23 inch
pipe<00:01:26.299> two<00:01:27.299> piece<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> 23<00:01:28.229> inch<00:01:28.290> pipe<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
pipe two piece of the 23 inch pipe the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.219 
pipe two piece of the 23 inch pipe the
riser<00:01:33.320> was<00:01:34.909> let's<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:37.130> 13<00:01:38.130> inches<00:01:38.490> including

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
riser was let's see 13 inches including

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.429 
riser was let's see 13 inches including
me<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.520> 2<00:01:41.729> inches<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.329> inserted<00:01:43.079> into<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
me the 2 inches that's inserted into the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.020 
me the 2 inches that's inserted into the
pipe<00:01:43.680> line<00:01:43.890> each<00:01:44.009> end<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.729> nine

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
pipe line each end so it's about nine

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.249 
pipe line each end so it's about nine
inches<00:01:45.450> showing<00:01:47.240> after<00:01:48.240> heating<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> limbs

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
inches showing after heating the limbs

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
inches showing after heating the limbs
ended<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:50.149> 2020<00:01:52.009> -<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.189> 20

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
ended up 2020 - a 20

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
ended up 2020 - a 20
I'm<00:01:54.210> sorry<00:01:54.540> -<00:01:54.630> 23<00:01:55.140> inches<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> started<00:01:56.040> with

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
I'm sorry - 23 inches now I started with

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.859 
I'm sorry - 23 inches now I started with
24<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.799> 23<00:01:59.399> 23<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.719> 9<00:02:02.509> from<00:02:03.509> string<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
24 so the 23 23 and 9 from string to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
string nock is right at 50 inches

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.990 
string nock is right at 50 inches
and<00:02:09.450> I've<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.670> five<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.939> half

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and I've got about a five and a half

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.940 
and I've got about a five and a half
inch<00:02:12.329> brace<00:02:12.989> hiding<00:02:13.349> right<00:02:13.469> here<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.950> haven't

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
inch brace hiding right here I haven't

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.929 
inch brace hiding right here I haven't
shot<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.849> yet<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.060> haven't<00:02:19.250> measured<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.609> draw

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
shot it yet I haven't measured the draw

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.119 
shot it yet I haven't measured the draw
weight<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> suspect<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.260> around<00:02:22.469> 35<00:02:23.099> to

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
weight but I suspect it's around 35 to

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.990 
weight but I suspect it's around 35 to
40<00:02:23.640> s<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.939> fansign<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.500> I'll<00:02:28.890> I'll<00:02:29.609> play<00:02:29.849> with

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
40 s or a fansign so I'll I'll play with

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.610 
40 s or a fansign so I'll I'll play with
this<00:02:30.180> tomorrow<00:02:30.540> shoot<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.079> time<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.500> I'll<00:02:31.590> let

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
