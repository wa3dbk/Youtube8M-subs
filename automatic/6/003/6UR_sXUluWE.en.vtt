00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.400
 hi everyone I'm jaime 14 we're 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.700
 here in a new video for the former 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.160
 2014 we are in an online career and 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.980
 Once again they have put us to the fucking bull 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.689
 rosso I do not know why encasquetan 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.460
 because he does not have the man fights that 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.890
 the grand prize of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 germany and well then nothing 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.869
 I wanted to make a career totally 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 fast right now a long time or 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 What I wanted to do was get into 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.309
 the online without looking at anything to look for 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.989
 heading find whatever and now and 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.780
 hope not to screw up, because of course 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.489
 before Easter, we had the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 formula 1 so we're going to see the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.410
 career shit that comes clear to us 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 because yes it is true that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.110
 It is almost nearly two weeks without playing 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 formula 1 that I'm stretching the bonus 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 then on Wednesday I post after two 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.350
 weeks without touching this game miner 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.629
 this name 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.910
 to now make a career look 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.189
 similar if it's going to be bullshit I do not know 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.390
 will choose in a good race to leave 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.920
 to other previous videos that you have 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.690
 done better or just go to 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 another channel that is also a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 good chance let's see 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.950
 06 10 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.899
 at the exit of lame 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.899
 the crap is going to be good 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.710
 I left with the exit of shit in 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.030
 this online game I do not know why being 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.030
 fatal but I do not know 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.040
 the outputs are very very shit 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.790
 clear is in the end what gives 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.790
 the connection wins 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.640
 it will not be possible to cut back in that time 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.050
 why 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.229
 if I had a little bit of practice or 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.630
 leave but that stamps and I'm in 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.110
 conditions of trimming similar 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 distance 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.230
 good here the way they encounter 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.230
 support from not understand 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.340
 they seemed clean of everything 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.740
 I believe that it is already 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.300
 but like the yin and this one 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.580
 with this doing Australian uncle 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.370
 what to do with your life shot by the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.510
 victory to anyone who does not because the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.510
 austral was a taboo 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.920
 australia no uncle 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.800
 the first one finds that the truth 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.440
 gives half a half means computes 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.480
 half provokes 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.019
 almost carefully 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.490
 fucking jimmy that the video of about 10 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.790
 degrees 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.240
 relax because I come with intention to 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.600
 play relaxed and without putting wafers to the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.600
 egg 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.430
 if he gives me back if I go ahead and 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.010
 he gives it back 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.010
 so now the video but it remains strong 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.530
 and fernando before not to give him I'm a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.530
 uncle uncle 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.980
 because of the theme what is done with your 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.980
 life because the ejido is worth more and why 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.940
 the novelty because basically not having 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.180
 enough space well so 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.799
 getting out 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:25.599
 and at the beginning because 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.599
 the first to his ball 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.289
 I would have liked to speak with the first 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.279
 that has rhythm 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.279
 and hear their 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.180
 what it has is that the waves are very 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.949
 short 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.460
 and waste time with a little battle and 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.460
 goodbye 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.480
 it's three laps and five 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.430
 it would be even more boring because they would be 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.730
 two more laps doing nothing but at 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.730
 less 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.170
 we were like doors waiting with a 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.170
 shot a nutty by the way 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.430
 second sector memory highlights what 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.430
 previous 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.300
 good 117 for all missed 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.860
 a little bit to take the turn 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.360
 fast what is obvious what is more than 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.090
 obvious is that I could have given 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.840
 battle which is a shame because 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.840
 I would like 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.809
 because on the retired this 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.909
 well also short videos but good 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.069
 that's how you are, you do not know just to 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.240
 distract a bit and nothing I hope everything 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.810
 the video and we'll see each other in the next 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.810
 example
