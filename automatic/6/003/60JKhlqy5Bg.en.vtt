00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
going to bring in very interesting

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
going to bring in very interesting
results<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.550> say<00:02:08.759> at<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.970> point

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
results is what we can say at this point

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.190 
results is what we can say at this point
of<00:02:09.420> time

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
of time

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.589 
of time
and<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.849> reach<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.360> Mars

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
and do you think you will reach the Mars

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.420 
and do you think you will reach the Mars
orbit<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.680> very<00:02:13.860> tough<00:02:14.160> call

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430

from here from Earth to Mars no we have

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.759 
from here from Earth to Mars no we have
absolutely<00:02:17.730> no<00:02:17.879> doubt<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.410> reaching<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> Mars

about that now there is there is a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.949 
about that now there is there is a
discussion<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.430> comet<00:02:33.060> may<00:02:33.090> hit<00:02:33.510> Mars

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
around the same time is that gonna be

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.839 
around the same time is that gonna be
something<00:02:37.830> which<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.220> looking<00:02:38.549> forward

to<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.290> something<00:02:40.560> which<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:40.920> are

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
to or it is something which you are

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.039 
to or it is something which you are
afraid<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> may<00:02:42.269> come<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
afraid of that it may come in the way of

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.620 
afraid of that it may come in the way of
Mongolian<00:02:43.920> mission<00:02:44.220> see<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.239> we<00:02:45.540> are

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
Mongolian mission see what we are

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.390 
Mongolian mission see what we are
expecting<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.620> course<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.010> there<00:02:47.310> is

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
expecting is of course this there is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.460 
expecting is of course this there is
still<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> lot<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.849> fun<00:02:48.269> certainty<00:02:48.989> about<00:02:49.260> what

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
still a lot of fun certainty about what

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.100 
still a lot of fun certainty about what
exactly<00:02:49.890> will<00:02:50.250> happen<00:02:50.430> where<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.540> comet

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
exactly will happen where that comet

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.559 
exactly will happen where that comet
will<00:02:52.319> come<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.890> how<00:02:53.340> much<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.760> for<00:02:54.060> Mars<00:02:54.329> it

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
will come and how much of for Mars it

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.530 
will come and how much of for Mars it
will<00:02:54.750> be<00:02:54.870> able<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.380> actually<00:02:56.150> engulf<00:02:57.150> during

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
will be able to actually engulf during

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.539 
will be able to actually engulf during
the<00:02:57.690> thing<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.650> are<00:02:58.680> looking<00:02:59.069> at<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.370> also

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
the thing but we are looking at it also

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.610 
the thing but we are looking at it also
as<00:02:59.790> an<00:02:59.940> opportunity<00:03:00.630> because<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.110> gives<00:03:01.349> us<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
as an opportunity because it gives us a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.490 
as an opportunity because it gives us a
unique<00:03:01.910> set<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:02.940> observation<00:03:03.840> capability

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
unique set of observation capability

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.589 
unique set of observation capability
very<00:03:04.709> close<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> comet<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
very close to a comet and this is a

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.690 
very close to a comet and this is a
unique<00:03:06.840> opportunity<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.739> would<00:03:07.860> say<00:03:08.130> because

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
unique opportunity we would say because

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.940 
unique opportunity we would say because
like<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.390> any<00:03:09.569> other<00:03:09.750> case<00:03:10.110> we<00:03:10.440> are<00:03:10.560> trying<00:03:10.829> to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
like in any other case we are trying to

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.339 
like in any other case we are trying to
look<00:03:11.130> at<00:03:11.310> opportunities<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> situations

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
look at opportunities in the situations

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.890 
look at opportunities in the situations
that<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.680> encounter<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.239> comet<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.810> going

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
that we encounter so the comet is going

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.170 
that we encounter so the comet is going
to<00:03:16.139> be<00:03:16.230> an<00:03:16.319> opportunity<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.310> don't<00:03:17.790> think<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
to be an opportunity you don't think it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.819 
to be an opportunity you don't think it
will<00:03:18.269> come<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> way<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:19.019> our<00:03:19.170> instruments

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
will come in the way of our instruments

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.800 
will come in the way of our instruments
functioning<00:03:20.340> no<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.030> won't<00:03:21.209> come<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> way

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
functioning no it won't come in the way

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.809 
functioning no it won't come in the way
of<00:03:21.930> instruments<00:03:22.500> functioning<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.579> course

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
of instruments functioning but of course

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.789 
of instruments functioning but of course
we<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.269> go<00:03:24.420> through<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.870> details<00:03:25.470> of

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
we have to go through the details of

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.370 
we have to go through the details of
between<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.750> time<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.200> reach<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
between now and the time we reach the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.890 
between now and the time we reach the
Mars<00:03:28.829> we<00:03:29.400> need<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.760> understand<00:03:30.269> more<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.690> more

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
Mars we need to understand more and more

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.750 
Mars we need to understand more and more
about<00:03:31.139> this<00:03:31.350> comet<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.489> not<00:03:32.609> very

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
about this comet but we are not very

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.629 
about this comet but we are not very

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
one of the key lessons would be the kind

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.490 
one of the key lessons would be the kind
of<00:03:50.299> testing<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.630> do<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.139> payload

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
of testing that you do on the payload

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.680 
of testing that you do on the payload
itself<00:03:52.709> what<00:03:53.130> kind<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.549> environmental<00:03:54.180> tests

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
itself what kind of environmental tests

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.500 
itself what kind of environmental tests
you<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:56.160> terms<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.790> actually

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
you do and in terms of actually

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.740 
you do and in terms of actually
evaluating<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.470> performance<00:03:58.940> we<00:03:59.940> have<00:03:59.970> taken

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
evaluating the performance we have taken

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.110 
evaluating the performance we have taken
some<00:04:00.989> lessons<00:04:01.530> from<00:04:01.680> Chandra<00:04:02.069> Han<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.459> also

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
some lessons from Chandra Han and also

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.559 
some lessons from Chandra Han and also
in<00:04:03.269> terms<00:04:03.389> of<00:04:03.780> many<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.880> time

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
in terms of many of the as the time

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.479 
in terms of many of the as the time
available<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.410> realizing<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.099> hard<00:04:08.280> very

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
available for realizing the hard very

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.819 
available for realizing the hard very
small<00:04:08.910> many<00:04:09.510> times<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:10.019> we<00:04:10.230> need<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:10.709> is

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
small many times what we need to do is

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.800 
small many times what we need to do is
we<00:04:11.010> need<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.370> use<00:04:11.569> commercial<00:04:12.569> off-the-shelf

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
we need to use commercial off-the-shelf

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.379 
we need to use commercial off-the-shelf
components<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.430> what<00:04:14.669> we<00:04:14.819> have<00:04:14.970> done<00:04:15.150> this

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
components but what we have done this

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.300 
components but what we have done this
time<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.840> all<00:04:16.079> those<00:04:16.289> components<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.220> been

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
time is all those components have been

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.089 
time is all those components have been
put<00:04:17.639> through<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.970> rigorous<00:04:18.200> set<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.470> testing

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
put through a rigorous set of testing

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.879 
put through a rigorous set of testing
regime<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.479> are

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
regime so that we are

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.920 
regime so that we are
convinced<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:22.729> these<00:04:22.909> components<00:04:23.659> are<00:04:23.780> not

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
convinced that these components are not

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.290 
convinced that these components are not
going<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.349> get<00:04:24.499> into<00:04:24.830> any<00:04:24.949> problem<00:04:25.490> during<00:04:26.030> the

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
going to get into any problem during the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.270 
going to get into any problem during the
mission<00:04:26.659> this<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.199> one<00:04:27.469> of<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> key<00:04:27.860> lessons

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
mission this is one of the key lessons

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.279 
mission this is one of the key lessons
we<00:04:28.430> have<00:04:28.460> learned<00:04:28.580> from<00:04:28.939> Chandra<00:04:29.360> Han<00:04:29.539> so<00:04:29.990> star

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
we have learned from Chandra Han so star

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.100 
we have learned from Chandra Han so star
sensors<00:04:30.740> will<00:04:30.919> perform<00:04:31.310> yeah<00:04:32.150> we<00:04:32.389> have<00:04:32.599> one<00:04:32.960> of

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
sensors will perform yeah we have one of

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.959 
sensors will perform yeah we have one of
the<00:04:33.199> things<00:04:33.469> is<00:04:33.620> we<00:04:33.770> have<00:04:33.889> also<00:04:34.069> put<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.550> star

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
the things is we have also put a star

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.760 
the things is we have also put a star
sensor<00:04:35.449> which<00:04:35.659> is<00:04:35.689> from<00:04:36.379> which<00:04:36.590> we<00:04:36.740> are

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
sensor which is from which we are

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.909 
sensor which is from which we are
importing<00:04:37.370> from<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:38.479> Soudan<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:39.620> there<00:04:39.830> is

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
importing from the Soudan so there is

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.279 
importing from the Soudan so there is
one<00:04:40.129> technology<00:04:40.879> different<00:04:41.599> also<00:04:41.810> different

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
one technology different also different

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.290 
one technology different also different
also<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.860> there<00:04:43.099> one<00:04:43.550> of<00:04:43.699> it<00:04:43.909> is<00:04:44.060> our<00:04:44.210> own

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
also is there one of it is our own

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.540 
also is there one of it is our own
another<00:04:44.779> one<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.169> from<00:04:45.319> a<00:04:45.650> different<00:04:46.039> source

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
another one is from a different source

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.629 
another one is from a different source
so<00:04:47.150> in<00:04:47.270> terms<00:04:47.539> of<00:04:48.009> technology<00:04:49.009> differences

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
so in terms of technology differences

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.420 
so in terms of technology differences
also<00:04:49.879> we<00:04:50.240> are<00:04:50.330> taking<00:04:50.659> care<00:04:50.870> are<00:04:51.349> they<00:04:51.650> extra

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
also we are taking care are they extra

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.670 
also we are taking care are they extra
redundancies<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.479> have<00:04:53.659> made<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:54.439> your

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
redundancies you have made in your

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.950 
redundancies you have made in your
hardware<00:04:55.120> compared<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.300> what<00:04:56.449> was<00:04:56.599> flown<00:04:56.930> in

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
hardware compared to what was flown in

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.950 
hardware compared to what was flown in
general<00:04:57.439> in<00:04:58.370> terms<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.789> spacecraft<00:04:59.150> tests<00:04:59.840> we

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
general in terms of spacecraft tests we

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.809 
general in terms of spacecraft tests we
have<00:05:00.080> done<00:05:00.289> many<00:05:00.469> things<00:05:00.620> in<00:05:01.159> terms<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.639> the

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
have done many things in terms of the

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.209 
have done many things in terms of the
the<00:05:02.569> bus<00:05:02.810> management<00:05:03.469> unit<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.069> the

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
the bus management unit and the

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.070 
the bus management unit and the
decoupling<00:05:04.849> between<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.479> telemetry<00:05:05.870> and

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
decoupling between the telemetry and

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.439 
decoupling between the telemetry and
telecom<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.830> many<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.849> things<00:05:08.029> we<00:05:08.300> have

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
telecom and many of the things we have

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.499 
telecom and many of the things we have
taken<00:05:09.199> special<00:05:09.529> precautions<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.580> we<00:05:11.360> have

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
taken special precautions and we have

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.189 
taken special precautions and we have
got<00:05:11.719> more<00:05:12.909> paths<00:05:13.909> through<00:05:14.599> which<00:05:14.629> we<00:05:15.020> can

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
got more paths through which we can

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.649 
got more paths through which we can
operate<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.830> then<00:05:16.279> get<00:05:16.699> out<00:05:16.879> of<00:05:17.089> in<00:05:17.389> case<00:05:17.599> of

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
operate and then get out of in case of

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.899 
operate and then get out of in case of
any<00:05:17.960> difficulties<00:05:18.650> but<00:05:19.189> that<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.580> one<00:05:19.729> of<00:05:19.849> the

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
any difficulties but that is one of the

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.450 
any difficulties but that is one of the
key<00:05:20.089> lessons<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.719> then<00:05:21.289> apart<00:05:21.680> from<00:05:21.800> that<00:05:22.219> the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
key lessons and then apart from that the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.610 
key lessons and then apart from that the
spacecraft<00:05:22.789> itself<00:05:23.300> because<00:05:24.139> we<00:05:24.379> have<00:05:24.499> to

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
spacecraft itself because we have to

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.159 
spacecraft itself because we have to
operate<00:05:25.009> it<00:05:25.249> for<00:05:25.909> a<00:05:25.969> long<00:05:26.270> time<00:05:26.659> without

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
operate it for a long time without

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.860 
operate it for a long time without
visibility<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.639> there<00:05:28.819> is<00:05:28.909> a<00:05:28.939> great<00:05:29.389> amount<00:05:29.689> of

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
visibility so there is a great amount of

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.990 
visibility so there is a great amount of
autonomy<00:05:30.229> built<00:05:30.800> into<00:05:31.129> this<00:05:31.250> satellite<00:05:31.759> and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
autonomy built into this satellite and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.149 
autonomy built into this satellite and
is<00:05:32.479> also<00:05:32.839> one<00:05:33.020> of<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.259> new<00:05:33.439> things<00:05:33.740> and<00:05:33.949> all

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
is also one of the new things and all

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.469 
is also one of the new things and all
these<00:05:34.339> aspects<00:05:34.879> have<00:05:35.089> been<00:05:35.270> thoroughly

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
these aspects have been thoroughly

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.540 
these aspects have been thoroughly
tested<00:05:35.719> during<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:36.919> course<00:05:37.159> of<00:05:37.370> our

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
tested during the course of our

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.480 
tested during the course of our
spacecraft<00:05:38.360> level<00:05:38.899> testing<00:05:39.379> what<00:05:40.099> happens

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
spacecraft level testing what happens

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.450
