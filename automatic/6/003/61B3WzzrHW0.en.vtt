00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
familiar with most of these players

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340

having<00:00:48.420> virtually<00:00:48.750> new<00:00:48.870> information<00:00:49.289> on

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
having virtually new information on

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
having virtually new information on
their<00:00:49.530> place<00:00:49.739> style<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.640> makes<00:00:50.820> us<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
their place style and that makes us a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.119 
their place style and that makes us a
hard<00:00:51.180> bed<00:00:51.449> arrow<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> other<00:00:52.770> hand<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
hard bed arrow on the other hand is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.709 
hard bed arrow on the other hand is
still<00:00:53.309> sort<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> shaky<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> last<00:00:54.390> bus<00:00:54.570> 23

against<00:00:55.500> invasion<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.340> sub<00:00:56.550> went

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
against invasion they actually sub went

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
against invasion they actually sub went
out<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.590> usually<00:00:58.829> been

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
out so I think they just usually been

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.099 
out so I think they just usually been
able<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> make<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.969> rather<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:01.079> know

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
able to make it rather than you know

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.240 
able to make it rather than you know
wanting<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> kick<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.890> think<00:01:04.890> arrow

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
wanting to kick in but I think arrow

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
wanting to kick in but I think arrow
still<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.119> shaky<00:01:06.479> since

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
still going to be little shaky since

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.580 
still going to be little shaky since
