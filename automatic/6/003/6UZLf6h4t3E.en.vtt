00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
Minecraft but of course what is this

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
think we made it of course we did but as

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
think we made it of course we did but as
you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.799> videos<00:01:56.280> indeed<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030

under<00:01:58.890> water<00:01:59.430> lots<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.390> insight<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.990> strange

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350

tractor<00:02:01.979> assaults<00:02:02.520> yes<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.899> he<00:02:04.079> could

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
tractor assaults yes so I think he could

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.620 
tractor assaults yes so I think he could
this<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> mean

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.330

is underwater you know videos and of
course<00:02:14.590> as<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.010> can<00:02:15.040> see<00:02:15.280> mr.<00:02:15.520> Jarry

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
course as you can see mr. Jarry

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.670 
course as you can see mr. Jarry
scurrying<00:02:16.180> around<00:02:16.270> underwater<00:02:16.930> perhaps

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
scurrying around underwater perhaps

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.560 
scurrying around underwater perhaps

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
upgrades of some sort and as you can see

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.370 
upgrades of some sort and as you can see
it<00:02:22.030> appears<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.720> be<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> labyrinth<00:02:23.260> of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
it appears to be a labyrinth of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.290 
it appears to be a labyrinth of
interconnecting<00:02:24.100> rooms<00:02:24.280> each<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.000> their

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
interconnecting rooms each with their

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.430 
interconnecting rooms each with their

macelli<00:02:27.810> underwater<00:02:28.810> k<00:02:29.140> or<00:02:29.350> something<00:02:29.710> like

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
macelli underwater k or something like

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.560 
macelli underwater k or something like
that<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.340> seems<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> very<00:02:31.300> specific

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
that it seems to have a very specific

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.050 
that it seems to have a very specific
design<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.770> does<00:02:33.010> her<00:02:33.160> by<00:02:33.340> night<00:02:33.550> as<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.880> can

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
design it does her by night as you can

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.850 
design it does her by night as you can
see<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.600> room<00:02:34.810> yeah<00:02:35.110> we<00:02:35.410> haven't<00:02:35.710> been

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
see in this room yeah we haven't been

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.590 
see in this room yeah we haven't been
able<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.250> reproduce<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.850> blocks<00:02:37.090> exactly

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
able to reproduce the blocks exactly

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.390 
able to reproduce the blocks exactly
because<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.990> course<00:02:38.290> there's<00:02:38.650> block<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> doomed

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
because of course there's block a doomed

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.980 
because of course there's block a doomed
yet<00:02:39.640> exists<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.180> Minecraft<00:02:40.690> when<00:02:40.870> he's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
yet exists in Minecraft when he's

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.420 
yet exists in Minecraft when he's
showing<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.740> are<00:02:41.770> some<00:02:42.130> sort<00:02:42.160> of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
showing that they are some sort of

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.220 
showing that they are some sort of
strange<00:02:42.820> block<00:02:43.240> there's<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.570> white<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:43.990> there

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
strange block there's a white one there

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.020 
strange block there's a white one there
with<00:02:44.380> rings<00:02:44.650> what<00:02:44.890> there's<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.310> strange<00:02:45.700> sort

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
with rings what there's a strange sort

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.300 
with rings what there's a strange sort
of<00:02:46.090> well<00:02:46.270> earthy<00:02:46.810> sort<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.140> scary<00:02:47.560> texture<00:02:48.040> yes

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
of well earthy sort of scary texture yes

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.710 
of well earthy sort of scary texture yes
might<00:02:48.580> perhaps<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.060> are<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> new<00:02:49.420> stone

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
might perhaps you are the new stone

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.750 
might perhaps you are the new stone
blocks<00:02:49.960> I'm<00:02:50.110> not<00:02:50.290> sure<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:50.830> indeed<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.430> suits

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
blocks I'm not sure but indeed it suits

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.610 
blocks I'm not sure but indeed it suits
the<00:02:51.910> underwater<00:02:52.300> theme<00:02:52.540> quite<00:02:52.870> well<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.260> as

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the underwater theme quite well and as

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.170 
the underwater theme quite well and as
you<00:02:53.830> can<00:02:53.950> see<00:02:54.100> from<00:02:54.220> armored<00:02:54.550> copy<00:02:54.730> art<00:02:54.940> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
you can see from armored copy art it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.730 
you can see from armored copy art it
will<00:02:55.330> appear<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.260> sort<00:02:56.680> of

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
will appear to be a sort of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.830 
will appear to be a sort of
interconnecting<00:02:57.460> well<00:02:57.940> strong<00:02:58.450> help<00:02:58.750> of

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
interconnecting well strong help of

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.880 
interconnecting well strong help of
sorts<00:02:59.140> rather<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> existing

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
sorts rather like the existing

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.530 
sorts rather like the existing
strongholds<00:03:00.550> but<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:00.850> time<00:03:01.120> underwater

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
strongholds but this time underwater

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.450 
strongholds but this time underwater
well<00:03:02.230> certainly<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.830> don't<00:03:03.040> actually<00:03:03.220> know

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
well certainly we don't actually know

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.320 
well certainly we don't actually know
what<00:03:08.070> knows<00:03:09.070> we'll<00:03:09.550> have<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.880> wait<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.270> see

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
what knows we'll have to wait and see

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.210 
what knows we'll have to wait and see
what<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.810> see<00:03:10.990> it's<00:03:11.110> most<00:03:11.440> exciting<00:03:11.950> there

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
what I do see it's most exciting there

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.740 
what I do see it's most exciting there
might<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.400> new<00:03:12.670> mobs<00:03:12.880> there<00:03:13.209> might<00:03:13.390> be<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.540> new

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
might be new mobs there might be a new

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.449 
might be new mobs there might be a new
