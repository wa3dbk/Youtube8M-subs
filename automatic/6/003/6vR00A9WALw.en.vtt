00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.560
 bastida of joy today I am something 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.760
 special imagine what right 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 really good 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.190
 jo i was like to be 14 years old than when 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.340
 this brilliant idea had its own 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.289
 video game oh ever user for one 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.020
 highly complex editing program 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 jailbreaker really a little 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.769
 editing program which certainly 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 was used for every nintendo game 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.869
 I mean of course enough 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.530
 depending on the degree celsius immediately speak 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.640
 imputed this masterpiece that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 play the origin plan one could say 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.930
 would it remains there would not exist 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.170
 you do not have that much either 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.930
 play peter ohl you play almost yourself 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.460
 cool as a dice or and now mine 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.770
 girlfriend is the best the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.500
 realistic animations here ever 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 innovative opponents have seen the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.899
 one hundred percent not from others 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.520
 were stolen 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.190
 a duck in the graphic at least with 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.199
 Crysis could compare ten if it were 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 give scene at all and one 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 act against the six rowling with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.200
 Harry Potter staking out the blight 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 Wow thinks heads of friends are 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 give up as so-called saarlandmeister 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.189
 and want to destroy the world mine 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.049
 hello saarland where 's that? 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 the highlight of the whole is the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.490
 so-called blow eternity with the man 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.939
 to float correctly and to have a certain distance 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.500
 where can this cross incredible 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.420
 of course, creative idea did not arise 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.509
 I will not live on a bug anymore 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.090
 suddenly there was a total release may it was 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.220
 You could say it's pure innovation 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.049
 man man man i should ubisoft the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 take over rockstar games at the same time 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 so great games again 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 you will now get people the game 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.970
 such an incredibly high response 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.649
 I still do that two years later 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.590
 masterpieces her masterpieces ali two 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.480
 stepped and again enjoyed the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.430
 most beautiful animation in the world 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.530
 almost ran so fast that one with the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.480
 just could not see 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.740
 innovative here, too 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.440
 fake enemies before you 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.510
 nowhere and the noblest battles 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.040
 can ever imagine yes 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.860
 probably not in the game 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.630
 this ghost comes from saarland 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.290
 came back and were still this time 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.250
 in fact briefly asked what kind of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.130
 turn 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.530
 do you want a 423,000 degrees turns 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.390
 you do not see anywhere else 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.890
 nowhere do I really tell you that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.960
 only thing that can be faulty about the game 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.240
 is that I'm still 1 million or so 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.250
 that's why billions made it 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.530
 find yourself five times something off 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.820
 comes into play or it is 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
 you could almost say a shame 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.690
 the each person but is realized 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.600
 do not stay 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.310
 the game helps me with this credo 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.840
 to spread it to everyone on this 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.570
 planets once gets the chance 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.210
 great miracle and video game forward too 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.350
 marvel I incidentally also observed 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.710
 the two players on my last 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.690
 as if their last more of 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.850
 want to see spectacular placed on the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.640
 playlist and got through with quasi 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.170
 we'll do the skystop one 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.670
 Survey in the comments 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.480
 should i download the two games 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.340
 if yes, if one writes 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.700
 no i 'm friends looking forward to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.700
 the result
