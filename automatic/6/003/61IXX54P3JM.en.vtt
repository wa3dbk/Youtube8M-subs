today<00:00:10.709> so<00:00:10.949> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.879> bit<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.209> a<00:00:12.270> transformer

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
today so this is a bit of a transformer

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.049 
today so this is a bit of a transformer
this<00:00:12.930> is<00:00:13.230> perfect<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:13.860> field<00:00:14.340> applications

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
this is perfect for field applications

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
this is perfect for field applications

Allen<00:00:50.430> sirs<00:00:50.580> have<00:00:50.790> been<00:00:50.970> around<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> while

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
Allen sirs have been around for a while

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.180 
Allen sirs have been around for a while
but<00:00:51.810> this<00:00:51.930> definitely<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.530> few<00:00:52.800> tricks<00:00:52.920> up

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
but this definitely has a few tricks up

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
but this definitely has a few tricks up
its<00:00:53.310> sleeve<00:00:53.400> obviously<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> first<00:00:54.720> thing<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
its sleeve obviously the first thing is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
its sleeve obviously the first thing is
is<00:00:55.290> that<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:56.040> break<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.580> be<00:00:56.640> nice

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
is that it can break down and be nice

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
is that it can break down and be nice
and<00:00:57.060> compact<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.720> so<00:00:57.900> you<00:00:57.990> can<00:00:58.110> just<00:00:58.320> throw<00:00:58.470> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and compact up so you can just throw it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.620 
and compact up so you can just throw it
in<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:58.770> field<00:00:58.980> box<00:00:59.220> if<00:00:59.400> necessary<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
in your field box if necessary so you

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.030 
in your field box if necessary so you
break<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> prop<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.320> while<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:01.620> flying<00:01:01.800> or

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
break a prop out while you're flying or

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.170 
break a prop out while you're flying or
something<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.880> few<00:01:03.060> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
something like that and got a few in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
something like that and got a few in
your<00:01:03.270> box<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.630> don't<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> pre<00:01:04.260> balance

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
your box you don't have to pre balance

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.960 
your box you don't have to pre balance
them<00:01:04.770> they're<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.160> ready<00:01:05.370> to<00:01:05.490> do<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.850> out

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
them they're just ready to do right out

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.180 
them they're just ready to do right out
of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> field<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.260> other<00:01:07.380> nice<00:01:07.620> cool<00:01:08.010> thing

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
of the field the other nice cool thing

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.040 
of the field the other nice cool thing
about<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.940> we've<00:01:09.330> designed<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
about this is that we've designed it to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.360 
about this is that we've designed it to
be<00:01:10.170> able<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> utilize<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.190> newer

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
be able to utilize some of the newer

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.530 
be able to utilize some of the newer
props<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.880> coming<00:01:12.180> onto<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> market

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540

that have been having issues as far as

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.820 
that have been having issues as far as
balancing<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.660> what<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.050> talking<00:01:16.380> about<00:01:16.440> is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
balancing and what I'm talking about is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
balancing and what I'm talking about is
this<00:01:17.310> style<00:01:17.610> crop<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.210> here

centering the propeller up normally it's
a<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.490> washer<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> call<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.869> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
a top washer that has that call it in it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
a top washer that has that call it in it
and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.500> three<00:01:37.830> millimeter<00:01:38.220> bolts<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and then two three millimeter bolts that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
and then two three millimeter bolts that
bolted<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.150> mainly<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> multi<00:01:40.650> rotor

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
bolted on mainly for the multi rotor

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
bolted on mainly for the multi rotor
range<00:01:41.130> starting<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.910> in<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.119> little

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
range starting to make it in a little

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
range starting to make it in a little
bit<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> aircraft<00:01:43.050> range<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.650> really

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bit of the aircraft range but really

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.070 
bit of the aircraft range but really
difficult<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> balance<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:45.570> props<00:01:45.869> because

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
difficult to balance these props because

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.219 
difficult to balance these props because
it<00:01:46.380> doesn't<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.550> big<00:01:47.990> center<00:01:48.990> core

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it doesn't have a very big center core

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.779 
it doesn't have a very big center core
there<00:01:49.410> section<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.039> able<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> put<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> two

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
there section to be able to put the two

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.700 
there section to be able to put the two
cones<00:01:51.030> into<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.899> what<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.170> did<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.380> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
cones into it so what we did on this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.180 
cones into it so what we did on this
particular<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:54.380> right<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> edge<00:01:56.160> of

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
particular one is right at the edge of

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
millimeter call it machined into it and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.440 
millimeter call it machined into it and
what<00:02:02.069> you're<00:02:02.220> able<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.910> a<00:02:02.940> standard

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
what you're able to do with a standard

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
what you're able to do with a standard
propeller<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.740> cone<00:02:05.069> in<00:02:05.280> cone<00:02:05.520> in

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
propeller you just go cone in cone in

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.999 
propeller you just go cone in cone in
like<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.170> T<00:02:07.380> style<00:02:07.649> propeller

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
like that and with the T style propeller

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.830 
like that and with the T style propeller
what<00:02:08.220> you're<00:02:08.340> able<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.270> ahead<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
what you're able to do is go ahead and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200 
what you're able to do is go ahead and
take<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.710> flip<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.819> them<00:02:11.940> around

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
take this and flip one of them around

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.390 
take this and flip one of them around
and<00:02:12.600> it's<00:02:13.050> machined<00:02:13.470> with<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> recess<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and it's machined with a recess in the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.950 
and it's machined with a recess in the
back<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.850> both<00:02:15.030> cones<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.690> use<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
back on both cones so you can use it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.570 
back on both cones so you can use it
either<00:02:16.080> way

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
either way

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.190 
either way
and<00:02:17.580> I'll<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.819> back<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.240> out<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.600> since

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and I'll just back that out and since

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.870 
and I'll just back that out and since
you<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.560> four<00:02:19.770> millimeter<00:02:20.280> hole<00:02:20.670> right

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
you have that four millimeter hole right

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.670 
you have that four millimeter hole right
there<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.480> does<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.870> take<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> tee<00:02:22.410> style

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
there what that does is take a tee style

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.010 
there what that does is take a tee style
prop<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.310> centers<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.240> four<00:02:24.510> millimeter

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
prop it centers on that four millimeter

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.900 
prop it centers on that four millimeter
so<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.470> centered<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.950> way<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.400> same<00:02:26.580> as<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
so it's centered this way the same as it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
so it's centered this way the same as it
would<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.420> motor<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.810> use<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> flat

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
would be on the motor and use the flat

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.699 
would be on the motor and use the flat
of<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.340> other<00:02:29.640> cone<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.140> ahead<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
of the other cone and just go ahead and

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.390 
of the other cone and just go ahead and
run<00:02:31.980> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
run that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.699 
run that
on<00:02:32.459> down<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.629> let<00:02:33.750> me<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.319> down<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
on down so let me just get that down and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.059 
on down so let me just get that down and
I'll<00:02:34.830> show<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.069> what<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.670> able<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.209> do

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.240 

okay

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
okay

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.460 
okay
so<00:02:41.400> right<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.780> not<00:02:42.989> centered<00:02:43.379> off

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so right out there it's not centered off

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.860 
so right out there it's not centered off
the<00:02:43.590> continents<00:02:44.040> from<00:02:44.159> a<00:02:44.659> centigrade<00:02:45.659> out<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the continents from a centigrade out to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.539 
the continents from a centigrade out to
four<00:02:46.080> millimeters<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:46.860> got<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.129> nice<00:02:47.280> flat

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
four millimeters it's got the nice flat

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.430 
four millimeters it's got the nice flat
section<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.299> like<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.659> would<00:02:48.840> be<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.140> motor

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
section just like it would be on a motor

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380 
section just like it would be on a motor
and<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:50.280> centered<00:02:50.549> up<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:51.090> ahead<00:02:51.180> and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
and it's centered up just go ahead and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.089 
and it's centered up just go ahead and
Chuck<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.590> are<00:02:52.620> able<00:02:53.069> to

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
Chuck that in there and you are able to

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.250 
Chuck that in there and you are able to
balance<00:02:53.400> out<00:02:53.730> your<00:02:53.760> carbon<00:02:54.329> props<00:02:54.599> or<00:02:54.840> t-style

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
balance out your carbon props or t-style

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.280 
balance out your carbon props or t-style
props<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:56.239> with<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.390> particular<00:02:57.840> balancer

now<00:02:58.829> these<00:02:59.040> magnets<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.360> extremely

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
now these magnets on there are extremely

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.839 
now these magnets on there are extremely
powerful<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:01.980> handle<00:03:02.129> a<00:03:02.340> large<00:03:02.549> prop

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
powerful so it can handle a large prop

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.880 
powerful so it can handle a large prop
I've<00:03:03.000> had<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> 17<00:03:03.690> inch<00:03:03.810> drop<00:03:04.019> on<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.349> no<00:03:04.500> problem
