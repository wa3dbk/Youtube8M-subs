00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
but you'll hear it snap and then you

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.720 
but you'll hear it snap and then you
just<00:02:44.090> lift<00:02:44.239> up<00:02:44.450> very<00:02:44.690> gently<00:02:45.080> I'd<00:02:46.010> hat<00:02:46.519> I'd

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
just lift up very gently I'd hat I'd

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.770 
just lift up very gently I'd hat I'd
take<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.390> off<00:02:48.459> by<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.519> backing<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.569> because

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
take it off by the backing just because

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.470 
take it off by the backing just because
it's<00:02:50.930> easier<00:02:51.400> just<00:02:52.400> take<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.790> put<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.269> off<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
it's easier just take this put it off to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.520 
it's easier just take this put it off to
the<00:02:53.600> side<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:55.600> here's<00:02:56.600> where<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
the side so here's where you have the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.350 
the side so here's where you have the
battery<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.010> motherboard<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:59.060> all<00:02:59.209> the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360

buttons underneath it so you want to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.830 
buttons underneath it so you want to
just<00:03:01.430> flip<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.970> battery<00:03:02.120> up<00:03:02.360> there<00:03:02.660> might<00:03:02.810> be

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
just flip the battery up there might be

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.990 
just flip the battery up there might be
a<00:03:02.930> tray<00:03:03.230> there<00:03:03.470> might<00:03:03.590> not<00:03:03.739> be<00:03:03.920> flip<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
a tray there might not be flip the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.580 
a tray there might not be flip the
battery<00:03:05.239> up<00:03:05.390> put<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> tray<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.170> side<00:03:06.380> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
battery up put the tray to the side and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.559 
battery up put the tray to the side and
just<00:03:07.340> pull<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.670> out<00:03:07.730> very<00:03:07.970> gently<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.480> don't

to take these r1 and r2 and l2 buttons
out<00:03:36.590> yet<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.880> because<00:03:38.150> they're<00:03:38.359> attached<00:03:39.019> to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
out yet just because they're attached to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.770 
out yet just because they're attached to
the<00:03:39.320> ribbon<00:03:39.769> cable<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.269> don't<00:03:41.510> know<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.690> you

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
the ribbon cable so I don't know if you

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.590 
the ribbon cable so I don't know if you
can<00:03:41.840> see<00:03:42.079> this<00:03:42.340> see<00:03:43.340> if<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.579> can<00:03:43.989> focus<00:03:46.600> but

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
can see this see if this can focus but

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.500 
can see this see if this can focus but
this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.840> screw<00:03:48.140> right<00:03:48.290> here<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:50.209> need<00:03:50.450> to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
this is screw right here you need to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.310 
this is screw right here you need to
take<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.320> out<00:03:52.480> all<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.690> screws<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.109> same

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
take that out all the screws the same

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:03.550 
take that out all the screws the same
size<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:54.829> it<00:03:54.890> doesn't<00:03:55.160> matter<00:03:57.910> but<00:03:58.910> um

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.770 

once<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.650> get<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:04.920> out<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.599> little<00:04:06.599> bit<00:04:06.690> of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
once you get that out a little bit of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.920 
once you get that out a little bit of
trouble<00:04:07.970> put<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.090> down<00:04:09.300> make<00:04:09.660> sure<00:04:09.840> you

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
trouble put this down make sure you

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.949 
trouble put this down make sure you
don't<00:04:10.080> lose<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.580> so<00:04:11.580> now<00:04:11.790> here's<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.269> tricky

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
don't lose it so now here's the tricky

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.080 
don't lose it so now here's the tricky
part<00:04:12.989> well<00:04:13.319> it's<00:04:13.440> not<00:04:13.560> really<00:04:13.709> tricky<00:04:14.129> but<00:04:14.280> you

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
part well it's not really tricky but you

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.430 
part well it's not really tricky but you
want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.330> make<00:04:15.450> sure<00:04:15.480> all<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.900> buttons<00:04:16.260> stay

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
want to make sure all the buttons stay

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.439 
want to make sure all the buttons stay
in<00:04:16.500> here<00:04:16.739> it's<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.639> much<00:04:17.910> easier<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.329> put

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
in here it's just so much easier to put

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.289 
in here it's just so much easier to put
it<00:04:18.570> back<00:04:18.690> together<00:04:18.840> later<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:20.130> um<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:21.150> want

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
it back together later but um you want

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.240 
it back together later but um you want
to<00:04:21.359> lift<00:04:21.570> up<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.150> see<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:25.320> our<00:04:25.710> two

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
to lift up and you can see that our two

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.290 
to lift up and you can see that our two
and<00:04:26.280> l2<00:04:26.910> button<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.630> flop<00:04:28.290> down<00:04:28.530> basically

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
and l2 button just flop down basically

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.439 
and l2 button just flop down basically
and<00:04:30.300> slipped<00:04:30.930> out<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.639> here<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.850> the

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
and slipped out but here is the

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.860 
and slipped out but here is the
motherboard<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.250> plastic<00:04:35.250> piece<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.870> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
