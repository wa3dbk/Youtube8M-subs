this<00:00:22.080> circle<00:00:22.590> will<00:00:22.830> represent<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.660> bottom

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this circle will represent up the bottom

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.330 
this circle will represent up the bottom
part<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> trick<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.060> try<00:00:27.269> circle<00:00:28.340> ok

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
part of this trick so just try circle ok

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
part of this trick so just try circle ok
so<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.660> planning<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.500> join

this<00:00:31.890> drink<00:00:32.189> pretty<00:00:32.489> big<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.329> make<00:00:33.570> sure<00:00:33.600> what

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this drink pretty big so make sure what

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
this drink pretty big so make sure what
is<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.530> pretty<00:00:34.739> big<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
is so go pretty big and we got a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.319 
is so go pretty big and we got a
rectangle<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.719> top<00:00:37.190> ok<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.210> oh

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
rectangle on the top ok so we think oh

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
rectangle on the top ok so we think oh
it's<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.200> size<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.070> circle

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's about the same size as the circle

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.650 
it's about the same size as the circle
so<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.090> will<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.420> representing<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:44.670> cup<00:00:45.059> all

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
so this will be representing the cup all

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
so this will be representing the cup all
right<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.800> let<00:00:46.920> me<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.520> my

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
right they don't let me get out my

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.520 
right they don't let me get out my
sloppy<00:00:49.879> all<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.000> finally<00:00:51.750> got<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.079> myself

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
sloppy all right finally got by myself

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.180 
sloppy all right finally got by myself
II<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.809> under<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.020> Paul<00:00:55.320> guy<00:00:55.379> curve<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
II get so under this Paul guy curve and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.740 
II get so under this Paul guy curve and
line<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.329> start<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.629> here

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
line down so you can start right here

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.560 
line down so you can start right here
then<00:00:58.739> curve<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.579> according<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
then curve down according to the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
then curve down according to the
guidelines<00:01:00.840> soak<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.500> curve<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.250> here

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
guidelines soak up curve all right here

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.479 
guidelines soak up curve all right here
because<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.000> single<00:01:03.719> anchor<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:05.250> like

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
because this is single anchor down like

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
because this is single anchor down like
this<00:01:05.729> alright<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.140> dark<00:01:07.580> side

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this alright so this will be dark side

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.330 
this alright so this will be dark side
part<00:01:08.880> they've<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.350> almost<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.070> same

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
part they've got to almost the same

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.160 
part they've got to almost the same
thing<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:11.909> side<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.689> curve

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
thing on the other side so just curve

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.240 
thing on the other side so just curve
8900<00:01:14.509> ok<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.439> pull<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> bound

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
8900 ok as you get and pull the bound

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.950 
8900 ok as you get and pull the bound
curve<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:19.890> represent<00:01:20.100> our

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
curve out so this will represent our

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.469 
curve out so this will represent our
bottom<00:01:21.960> part<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.850> ok<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.210> we're<00:01:24.330> gonna

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
bottom part right ok then we're gonna

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.080 
bottom part right ok then we're gonna
add<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.290> part<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:26.009> also<00:01:26.430> try<00:01:26.820> another

add this part we can also try another

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.620 
add this part we can also try another
snip<00:01:27.710> smaller<00:01:28.710> circle<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.630> alright

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
