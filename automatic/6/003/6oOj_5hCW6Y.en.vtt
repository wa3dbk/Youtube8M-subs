black<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.110> inside<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.290> on<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.770> side

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
black one inside out and on the side

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.639 
black one inside out and on the side
trim<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:06.329> made<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:07.110> interesting

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
trim here they made a very interesting

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.300 
trim here they made a very interesting
color<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.569> bluish<00:02:10.170> metallic<00:02:11.069> grey

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
color which is a bluish metallic grey

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.670 
color which is a bluish metallic grey
and<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.080> chose

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and I think they chose

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.849 
and I think they chose
color<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:15.359> will<00:02:15.540> look<00:02:15.750> great<00:02:16.469> with

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
color because it will look great with

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.080 
color because it will look great with
both<00:02:17.790> black<00:02:18.420> or<00:02:18.750> white<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.469> found<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.909> goes

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
both black or white I found so it goes

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.080 
both black or white I found so it goes
really<00:02:21.359> well<00:02:21.510> together<00:02:22.400> let's<00:02:23.400> move<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.909> to

really well together let's move on to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.020 
really well together let's move on to
the<00:02:24.269> white<00:02:24.450> case<00:02:25.069> this<00:02:26.069> one<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.790> glossy

so this will not go in all the way so

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.680 
so this will not go in all the way so
you'll<00:05:41.050> need<00:05:41.410> this<00:05:41.620> adapter<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:43.330> get<00:05:43.510> this

you'll need this adapter to get this
working<00:05:45.240> like<00:05:46.240> that<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:48.210> that's<00:05:49.210> it<00:05:49.570> for<00:05:49.900> my
