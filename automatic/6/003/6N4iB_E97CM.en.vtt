00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.859
 Johanner must be the youtube user some here he is a firmer one 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.399
 with another one 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:16.490
 Video 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.490
 and this time is about the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.499
 Mirror foil provided in front of it comes de 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.720
 Many do not even say then 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.769
 there are many many different that protection years ago 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.699
 many different phones 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.820
 then I also outraged digital cameras for computers 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.700
 I think that he is the least for a cell phone before 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.769
 Nos 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.809
 Smartphone generation should be the Kapsch customer 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.440
 necessarily points 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 Okayama the whole first 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.830
 the bonds should be small flyers 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.600
 here the eighth separates the protection from noise 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.420
 Here are the instructions 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.160
 want to attach Abbas to the city 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 but that may be the case when he buys for the time being 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.290
 even 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.410
 read through the front right then stands for which cases it is there so 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.650
 no confusion 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.230
 besides, that is also here in the upper area all registers 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.820
 Protective films many decided Kalu 99 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.230
 init the members Glen Vella 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.840
 Barbara to Jan's to bring once an exquisite and a jersey at the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.350
 trip 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 There are both as saying in the case of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.080
 the gate both tell us Greens and SPD 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.090
 I'm really very practical with the smoke saying + I already have the festival 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.530
 I'm sorry 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.479
 many pull 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.320
 absolutely 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.050
 one-sided the card because it's just harder a credit card is supposed to 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.550
 the Blickschutz last year from the video you will find in the intestine relieved by 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.550
 look 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.800
 Black so that 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.980
 he does not want to end a footbridge 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.290
 nothing more 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.810
 the former into the gate 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.869
 about his men 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.330
 clean his phone thoroughly 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.830
 That's what I'm saying now so I'm putting you on the boat 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.440
 if he does not get a single hotel here 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.799
 located on it 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.819
 could you keep the state 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.629
 and it's a funny guy in the right direction 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.629
 Oh the displays Schulviertel say quirky paragraphs 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.439
 you bring them to a place where you look exactly right 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.139
 Analysis and I could not pilot these 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.099
 and up here 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.099
 why the five deep Queenie 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.779
 after the girl to wear 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.779
 On average I saw that very well 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.589
 paint them are the cappuccinos under it 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.509
 Cooper Martin Freeman get out 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.749
 if I go some things halftime 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 some bubbles still 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.329
 it stays very bad 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.239
 After all, having a beautiful one is very convenient 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.049
 then I do not need to bother so much 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.869
 the previous years 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:06.269
 So listen are two little bubbles 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.289
 the world is still removed 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.649
 but may take some time with the Squibb BMS Islands Jacobs 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.189
 are provided or what it is 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.519
 now is the TSB 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.430
 it reflects 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.750
 perfect you can see everything 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.450
 so it's just he's older it's really a very good player 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.039
 what he can look at is his, even though he is no longer light 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.469
 show the projectile euro 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.269
 When I switch it all the last time you will see my top-level 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.819
 I still play a bit but if I come in now, that's it 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.059
 not so bad 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:44.439
 the memorials minimized to that and already the reflection on the display is already 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.519
 Like light, it still reflects something that has a mirror protective film 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.280
 However, I had no respect at that time despite full 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.140
 Of course he also has some play as he slowly becomes clear about one 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.700
 Outsider St to get results one dares to rejoice for 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.120
 Irony mostly on around the Saalburg 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.819
 marching separately 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.039
 Possibilities for selecting poem cleverly project 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:09.660
 I am fuller again 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.350
 so big very nice first satisfied bubbles you really do not pull so 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.590
 so far only a little 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.239
 that was no longer possible 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.730
 But now I'm starting to look at it in the century 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.430
 Description Ultimately, the bubbles will start with 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.020
 make the squeeze-out very easy out that means it has been there 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.779
 Shift it is really important 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.439
 to chat 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.050
 dgb-chef one more beautiful day 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.930
 you can see light and off again
