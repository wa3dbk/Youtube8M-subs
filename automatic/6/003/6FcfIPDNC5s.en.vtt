not level 36 yet you guys can do the
mission<00:01:44.579> pod<00:01:44.850> shot<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.509> usually<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> believe

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
mission pod shot which usually I believe

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.800 
mission pod shot which usually I believe
pays<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:47.060> $12,000<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.720> gonna

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pays out $12,000 so right now it's gonna

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.170 
pays out $12,000 so right now it's gonna
be<00:01:48.960> paying<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.430> $24,000<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:50.909> takes

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
be paying out $24,000 it only takes

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
be paying out $24,000 it only takes
about<00:01:51.270> three<00:01:51.689> minutes<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.170> actually<00:01:52.799> complete

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
about three minutes to actually complete

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
about three minutes to actually complete
and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.670> shouldn't<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> link<00:01:54.659> down<00:01:54.869> below

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
for that one because I believe that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
for that one because I believe that
mission<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.689> playlisted<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.530> that's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
mission can be playlisted so that's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
mission can be playlisted so that's
another<00:02:02.009> great<00:02:02.250> mission<00:02:02.610> pod<00:02:02.850> shot<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
another great mission pod shot and to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840 
another great mission pod shot and to
end<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> guys<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.439> above<00:02:04.770> level<00:02:04.979> 36<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
end if you guys are above level 36 and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.760 
end if you guys are above level 36 and
you<00:02:05.880> guys<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.270> also<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> mission<00:02:07.200> coveted

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
you guys can also do the mission coveted

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
you guys can also do the mission coveted
the<00:02:08.099> mission<00:02:08.459> coveted<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.420> about<00:02:09.660> as

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the mission coveted is just about as

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
the mission coveted is just about as
good<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.140> rooftop<00:02:10.530> rumble<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.009> actually<00:02:11.430> pays

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
good as rooftop rumble it actually pays

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.309 
good as rooftop rumble it actually pays
out<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.180> same<00:02:12.390> amount<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.989> believe

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
out the same amount and I believe

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.679 
out the same amount and I believe
Eve<00:02:13.469> might<00:02:14.129> even<00:02:14.400> give<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.849> almost<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.480> same

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
Eve might even give out almost the same

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.330 
Eve might even give out almost the same
amounts<00:02:16.049> of<00:02:16.140> our<00:02:16.260> piece<00:02:16.469> so<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.739> usually<00:02:16.920> pays

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
amounts of our piece so it usually pays

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.949 
amounts of our piece so it usually pays
out<00:02:18.950> 17250<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.370> today<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.359> should<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.689> paying

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
out 17250 and today it should be paying

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.449 
out 17250 and today it should be paying
out<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.170> guess<00:02:22.319> thirty<00:02:22.650> four<00:02:22.920> thousand<00:02:23.310> five
