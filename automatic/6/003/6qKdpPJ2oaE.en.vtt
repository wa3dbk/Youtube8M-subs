00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.510
 sweaty player stressed coach 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280
 and tense team manager sitting 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.400
 usually during the interview today 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.350
 it is a little more pleasant in the picture me 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.710
 here is the sina the officiating miss 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:46.309
 waldmohr Hello you are in the area 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.210
 time when since 2009 with interruption 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.850
 I have to take a break for two years because 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.250
 I had grown quite a bit but now 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600
 I am fully back and you are you 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.420
 originally came to it 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.040
 I saw the claudia bormann that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.020
 the miss was Rhineland-Palatinate and 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.149
 thought you could try it too 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.890
 and then I have that I have me 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.960
 advertised 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.930
 gold and how it goes on what will be added 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.180
 you will come next on sunday 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.770
 the roman wine route was and im 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.670
 december was the miss rhineland-palatinate 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.840
 because I became tomorrow 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.020
 I am now at the Rhineland-Palatinate was 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.759
 and how it goes then 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.790
 set the case you come now both 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.979
 Rhineland Palatinate continued to profit from this 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 whole thing and then it goes into it 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.369
 miss camp where exactly is i know 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.170
 not yet 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.799
 and then it goes to the miss germany choice 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.439
 miss camp is so conceivable 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.020
 how these camps are looking for Germany 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.130
 the superstar or something like that gets there 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.780
 you bend a bend course and stop 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.710
 so running training with the monica 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.850
 Ivancan 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.240
 This year that was yes and yes 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.240
 Behavior rules you get said and so 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.759
 a bit of training moderately stop that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.320
 you know what you're getting into everyone 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.050
 Most cases find that something always 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.479
 in mallorca 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.220
 it sounds a bit bigger is there 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.110
 maybe even then maybe watch tv 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.580
 or something like that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.120
 television is here last year was vox 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.160
 and we also had celebrities 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.010
 jury of the marcus schenkenberg 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.300
 example the male model was then 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.890
 who was the regina halmich I believe 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.890
 there 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.160
 I do not think so but I'm not the one 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.710
 Monica Ivancan Ross Antony was there 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.630
 because the ross antony his man was there 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.150
 and a bunch of other celebrities 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.830
 people want the jury so good at fox 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.570
 expensive which also katzenberger to 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.130
 Maybe this time the jury 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.050
 I can not imagine that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.660
 because in the miss germany election is 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.850
 to be natural and not like daniela 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.240
 katzenberger but this is a great 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.980
 woman but not for miss-choice i 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.580
 Believe me, of course, with her husband 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.590
 for months maybe yes, but from 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.800
 make up and from the han and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.440
 Silicone moderately good as mine im 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.720
 background sees is to lie 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.000
 numerous fan articles from fk pirmasens 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.000
 before and we will come soon 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 to the full were the jerseys andy 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.900
 Penteli still in the background of us 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.390
 both of you and you are already wearing 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.769
 rico and jersey pants from fk pirmasens 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.780
 here on the tribune 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.109
 are you new games of our themes 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.849
 so sporty for the visual elements 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.120
 I am not but we take pictures 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.819
 for the fan catalog and yes I am then 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.519
 the advertising face of fkp for the pd 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.419
 fanshop that's an interesting one 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.639
 History how did we get there? 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.590
 been the game at the fk p the first 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.479
 home game is first season plays 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.910
 You can do that at all this year 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.570
 play what shit so the suffering so what 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.990
 has to bring in a nice game was not 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.180
 quite so simple but I have the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.940
 looked at catalog and thought there must be something 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.810
 we have new good with it now 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.370
 initiated and what is any 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.320
 there is a certain intention behind it 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.410
 we could succeed together 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.139
 that is, the fkp rises on me 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.000
 make mine is germany and yes 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.560
 maybe even in the bundesliga 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.449
 the fkp but in the third that would be 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.120
 a pleasant goal, we hope 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.669
 that you go the direction 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.669
 may two of the pictures and then back 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:49.170
 rosina here in the holy vacate the 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.690
 me in the cabin of the crew of the fk 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.240
 pirmasens whose in the webshop but clarified 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.800
 fan catalogs we also clarified now times 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.480
 Maybe you have an idea 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.210
 what else could you do with me 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.880
 you and fdp I've been thinking that 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.550
 perhaps we could hand over pokal 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.650
 or at tombola like the car to 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.340
 example, that I'm doing the transfer 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.650
 or so 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.240
 yes maybe I could be there too 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.320
 the players interview 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.320
 then I would be unemployed
