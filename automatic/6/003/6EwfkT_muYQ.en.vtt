quickly grabbing another piece see that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.180 
quickly grabbing another piece see that
won't<00:04:55.480> even<00:04:55.600> falls<00:04:55.930> out<00:04:56.200> but<00:04:56.470> that's<00:04:56.650> ok<00:04:57.010> cuz

you<00:05:49.090> enjoyed<00:05:49.480> it<00:05:49.480> I<00:05:49.930> think<00:05:50.290> it<00:05:50.440> would<00:05:50.560> look

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
you enjoyed it I think it would look

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.900 
you enjoyed it I think it would look
super<00:05:51.190> cute<00:05:51.580> on<00:05:51.940> a<00:05:52.600> white<00:05:52.930> wall<00:05:53.200> or<00:05:53.650> maybe

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
super cute on a white wall or maybe

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.840 
super cute on a white wall or maybe
above<00:05:54.910> your<00:05:55.150> mantle<00:05:55.660> or<00:05:55.930> on<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.140> door<00:05:56.850> obviously

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
above your mantle or on a door obviously

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.180 
above your mantle or on a door obviously
I<00:05:58.090> wouldn't<00:05:58.390> put<00:05:58.630> it<00:05:58.660> outside<00:05:58.980> since<00:05:59.980> it's

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
I wouldn't put it outside since it's

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.000 
I wouldn't put it outside since it's
made<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.520> paper<00:06:01.169> but<00:06:02.169> I<00:06:02.470> think<00:06:02.770> it's<00:06:02.890> a<00:06:02.980> great

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
made of paper but I think it's a great

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.890 
made of paper but I think it's a great
project<00:06:03.490> I<00:06:03.820> don't<00:06:04.030> think<00:06:04.240> i<00:06:04.300> would<00:06:04.360> do<00:06:04.630> it<00:06:04.780> with

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
project I don't think i would do it with

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.740 
project I don't think i would do it with
kids<00:06:05.260> because<00:06:06.070> this<00:06:06.550> hot<00:06:06.790> glue<00:06:07.000> does<00:06:07.480> turn

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
kids because this hot glue does turn

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.350 
kids because this hot glue does turn
tend<00:06:08.320> to<00:06:08.500> burn<00:06:08.680> if<00:06:09.070> you<00:06:09.610> get<00:06:09.820> some<00:06:10.060> on<00:06:10.090> your

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
tend to burn if you get some on your

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.470 
tend to burn if you get some on your
fingers<00:06:10.750> but<00:06:11.140> otherwise<00:06:12.100> I<00:06:12.669> think<00:06:13.090> it's<00:06:13.419> a

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
fingers but otherwise I think it's a

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.680 
fingers but otherwise I think it's a
great<00:06:13.600> project<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:14.350> I<00:06:14.950> have<00:06:15.160> a<00:06:15.190> lot<00:06:15.550> of<00:06:15.850> paper

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
great project and I have a lot of paper

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.780 
great project and I have a lot of paper
left<00:06:16.990> over<00:06:17.320> so<00:06:17.560> you<00:06:17.620> probably<00:06:17.950> don't<00:06:18.340> need<00:06:18.550> the

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
left over so you probably don't need the

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.630 
left over so you probably don't need the
whole<00:06:18.970> package<00:06:19.950> you<00:06:20.950> probably<00:06:21.160> don't<00:06:21.280> need<00:06:21.490> to

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
whole package you probably don't need to

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.330 
whole package you probably don't need to
cut<00:06:21.820> it<00:06:21.970> all<00:06:22.150> up<00:06:22.290> but<00:06:23.290> you<00:06:23.770> can<00:06:23.919> make<00:06:24.040> another

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
cut it all up but you can make another

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.570 
cut it all up but you can make another
