started<00:00:35.600> developing<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.110> little<00:00:36.320> bit<00:00:36.530> of<00:00:36.650> a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
started developing a little bit of a

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.580 
started developing a little bit of a
stain<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:37.700> I<00:00:37.970> guess<00:00:38.780> it's<00:00:38.960> not<00:00:39.080> super

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
stain to it so I guess it's not super

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.490 
stain to it so I guess it's not super
duper<00:00:39.710> stainless<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:41.110> maybe<00:00:42.110> with<00:00:42.290> some<00:00:42.470> more

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
duper stainless I maybe with some more

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.900 
duper stainless I maybe with some more
cutting<00:00:42.890> but<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:43.160> is<00:00:43.310> just<00:00:43.490> some<00:00:43.610> basic

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
cutting but this is just some basic

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.950 
cutting but this is just some basic
cutting<00:00:44.150> you<00:00:44.270> see<00:00:44.420> we're<00:00:44.570> getting<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.840> little

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
cutting you see we're getting a little

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.410 
cutting you see we're getting a little
bit<00:00:45.200> of<00:00:45.290> they're<00:00:45.520> kind<00:00:46.520> of<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.700> stain<00:00:47.060> on<00:00:47.090> that

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
bit of they're kind of a stain on that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.130 
bit of they're kind of a stain on that
so<00:00:48.280> but<00:00:49.280> it's<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:49.970> great<00:00:50.120> knife<00:00:50.330> so<00:00:50.690> don't<00:00:50.870> let

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
so but it's a great knife so don't let

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.350 
so but it's a great knife so don't let

the metal or the are the rivets so it's
a<00:01:48.229> pretty<00:01:48.469> plain<00:01:49.399> handle<00:01:50.179> it's<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.200> pretty

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
a pretty plain handle it's it's pretty

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.179 
a pretty plain handle it's it's pretty
big

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
big

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.649 
big
I<00:01:52.219> shouldn't<00:01:52.639> say<00:01:52.759> it's<00:01:52.880> huge<00:01:53.149> but<00:01:53.359> it's<00:01:53.479> got

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
I shouldn't say it's huge but it's got

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.719 
I shouldn't say it's huge but it's got
some<00:01:53.840> substantial<00:01:54.409> size<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.859> it<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.369> it's<00:01:55.579> not

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
some substantial size to it and it's not

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.370 
some substantial size to it and it's not
super<00:01:55.939> rounded<00:01:56.420> it's<00:01:56.569> got<00:01:56.689> a<00:01:56.719> fairly<00:01:56.990> blocky

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
super rounded it's got a fairly blocky

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.349 
super rounded it's got a fairly blocky
edges<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.159> get<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.459> nice<00:01:58.609> grip<00:01:58.969> that<00:01:59.179> way

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
edges so you get a nice grip that way

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.059 
edges so you get a nice grip that way
but<00:01:59.929> it's<00:02:00.079> definitely<00:02:00.200> not<00:02:00.469> a<00:02:00.529> super<00:02:00.889> tiny

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
but it's definitely not a super tiny

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.429 
but it's definitely not a super tiny
handle<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.359> it's<00:02:02.479> got<00:02:02.630> some<00:02:02.659> meat<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.139> it<00:02:03.259> and

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
handle so it's got some meat to it and

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.830 
handle so it's got some meat to it and
just<00:02:04.279> basic<00:02:04.880> nothing<00:02:05.060> fancy<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.689> really

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
just basic nothing fancy but it really

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.109 
just basic nothing fancy but it really
works<00:02:06.079> well<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.859> star<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.609> this<00:02:07.700> knife<00:02:07.909> is

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
works well the star of this knife is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.559 
works well the star of this knife is
definitely<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.600> blade<00:02:08.840> you've<00:02:09.080> got<00:02:09.259> some

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
definitely the blade you've got some

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.179 
definitely the blade you've got some
screened<00:02:11.569> kanji<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.470> tells<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:12.980> blue

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
screened kanji on it tells you it's blue

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.600 
screened kanji on it tells you it's blue
number<00:02:13.489> two<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
number two and the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
let's see the balance point on this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.060 
let's see the balance point on this
blade<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.730> right<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.800> where<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.920> meets

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
blade is like right here where it meets

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
blade let's put it on our board this is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050 
blade let's put it on our board this is
kind<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.620> classic<00:02:38.860> all-around<00:02:39.490> profile<00:02:39.910> and

kind of a classic all-around profile and
that's<00:02:40.180> SuperDuper<00:02:40.870> flat<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.350> SuperDuper

that's SuperDuper flat not SuperDuper

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.660 
that's SuperDuper flat not SuperDuper
curvy<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.200> works<00:02:44.410> well<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.920> board<00:02:45.130> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
curvy but it works well on the board you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.400 
curvy but it works well on the board you
don't<00:02:45.880> slam<00:02:46.210> into<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.510> heel<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.960> kind<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> go<00:02:47.320> in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
don't slam into a heel you kind of go in

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.410 
don't slam into a heel you kind of go in
a<00:02:47.500> gentle<00:02:47.980> curve<00:02:48.580> all<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.850> way<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.240> back

a gentle curve all the way to the back

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.300 
a gentle curve all the way to the back
and<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.870> kind<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.080> stops<00:02:50.410> very<00:02:50.650> easily<00:02:50.920> so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and it just kind of stops very easily so

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.070 
and it just kind of stops very easily so
there's<00:02:51.490> no<00:02:51.610> big<00:02:51.790> huge<00:02:52.180> flat<00:02:52.420> spot<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.840> slam

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
there's no big huge flat spot to slam

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.500 
there's no big huge flat spot to slam
into<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.340> super<00:02:54.580> arc<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:55.270> it's<00:02:55.360> not

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
into and it's not super arc but it's not

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.080 
into and it's not super arc but it's not
gigantic<00:02:56.170> flat<00:02:56.440> spot<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.340> you've

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
gigantic flat spot as you can see you've

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.880 
gigantic flat spot as you can see you've
got<00:02:58.120> pretty<00:02:58.810> classic<00:02:59.200> taper<00:02:59.410> towards<00:02:59.680> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
got pretty classic taper towards the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.410 
got pretty classic taper towards the
front<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.610> can<00:03:00.640> get<00:03:00.820> fairly<00:03:01.120> high<00:03:01.270> in

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
front and you can get fairly high in

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.760 
front and you can get fairly high in
stuff<00:03:01.660> where<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.930> start<00:03:02.170> hitting<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.410> tip<00:03:02.590> on

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
stuff where you start hitting the tip on

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.650 
stuff where you start hitting the tip on
this<00:03:02.950> thing<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:04.030> does<00:03:04.209> well<00:03:04.360> over

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
this thing so it does well over

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.390 
this thing so it does well over
ingredients<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.290> well<00:03:05.470> slightly<00:03:05.740> taller<00:03:06.070> ones

ingredients as well slightly taller ones

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.310 
ingredients as well slightly taller ones
it's<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.330> good<00:03:07.510> profile<00:03:07.959> on<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.140> knife

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
it's just a good profile on the knife

you<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> little<00:03:26.110> bit<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.380> sticking<00:03:26.800> with

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
you get a little bit of sticking with

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.680 
you get a little bit of sticking with
ingredients<00:03:27.550> on<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> side<00:03:28.150> because<00:03:28.360> it's<00:03:28.570> a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
ingredients on the side because it's a

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.020 
ingredients on the side because it's a
thin<00:03:28.930> blade<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.530> you've<00:03:30.310> got<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> fairly<00:03:30.730> flat

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
thin blade and you've got a fairly flat

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.240 
thin blade and you've got a fairly flat
side<00:03:31.360> there's<00:03:31.600> no<00:03:31.690> texture<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.440> but<00:03:33.010> it

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
side there's no texture to it but it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.890 
side there's no texture to it but it
drops<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.640> ingredients<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.269> well<00:03:34.420> not

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
drops the ingredients really well not

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.580 
drops the ingredients really well not
much<00:03:35.200> wedging<00:03:35.680> at<00:03:35.769> all<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:38.350> one

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
much wedging at all and this one

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.580 
much wedging at all and this one
compared<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.190> 210<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.300> 210<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.170> fair

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
compared to the 210 the 210 is a fair

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.660 
compared to the 210 the 210 is a fair
amount<00:03:41.680> thinner<00:03:42.100> than<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.459> especially

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
amount thinner than this especially

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.520 
amount thinner than this especially
towards<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.420> tip<00:03:43.690> even<00:03:44.050> though<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.350> is

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
towards the tip even though this is

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.680 
towards the tip even though this is
pretty<00:03:44.739> thin<00:03:44.950> at<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.190> tip<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:46.150> 210<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.660> a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
pretty thin at the tip and the 210 is a

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.720 
pretty thin at the tip and the 210 is a
bit<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.200> laser<00:03:47.440> style<00:03:47.890> but<00:03:48.130> it's<00:03:48.370> it's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
bit more of a laser style but it's it's

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.250 
bit more of a laser style but it's it's
very<00:03:48.820> much<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.300> little<00:03:49.450> brother<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.930> this<00:03:50.050> as

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
very much the little brother of this as

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.590 
very much the little brother of this as
far<00:03:50.410> as<00:03:50.530> shape<00:03:50.769> goes<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.430> behavior<00:03:52.180> it's<00:03:52.360> just

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
far as shape goes and behavior it's just

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.570 
far as shape goes and behavior it's just
a<00:03:52.690> little<00:03:52.900> bit<00:03:52.989> thinner<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.950> does<00:03:54.160> heavily

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
a little bit thinner and it does heavily

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.850 
a little bit thinner and it does heavily
more<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.910> laser<00:03:55.180> type<00:03:55.930> cutting<00:03:56.290> ability<00:03:56.500> to

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
more of a laser type cutting ability to

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.400 
more of a laser type cutting ability to
it<00:03:57.010> but<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.700> great<00:03:58.090> all-around<00:03:58.810> blade

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
it but this is a great all-around blade

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.080 
it but this is a great all-around blade
and<00:03:59.500> it's<00:03:59.650> got<00:03:59.830> good<00:04:00.070> performance<00:04:00.280> very<00:04:00.910> good

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
and it's got good performance very good

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.880 
and it's got good performance very good
performance<00:04:01.390> so<00:04:01.840> there<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.470> have<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.590> nicely

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
performance so there you have a nicely

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.030 
performance so there you have a nicely
