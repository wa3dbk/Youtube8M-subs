00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
information is pretty accurate I mean

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
information is pretty accurate I mean
it's<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.300> real<00:00:51.570> time<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.320> perfect

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it's not real time so it's not perfect

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
it's not real time so it's not perfect
but<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> most<00:00:53.460> part<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:54.180> pretty<00:00:54.420> damn

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
but for the most part it's pretty damn

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.410 
but for the most part it's pretty damn
accurate<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.370> start<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.640> off<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.120> look<00:00:57.329> at

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
accurate now to start it off you look at

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
accurate now to start it off you look at
the<00:00:57.539> list<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.989> stuff<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> green

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
checkmark equals good red x equals bad

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.700

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
now to this is updated not too long ago

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.590 
now to this is updated not too long ago
so<00:01:40.920> let's<00:01:41.130> say<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> 80<00:01:41.850> golda<00:01:42.180> stack<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.509> my

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so let's say it's a 80 golda stack of my

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630 
so let's say it's a 80 golda stack of my
auction<00:01:42.869> house<00:01:43.340> assuming<00:01:44.340> we're<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
auction house assuming we're going to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670 
auction house assuming we're going to
prospect<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.750> price<00:01:45.930> we're<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
prospect it at that price we're going to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
prospect it at that price we're going to
still<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.100> 96<00:01:47.640> gold<00:01:47.820> per<00:01:48.000> stack<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.869> what's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
still make 96 gold per stack so what's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.389 
still make 96 gold per stack so what's
cool<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.860> change<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
cool about this is you can change the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.100 
cool about this is you can change the
prices<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.930> example<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> gems<00:01:52.979> here

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
prices so for example with the gems here

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.359 
prices so for example with the gems here
tella<00:01:55.110> site<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
tella site is not going to go for a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.620 
hundred gold a stack are 100 gold each
that's<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.399> too<00:01:59.460> high<00:01:59.579> realistically<00:02:00.420> it's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that's way too high realistically it's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
that's way too high realistically it's
going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> go<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.110> poly<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.469> 35<00:02:01.890> gold<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
going to go for poly about 35 gold so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.160 
going to go for poly about 35 gold so
you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.880> switch<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.180> over<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> can

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.140 
that's half the gold it would cost a bot
off<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.780> auction<00:03:06.079> house<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.919> hit<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.849> it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
off the auction house so hit that and it

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.929 
off the auction house so hit that and it
doubled<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.599> profit<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.049> 126<00:03:09.829> cold<00:03:10.129> per<00:03:10.549> stack

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
doubled the profit to 126 cold per stack

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.110 
doubled the profit to 126 cold per stack
now<00:03:12.250> obviously<00:03:13.250> that's<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.609> way<00:03:13.729> to<00:03:13.790> go<00:03:13.970> if

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
now obviously that's the way to go if

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.819 
now obviously that's the way to go if
