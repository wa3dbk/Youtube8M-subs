removing the differential cover as you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.680 
removing the differential cover as you
can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.520> we've<00:00:47.700> got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> leak<00:00:48.450> going

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
can see we've got a bit of a leak going

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900 
can see we've got a bit of a leak going
on<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.500> we'll<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.250> able<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> replace<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
on here so we'll be able to replace the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.910 

and<00:03:10.300> what<00:03:10.420> I'm<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.170> tighten<00:03:11.650> all

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and what I'm going to do is tighten all

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.550 
and what I'm going to do is tighten all
of<00:03:12.100> these<00:03:13.410> finger<00:03:14.410> tight<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:16.350> then<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:17.470> going

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
of these finger tight and then I'm going

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.850 
of these finger tight and then I'm going
to<00:03:17.650> let<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.890> silicone<00:03:18.430> set<00:03:18.940> for<00:03:19.330> an<00:03:19.420> hour<00:03:19.860> to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
to let the silicone set for an hour to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.220 
to let the silicone set for an hour to
harden<00:03:21.280> before<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.700> come<00:03:21.940> down<00:03:22.150> come<00:03:22.720> back<00:03:22.750> and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
harden before I come down come back and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.010 
harden before I come down come back and
