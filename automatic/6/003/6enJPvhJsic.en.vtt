00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.970
 Dream comes true 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.810
 that the starting field and tens of thousands of motorsport fans are in great demand 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.839
 for the most recent meeting

 Hydrogen peroxide even though the asparagus has boxing 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.280
 Considering the ever growing number of professional teams in the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.480
 Completion big litter 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 is the racing series as usual and worldwide

 the importance of the Nürburgring with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.480
 Nordschleife 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 Last but not least, this woman has risen in motorsports 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.190
 and that after almost the same Recker Moores danger occupation highlight the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.020
 Embossed 24-hour race 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 it is hardly surprising 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.300
 That's the beginning of the season 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.120
 big goal to big name 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.780
 stand at the start 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 First and foremost, he does not need to lose much time like the factory crew 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.510
 Schmidt says 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 of the profit up to 24 hours 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.580
 if the prions Dirk Müller Augusto Farfus or as a notebook beamer the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.910
 Team around Trier have arrived on the first plate 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.510
 the starter number 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.780
 it gives wings to the first SMS victory at Biel in the 2010 season, too 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.030
 Team Black Falcon a rescuer a Mercedes with a pad strong 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.990
 Occupation equipped 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.780
 joined a whole armada of Porsche 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 the goodbye just on a tap of the tip 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
 Right 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.570
 but at the start 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.020
 Two violins followed by the mountain frowned on The first villages are still missing 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.959
 round 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.189
 behind it is positioned Oliver Kopitzke Tel WECHENSPIEGEL researcher in 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.999
 the shop of the Leipziger 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.159
 Hans was able to pass Astella on the Döttinger Höhe and 14 with it 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.649
 Band Haifa played in the leading group 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.649
 but Thomas Jäger was the Oberfeldwebel 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.879
 while she did that again and could do it a short time later 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.719
 because he was the first run 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.259
 as usual in the race 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.099
 yes the Romand has not yet when the start phase only three vehicles 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.319
 or Michael together so 15 vehicles and ten seconds 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.789
 and so the astronomers take relatively small farm and still all 7 20 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:56.589
 Clock says Volker Braig 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:01.619
 wait very very meanwhile meanwhile on the verge of madness in the evening but very 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:06.389
 In the end, long does not respond to his son and to Irma once the 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.729
 Things in the center 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.889
 the beamer first positioning for the north side summer 2011 the people 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.939
 always me 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.060
 it really does not work right now but it's 42 in first place and as usual 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.080
 here a value of the second place becomes stupid 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.849
 It is difficult but that was only really unclear until the second time 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 Dr high caliber would now be the first race 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.450
 the man captured consistently failed 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.299
 some fights 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.609
 this happens on the first run 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.649
 behind the top group 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:40.959
 the team vehicles 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.089
 belong to him 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.949

 Delius in Vienna with 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.039
 Zuber only vehicle occupied classes 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.149
 the first points 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.149
 the diversity 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.289
 so does the Ferrari 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:05.339
 how the American encryption financial investor started the war home 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.919
 develop 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.900
 The trend is still 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.900
 at least 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:14.649
 after riding the pit stops to keep the top spot short 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.049
 the children's home took its performance 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.049
 the first races use songs 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.129
 at the top 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.129
 flexible the bank depending on the pit stop windows 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.050
 BMW m3 DTM 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.050
 Mercedes STS is that good 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.889
 the otherwise to have on the Nordschleife 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.370
 Porsche could 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.860
 he wanted to run this race 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.349
 Top players call 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.430
 three quarters of an hour before the end 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.589
 In Halle, the ban has knowledge of the first forms in lab tests 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.939
 technical error 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.580
 just before the drop of the checkered flag had gang in front 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.580
 lying clearly again briefly to the pits 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.370
 safely 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.919
 thus, in fact, goes first part 1 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.919
 women-wm 2011 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.860
 At the same time, Augusto Farfus was able to come to terms with her 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.399
 Baby received in front of the sister vehicle with Georg Müller in the Prio and Prof 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.309
 behind it came the Mercedes SLS from treptow-köpenick 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.009
 Thomas Jäger's use there threw the round well 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.989
 Firstly, he successfully completed the barrick's vases 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:45.779
 not you with the Mercedes on the track 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.960
 yes it was a great race at the beginning there were many 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.660
 overtaking maneuver it was really exciting the start phase in between 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.699
 in the Langweider the Borscher also the mammoth turned out the mark 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.389
 with the SLS lite-on small problem around the department store chain is opposition front 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.979
 but ultimately not third and fourth place for our new 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.600
 Vehicle this year and I think that it is a very good start for the 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.770
 bundessport program and it's perfect will be zero zero 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.039
 Problems the car was well sorted out 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.099
 we got our job done quite well it will be done 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.220
 today was also beautiful to drive the tires to the end so zero 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.990
 problem 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.479
 and the problem was just because the competition was 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.249
 the percent has failed in rows 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.069
 But at least in the beginning we had a great race
