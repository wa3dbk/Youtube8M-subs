00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.610
 the industrial modeling has grown so much 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.380
 that even the show as american next 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.009
 topmodel will have its own version in 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.079
 our country 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.970
 the Peruvian top-model valderÃ­a de santis 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.980
 is responsible for selecting and guiding 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.470
 all the girls in the difficult world of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.450
 tell me how the idea was born and what 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.070
 do you think that generated the 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.989
 conditions for a program like 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.910
 this one can finally be on the street 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.290
 I think everything is changing in fashion 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.629
 in Peru not so much in the designers 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.640
 photographers because no models or by 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.070
 what not to become a brazil or a greater 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 that fashion and export models and give them 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.670
 the opportunity to travel 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.339
 and I always wanted to be a franchise 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.059
 we have all seen a great end of the 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.370
 that once 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.890
 this is what is going to make it change not 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 in Peru I believe the revolution you die 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 all the girls I found had 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.809
 right now we're in open casting and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.729
 Pucallpa girls have come from 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.280
 trujillo de cuco a veto 82 178 16 years 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.080
 you do not know the Peruvian beauty is that we are 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.119
 a mix, well, we do not love it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 the typical blonde blue eyes but the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.909
 exotic gorgeous that suddenly has 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.530
 a nose coughs big but it's 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.569
 wonderful one that is more brunette not 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.740
 forget the variety that we have is there 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.740
 there are the cute ones 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.880
 It's difficult because if you think 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.130
 is a career that is based on the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.630
 appearance and as I said before always 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.950
 there is a cuter one that you have to 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.080
 have a lot of security you have to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.090
 believe in you because there is no place 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.040
 for insecure in this race I do not like 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.660
 you know one not finally I know that you 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.610
 you have the super trained eye in all 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.410
 but how do you recognize that that girl has 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.810
 something special you understand me and without having 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.790
 recognized come out when I see her is photos 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.440
 that is, when I see you I do not see the touch 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.600
 I say a lot this girl has something 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.220
 is looking in universal terms and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.200
 worldwide because they see that you drive a 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.690

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.820
