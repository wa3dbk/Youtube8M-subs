wood bleach per gram of oxalic acid that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.609 
wood bleach per gram of oxalic acid that
tells<00:01:45.000> us<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.420> 120<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.259> point<00:01:46.500> eight

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
tells us we need 120 one point eight

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
tells us we need 120 one point eight
milliliters<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> wood<00:01:47.640> bleach<00:01:47.820> per<00:01:48.479> liter<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
milliliters of wood bleach per liter of

milliliters of wood bleach per liter of
solution<00:01:49.189> now<00:01:50.189> citric<00:01:50.670> acid<00:01:51.000> calculations

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
solution now citric acid calculations

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.300 
solution now citric acid calculations
much<00:01:51.750> easier<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.380> multiply<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> molar

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
much easier we just multiply the molar

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090 
much easier we just multiply the molar
mass<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.759> citric<00:01:54.060> acid<00:01:54.360> by<00:01:54.450> zero<00:01:54.750> point<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.100> so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
mass of citric acid by zero point one so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.410 
mass of citric acid by zero point one so
if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:57.000> liter<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
if you want to make a one liter of the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840 
if you want to make a one liter of the
solution<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.049> would<00:01:58.140> use<00:01:58.350> 122<00:01:59.219> milliliters

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
solution you would use 122 milliliters

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.749 
solution you would use 122 milliliters
of<00:01:59.880> wood<00:02:00.149> bleach<00:02:00.560> 19<00:02:01.560> grams<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.100> citric<00:02:02.430> acid

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
of wood bleach 19 grams of citric acid

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.760 
of wood bleach 19 grams of citric acid
and<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.030> add<00:02:03.270> water<00:02:03.509> until<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.229> reach<00:02:04.439> one

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then add water until you reach one

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 
and then add water until you reach one
liter<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.670> make<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> gallon<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.600> multiply

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
liter to make a gallon you just multiply

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
liter to make a gallon you just multiply
those<00:02:07.350> amounts<00:02:07.560> by<00:02:07.829> three<00:02:08.250> point<00:02:08.489> seven<00:02:08.789> eight

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
those amounts by three point seven eight

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.510 
those amounts by three point seven eight
one<00:02:09.690> final<00:02:10.110> note<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.160> wood<00:02:11.340> bleach

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
one final note is if your wood bleach

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550 
one final note is if your wood bleach
contains<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.239> ten<00:02:12.510> percent

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
contains more than ten percent

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
contains more than ten percent
gasps<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.130> some<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.400> them<00:02:14.489> contain<00:02:14.849> 95<00:02:15.450> to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
gasps that some of them contain 95 to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
gasps that some of them contain 95 to
100<00:02:16.020> percent<00:02:16.319> you're<00:02:16.890> gonna<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> change

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
100 percent you're gonna have to change

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.920 
100 percent you're gonna have to change
the<00:02:17.670> calculations<00:02:18.270> here<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.630> don't<00:02:18.780> put

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the calculations here so you don't put

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.520 
the calculations here so you don't put
too<00:02:19.110> much<00:02:19.190> into<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.310> mix
