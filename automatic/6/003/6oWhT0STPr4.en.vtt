aim<00:01:27.689> down<00:01:27.900> sights<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.530> shotgun<00:01:28.829> now

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
aim down sights with your shotgun now

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
aim down sights with your shotgun now
it's<00:01:29.790> usually<00:01:29.970> better<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> hipfire<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's usually better to hipfire but it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170 
it's usually better to hipfire but it
helps<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> one-shot<00:01:32.400> kills<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.909> get

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
helps with the one-shot kills if you get

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.789 
helps with the one-shot kills if you get
really<00:01:33.479> close<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.350> aim

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really close and then aim

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.260 
really close and then aim
since<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.310> easier<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> your

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
since it's easier to get all of your

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
since it's easier to get all of your
shots<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> target<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> s12<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
shots on target now because the s12 and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
shots on target now because the s12 and
m12<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.630> fast<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.079> shooting<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:41.070> sure

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
m12 are very fast at shooting make sure

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
m12 are very fast at shooting make sure
that<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.490> aim<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.030> only<00:01:42.360> tap<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> trigger

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that you aim and only tap the trigger

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
that you aim and only tap the trigger
because<00:01:43.619> by<00:01:43.950> doing<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> you'll<00:01:44.729> make<00:01:44.939> sure

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
because by doing this you'll make sure

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
because by doing this you'll make sure
that<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.299> only<00:01:45.570> use<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.869> shot<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that you only use one shot to get the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
that you only use one shot to get the
kill<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.220> don't<00:01:47.790> overdo<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
kill and don't overdo it and this is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.660 
kill and don't overdo it and this is
good<00:01:49.290> because<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.710> saves<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.159> ammo<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
good because it saves your ammo and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
good because it saves your ammo and
makes<00:01:51.270> getting<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> one-shot<00:01:51.990> kills<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.530> whole

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
makes getting the one-shot kills a whole

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
makes getting the one-shot kills a whole
'lord<00:01:53.250> easier<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:54.329> obviously<00:01:54.869> because

'lord easier now obviously because

with the rushing but also keep you off

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.610 
with the rushing but also keep you off
the<00:02:17.700> rear<00:02:17.910> door<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.750> after<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> few<00:02:19.110> games<00:02:19.500> of

the rear door so after a few games of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.200 
the rear door so after a few games of
playing<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.190> you'll<00:02:20.700> find<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.030> much

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
playing like this you'll find it much

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.360 
playing like this you'll find it much
easier<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.660> get<00:02:21.870> one<00:02:22.050> shot<00:02:22.230> kills<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.800> you'll

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
easier to get one shot kills and you'll

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.590 
easier to get one shot kills and you'll
be<00:02:23.460> able<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.880> challenge<00:02:24.210> done<00:02:24.390> much

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
be able to get that challenge done much

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.140 
be able to get that challenge done much
faster<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.860> sniper<00:02:26.310> rifles<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
faster now for the sniper rifles the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.850 
faster now for the sniper rifles the
one-shot<00:02:27.570> kills<00:02:27.840> are<00:02:27.990> not<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.320> hard<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> get

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
one-shot kills are not so hard to get

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
one-shot kills are not so hard to get
and<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.610> because<00:02:29.910> any<00:02:30.120> shot<00:02:30.420> above<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and this is because any shot above the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.750 
and this is because any shot above the
chest<00:02:31.050> usually<00:02:31.800> ends<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.100> as<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> one-shot<00:02:32.520> kill

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
chest usually ends up as a one-shot kill

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
chest usually ends up as a one-shot kill
but<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> find<00:02:34.080> yourself<00:02:34.470> not<00:02:34.650> getting

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
but if you find yourself not getting

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.740 
but if you find yourself not getting
enough<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.730> thing<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.030> really<00:02:36.300> helped<00:02:36.600> me

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
enough one thing that really helped me

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.260 
enough one thing that really helped me
out<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.560> use<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.800> ACOG<00:02:38.310> sight<00:02:38.580> now

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
out was to use the ACOG sight now

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.270 
out was to use the ACOG sight now
because<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.840> using<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.590> didn't<00:02:41.160> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
because I was using this I didn't have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.070 
because I was using this I didn't have
to<00:02:41.400> aim<00:02:41.550> down<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.880> full<00:02:42.090> scope<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.900> could

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
to aim down the full scope and I could

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.150 
to aim down the full scope and I could
use<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.320> more<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.710> an<00:02:43.800> assault<00:02:43.920> rifle

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
use it more like an assault rifle

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.130 
use it more like an assault rifle
instead<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.780> could<00:02:46.020> be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
instead and this is because I could be

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.840 
instead and this is because I could be
really<00:02:46.470> aggressive<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.070> much<00:02:47.370> stronger<00:02:47.610> in

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
really aggressive and much stronger in

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790 
really aggressive and much stronger in
close<00:02:48.090> quarters<00:02:48.480> gunfights<00:02:48.960> but<00:02:49.410> at<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> same

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
close quarters gunfights but at the same

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.920 
close quarters gunfights but at the same
time<00:02:50.130> still<00:02:50.640> be<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:51.150> effective<00:02:51.600> at<00:02:51.720> those

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
time still be really effective at those

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.080 
time still be really effective at those
long<00:02:52.230> range<00:02:52.530> kills<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.550> real<00:02:53.880> problem

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
long range kills now the real problem
