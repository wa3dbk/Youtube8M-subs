 pieces then the interest of cutting our 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 potatoes before cooking it's 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.030
 simply that suddenly they go

 can grow faster and you will see 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.449
 it will be much easier for 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.550
 crushing and then after that time 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.949
 we will take care of our onions so we 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 sees them slicing quite roughly and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 stove with olive oil we add 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.939
 then our parsley finely chopped for 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.640
 give color and taste on 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.409
 so add the tomato concentrate then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.210
 if we add tomato paste 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.830
 in our whole shepard it's 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 just because it's going to add some 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.920
 taste of meat and it's really going to 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 give a little tomato scent a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.630
 little air of provence 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.119
 then we season a little bit of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890

 if our potato barter 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.310
 nothing more simple we will simply 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.930

 we crush them and then add the milk 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.770
