talk about a very simple question but it

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.560

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.060 
would blow your mind how many people are
not<00:00:09.690> prepared<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.290> question<00:00:10.679> both<00:00:10.860> in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
not prepared for this question both in

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.740 
not prepared for this question both in
an<00:00:11.160> interview<00:00:11.460> setting<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.059> then<00:00:12.210> also<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
an interview setting and then also in a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.330 
an interview setting and then also in a
conversational<00:00:13.440> setting<00:00:13.799> should<00:00:14.009> they<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.219> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
conversational setting should they do a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340

ride-along or station visit and that's

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.340 
ride-along or station visit and that's
the<00:00:16.619> concept<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.250> why<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.510> want<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> be<00:00:19.320> a

firefighter and of course this could be

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.740 
firefighter and of course this could be

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
twisted why do you want to be an EMT why

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050
