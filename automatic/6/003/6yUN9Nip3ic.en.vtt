to say about this unique track the track

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380 
to say about this unique track the track
really<00:00:31.590> fits<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:32.369> p1<00:00:32.820> cars<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.270> know

really fits for these p1 cars you know
it's<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.750> formula<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.320> circuit<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
it's a formula one circuit and so it's a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.130 
it's a formula one circuit and so it's a
bill<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> latest<00:00:36.780> FIA<00:00:37.290> specification<00:00:38.160> and

one of these cars belongs there and so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
one of these cars belongs there and so
we<00:00:43.110> had<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.530> good<00:00:43.649> test<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.820> think
