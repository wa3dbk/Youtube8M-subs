00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 and so we are already in our studio and ready 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.200
 complete our investigation and we want 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 find out where does nitrates 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.670
 and where they are not there and in this will help us eco 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.150
 tester soeks 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.010
 there is a function to recognize 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.109
 radioactivity and there is a function here 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.150
 nitrate tester enable function 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 nitrate tester find the product we need 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:32.189
 put potatoes ok to our 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.130
 eco tester prepared for analysis first 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:42.239
 the product is taken from a large hypermarket 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:49.770
 well-known choice pokes 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:55.100
 measurement round is significant 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:59.430
 exceeding the norm the device is ready to poke 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.329
 This product you bought on the market will find out 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.329
 if it contains nitrates 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:13.310
 nitrate content is normal and now we take 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:19.310
 potato and store premium plan poke 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:23.290
 and by the way potatoes in the mage have a shop 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.290
 premium dirtiest seemed 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.750
 significant excess of the norm now we 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.540
 check 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.550
 vegetables and which are very beneficial for our 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.530
 children and for us of course which 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.240
 full and beta carotene in hope that they 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.390
 also not full nitrates the fact is that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.610
 We now have a carrot only and out of the market 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.880
 large hypermarket why because 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.910
 carrot in the premium store 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.390
 it turned out that it costs 500 rubles we decided 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.450
 that it is not rational to acquire it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.550
 for our test, something like this is not 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.470
 I want to be disappointed now because 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.479
 most often you buy a product and yet 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.570
 in a large hypermarket 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.570
 about 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:25.560
 Good nitrate sheath 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:25.560
 I reassured rather much tastier 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.480
 nitrate content is normal now we 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.730
 check beautiful and tasty apples 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 season is a must every morning 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.709
 eat apples and green apples they even 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.310
 helpful i just don't want to disappoint 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.319
 because I eat apples every day I 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.439
 I want to say right now that 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.900
 here we get these apples we 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.609
 clarified 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.209
 Are they grown in Russia and they told us 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:03.739
 what's up even though it says chili chili ska 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:07.010
 Russian apple dump in the pharmacy 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.819
 eat well as if the content of nitrates 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.699
 forms 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.780
 what really surprises me 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.569
 pretty apples that we 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 bought in the hypermarket 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.709
 nitrate content is normal but on the verge 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.719
 if there were 28 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.900
 and the rate of 60 is here 41 to beautiful 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:28.579
 content is 30 milligrams euro but let's get started 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 from the most unsightly tomato 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.180
 which we bought in the market content 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.150
 nitrates are normal 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.479
 take tomatoes that look like 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:48.709
 same unsightly if these tomatoes were worth 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:53.840
 40 rubles a kilogram of these we have 90 I and 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.709
 Knew exceeds and much there 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.910
 150 milligrams per kilogram and here 222 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.780
 last tomato 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.569
 He's from 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.000
 hypermarket norm nitrate content 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.920
 summarize the tomatoes that were 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.440
 bought in a premium store 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.070
 proved to be a significant excess 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.070
 nitrates
