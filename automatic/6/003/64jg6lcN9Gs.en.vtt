00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 I'll show you that I left the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.359
 fish marinating from one day to the next 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 for him to get salt a little taste of salt 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.340
 It's all good, it's all good. 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.850
 Look at me, you'll need one. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 Tablet of butter two onions 2 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.440
 coconut smell green pepper and salt 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.969
 to taste for those who do not know what the marina 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.199
 a temper that one day makes 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.059
 to the other, I'm going to get better 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.989
 I made a saucepan that lemon water salt and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.350
 garlic 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:07.130
 I put it in our fish already cleaned 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.070
 It's here, it's already open with commitment 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 and left it in this marinade. 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 that yesterday so for today to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.689
 people can make our fish 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 Now we're going to make a vinaigrette that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.909
 I 'm going to stuff the fish inside. It's good. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.470
 Come on, let's start now, Tomato. 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:39.600
 minced no seed is onion smell 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 green all taste tajra in a tequila 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.590
 Black pepper 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.189
 not many people garlic lemon juice 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.950
 not remembering that the one supposing a lemon only 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.939
 because in our fish I already left 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.719
 marinating with lemon and now we 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.670
 give a finishing touch as combines 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:09.420
 fish with coconut milk glass of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 coconut and a pinch of salt people 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.430
 Vinaigrette is not very good because I already 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.180
 I left the fish marinating so I 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:27.209
 for the vinaigrette of the one he 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.730
 temperadinho is our goldfish 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.440
 remembering before I left remember that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.650
 she's worth nothing I left the fish 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.379
 Well, I'm not going to bake any competitions. 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.349
 that runs right marinated whole 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.069
 You can fill all right giving a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.690
 look at the team the first thing to do is 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:54.209
 Butter, people have to be butter. 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.310
 because the margarine is not greasier 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.940
 it works is not good 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.410
