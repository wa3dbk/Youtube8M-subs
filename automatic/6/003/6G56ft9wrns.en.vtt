really with a lot of help from a lot of
people<00:00:18.960> our<00:00:19.619> idea<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.130> camp<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
people our idea for camp was to have a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.670 
people our idea for camp was to have a
time<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.580> retreat<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.140> immersion

into the tradition and music and we
started<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.890> had<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> idea<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.090> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
started and had the idea that if we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.589 
started and had the idea that if we
first<00:00:31.050> year<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> didn't<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:31.679> who

40<00:00:35.510> or<00:00:35.540> 50<00:00:35.870> people<00:00:36.079> there<00:00:36.260> we<00:00:36.680> would<00:00:36.920> call<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:38.000> a

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
40 or 50 people there we would call it a

the rock slide um it's just naturally
made<00:01:28.149> rock<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.960> apparently<00:01:29.770> like<00:01:30.220> fell<00:01:30.549> and

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
made rock that apparently like fell and

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.179 
made rock that apparently like fell and
it's<00:01:31.299> sort<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.630> slanted<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.409> water<00:01:32.619> runs<00:01:32.920> down

it's sort of slanted and water runs down

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.279 
it's sort of slanted and water runs down
it<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.579> sit<00:01:34.270> at<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.479> top<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:34.899> then<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.020> slide

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
it you sit at the top and then you slide

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.050 
it you sit at the top and then you slide
down<00:01:36.509> 50<00:01:37.509> years<00:01:37.720> ago<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.140> before<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.909> was

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
down 50 years ago and before it was

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.690 
down 50 years ago and before it was
common<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.899> have<00:01:41.140> one<00:01:41.590> week<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.130> two<00:01:42.250> weeks<00:01:42.280> in

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
common to have one week and two weeks in

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.419 
common to have one week and two weeks in
schools<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.409> way<00:01:44.590> people<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.369> think

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
schools and in that way people I think

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.999 
schools and in that way people I think
over<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.689> such<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.929> compact<00:01:47.470> period<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.829> time

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
over in such a compact period of time

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.419 
over in such a compact period of time
could<00:01:48.340> really<00:01:48.369> learn<00:01:48.819> a<00:01:48.849> lot<00:01:48.970> more<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:50.429> just

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
could really learn a lot more and just

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.520 
could really learn a lot more and just
really<00:01:51.880> begin<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.509> sort<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:52.929> big<00:01:53.319> more

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
really begin to sort of be big more

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.929 
really begin to sort of be big more
immersed<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.860> music<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.369> that's<00:01:54.549> just<00:01:54.789> not

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
immersed in music and that's just not

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.429 
immersed in music and that's just not
possible<00:01:55.209> in<00:01:55.539> today's<00:01:55.630> world

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
possible in today's world

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.830 
possible in today's world
so<00:01:56.830> our<00:01:56.979> answer<00:01:57.399> was<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:57.729> have<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.939> camp<00:01:58.299> to<00:01:58.630> try

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
so our answer was to have a camp to try

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.740 
so our answer was to have a camp to try
to<00:01:59.470> do<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.799> my<00:02:00.220> name<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.549> Nathan<00:02:00.909> Reese<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.420> I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
to do that my name is Nathan Reese and I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.109 
to do that my name is Nathan Reese and I
grew<00:02:02.319> up<00:02:02.349> in<00:02:02.590> Utah<00:02:02.740> my<00:02:03.520> parents<00:02:03.939> started

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
grew up in Utah my parents started

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.789 
grew up in Utah my parents started
singing<00:02:04.569> when<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.750> was<00:02:04.929> about<00:02:05.140> I'd<00:02:05.770> say

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
singing when I was about I'd say

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.130 
singing when I was about I'd say
nineteen<00:02:06.459> maybe<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.119> I've<00:02:07.750> been<00:02:07.899> singing
