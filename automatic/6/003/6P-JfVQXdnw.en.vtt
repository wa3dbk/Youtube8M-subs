 both categories we start with the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.990
 actions of the mx2 where they returned 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.080
 Jeffrey Herlings after his absence 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.950
 in the great prize of brasil here 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.640
 we had an inspired seremis yesterday with 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.860
 that suzuki bending inside 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.830
 beginning to battle for the tip 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.220
 the actions with the 'flying Dutchman' 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.500
 jeffrey herlings 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.610
 who was recovering from his injury to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 shoulders 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.060
 it was noticeable with a little lacking in rhythm 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.600
 but I was also going to leave everything as it is 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.770
 usual to take the victory to the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.740
 first sleeve 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.960
 great performance of team gassier what 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.570
 we saw with the 243 machine and there it is 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.690
 the pointer of the championship scored news and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.040
 I did not want to lose footprint nor is it a 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.720
 red dish as championship leader 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.270
 doing very good manga was going to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.780
 place in the second third placement 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.040
 was going to be gasquet in great performance 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.580
 victory of jeffrey herlings in the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.580
 first battery 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.960
 now we prepare for mx and peak in 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.120
 this first sleeve to the mattress 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.940
 corresponded to dripping polín in French 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.500
 that if it goes forward it will be steven 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.010
 frossard his teammate who gets 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.750
 fell when the second placement came 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.280
 unfortunately the Russian publisher what 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.460
 takes ahead and ended 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.640
 hospitalized the team driver 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.040

 is reached by Tony Cairoli 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.150
 that will outperform the two waves to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.420
 be placed in the fourth placement 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.579
 a very bad start by Tony Cairoli that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.090
 I had to come from behind 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.650
 who was looking yesterday to drip polín that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.829
 I was going to the victory of this first 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.900
 battery followed by clement to jump it 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:34.140
 I was going to be a horovitz fan in a great performance 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.140
 then nadal distracted and cairoli 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.829

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.680
 point of the race and we had the fight 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.670
