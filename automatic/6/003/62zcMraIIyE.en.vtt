00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
change the the modulation sound like if

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:27.779 
change the the modulation sound like if
it's<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:55.230> chorus<00:00:56.230> you<00:00:56.440> have<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.589> nice<00:00:58.860> flange<00:01:26.789> and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
you can take down the delay time so it's

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.310 
you can take down the delay time so it's
not<00:01:29.679> so<00:01:29.950> overpowering<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:31.929> for<00:01:32.140> straight

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320
