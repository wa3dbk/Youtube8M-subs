what the recent transparency other

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
things that have made me have a little

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.240 
things that have made me have a little
more<00:01:06.960> faith<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.220> are

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
more faith in them and that they are

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.789 
more faith in them and that they are
prioritizing<00:01:09.210> crucible<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> i

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
prioritizing crucible a bit more and i

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.990 
prioritizing crucible a bit more and i
think<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.130> even<00:01:11.220> though<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> may<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.580> launch

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
think that even though it may not launch

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870 
think that even though it may not launch
smooth<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.770> won't<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> long<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
smooth that it won't be that long of a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
smooth that it won't be that long of a
wait<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.420> around<00:01:15.540> until<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
wait this time around until they get it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
rifles the time is now so what do I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.690 
rifles the time is now so what do I
think<00:02:22.140> about<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.860> again<00:02:23.070> like<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.520> said<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
think about this and again like I said I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.430 
think about this and again like I said I
have<00:02:23.880> various<00:02:24.300> theories<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.900> support<00:02:25.260> this

a<00:02:34.080> sloppy<00:02:34.380> job<00:02:34.770> at<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.730> starters<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.300> this

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
a sloppy job at it for starters and this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.270 
a sloppy job at it for starters and this
is<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.780> basic<00:02:36.930> information<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> just

in<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.310> hand<00:03:32.519> cannon<00:03:32.850> category<00:03:33.239> because<00:03:33.420> it's

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
in the hand cannon category because it's

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.509 
in the hand cannon category because it's
got<00:03:33.810> already<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> pretty<00:03:34.620> solid<00:03:34.890> rate<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.310> fire

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
got already a pretty solid rate of fire

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.340 
got already a pretty solid rate of fire
at<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.760> high<00:03:35.910> damage<00:03:36.180> output<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.930> Hawkmoon

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
at a high damage output the Hawkmoon

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.500 
at a high damage output the Hawkmoon
really<00:03:37.739> needed<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.130> nerf<00:03:38.370> or<00:03:38.610> two<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.940> be<00:03:39.060> honest

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
really needed a nerf or two to be honest

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.300 
really needed a nerf or two to be honest
and<00:03:39.750> well<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.080> technically<00:03:40.500> didn't<00:03:40.920> get<00:03:41.070> one

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
and well it technically didn't get one

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.600 
and well it technically didn't get one
so<00:03:41.580> that's<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.940> scary<00:03:42.239> thought<00:03:42.739> next<00:03:43.739> up<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
so that's a scary thought next up the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.190 
so that's a scary thought next up the
pulse<00:03:44.850> rifles<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.510> don't<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:45.900> if<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.049> guys

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
pulse rifles I don't know if you guys

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.110 
pulse rifles I don't know if you guys
have<00:03:46.410> ever<00:03:46.530> experienced<00:03:47.370> some<00:03:47.580> things<00:03:47.820> but

as<00:03:54.600> they<00:03:54.930> are<00:03:55.080> now<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.560> how<00:03:55.680> they're<00:03:55.830> gonna

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
as they are now is how they're gonna

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
getting there for some fucked up reason

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.039 
getting there for some fucked up reason
seeing<00:04:02.880> as<00:04:02.940> how<00:04:03.060> they're<00:04:03.209> not<00:04:03.330> even<00:04:03.570> used<00:04:03.840> in

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
seeing as how they're not even used in

seeing as how they're not even used in
the<00:04:04.140> meta<00:04:04.290> right<00:04:04.470> now<00:04:04.590> people<00:04:04.830> don't<00:04:04.860> even

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
the meta right now people don't even

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.160 
the meta right now people don't even
equip<00:04:05.459> auto<00:04:05.670> rifles<00:04:06.090> anymore<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:06.900> yeah

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
equip auto rifles anymore so yeah

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.780

basically here we are at the corner of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
logic and deduction and looking right

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.820 
logic and deduction and looking right
through<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.880> window<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.600> spy<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.380> my<00:04:13.620> little

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
take the crown so that's what I see

another concern I have and this one
should<00:04:36.780> probably<00:04:37.380> be<00:04:37.590> very<00:04:38.069> curious<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.490> see

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
should probably be very curious to see

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.279 
should probably be very curious to see
how<00:04:38.819> it<00:04:38.970> plays<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.330> with<00:04:39.539> side<00:04:39.750> arms<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.080> other

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
how it plays in with side arms and other

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.290 
how it plays in with side arms and other
things<00:04:40.470> being<00:04:40.650> implemented<00:04:41.039> but<00:04:41.819> fusion

rifles<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.750> shotguns<00:04:42.780> are<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.410> so

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.740 
rifles and shotguns are so so
overwhelming<00:04:44.669> in<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:45.030> crucible<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.509> it<00:04:45.660> is

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
overwhelming in the crucible as it is

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.059 
overwhelming in the crucible as it is
already<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.199> because<00:04:46.470> they're<00:04:46.620> so<00:04:46.740> easy<00:04:46.919> to

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
already is because they're so easy to

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.770 
already is because they're so easy to
get<00:04:47.280> kills<00:04:47.520> with<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.060> they<00:04:48.509> don't<00:04:48.690> require

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
get kills with and they don't require

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.050 
get kills with and they don't require
you<00:04:49.229> know<00:04:49.319> passing<00:04:49.590> over<00:04:50.009> time<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.970> know

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
you know passing over time and you know

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.430 
you know passing over time and you know
precision<00:04:51.449> shots<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.840> just<00:04:51.870> aim<00:04:52.199> in<00:04:52.380> the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
precision shots you just aim in the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.260 
precision shots you just aim in the
general<00:04:52.740> direction<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.910> pull<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
general direction and you pull the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.350 
general direction and you pull the
trigger<00:04:54.539> so<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.590> catch<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.069> now<00:04:56.759> that<00:04:57.060> auto

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
trigger so the catch is now that auto

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.180 
trigger so the catch is now that auto
rifles<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.139> hand<00:04:58.349> cannons<00:04:58.680> are<00:04:58.830> generally

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
blink and other aspects of the game I

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.460 
blink and other aspects of the game I
feel<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.520> shotgun<00:05:12.030> in<00:05:12.330> fusion<00:05:12.630> rifle<00:05:12.990> use<00:05:13.259> is

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
feel that shotgun in fusion rifle use is

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.779 
feel that shotgun in fusion rifle use is
actually<00:05:13.620> going<00:05:14.039> to<00:05:14.190> go<00:05:14.310> up<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.550> feel<00:05:14.699> like

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
actually going to go up I feel like

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.969 
actually going to go up I feel like
blinking<00:05:15.270> shotguns<00:05:15.810> are<00:05:15.990> going<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.710> be<00:05:16.800> even

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
blinking shotguns are going to be even

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.589 
blinking shotguns are going to be even
harder<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.430> handle<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.880> know<00:05:17.970> before<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.360> had

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
harder to handle you know before I had

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.060 
harder to handle you know before I had
confidence<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:19.139> my<00:05:19.259> last<00:05:19.440> word<00:05:19.680> shutting<00:05:20.009> down

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
confidence in my last word shutting down

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.860 
confidence in my last word shutting down
a<00:05:20.130> shotgunner<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:20.880> sometimes<00:05:21.419> I<00:05:21.570> get<00:05:21.750> that

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
a shotgunner and sometimes I get that

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.149 
a shotgunner and sometimes I get that
many<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.199> times<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.560> know<00:05:22.650> he's<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:22.889> already

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
many of times you know he's just already

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.980 
many of times you know he's just already
on<00:05:23.310> my<00:05:23.430> face<00:05:23.669> but<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.090> do<00:05:24.150> have<00:05:24.419> any<00:05:24.539> distance

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
on my face but if I do have any distance

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.659 
on my face but if I do have any distance
there<00:05:25.530> is<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.710> little<00:05:26.099> bit<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.340> room<00:05:26.490> for

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
there is a little bit of room for

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.279 
there is a little bit of room for
confidence<00:05:27.090> there<00:05:27.240> now<00:05:27.449> with<00:05:27.960> these<00:05:28.110> guns

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
confidence there now with these guns

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.800 
confidence there now with these guns
being<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.860> little<00:05:29.069> bit<00:05:29.250> slower<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.789> kill<00:05:30.000> that's

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
being a little bit slower to kill that's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.659 
being a little bit slower to kill that's
a<00:05:30.990> scary<00:05:31.289> thought<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.860> feel<00:05:32.099> that<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.460> are

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
a scary thought I feel that you are

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.460 
a scary thought I feel that you are
going<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:32.940> have<00:05:33.090> less<00:05:33.330> chance<00:05:33.389> of<00:05:33.870> taking<00:05:34.199> out

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
going to have less chance of taking out

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.010 
going to have less chance of taking out
those<00:05:34.620> people<00:05:35.009> that<00:05:35.039> use<00:05:35.490> blink<00:05:36.270> shotguns<00:05:36.750> and

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
those people that use blink shotguns and

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.510 
those people that use blink shotguns and
that's<00:05:37.259> that's<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.710> big<00:05:37.889> concern<00:05:38.039> seeing<00:05:38.430> as

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
that's that's a big concern seeing as

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.680 
that's that's a big concern seeing as
how<00:05:38.610> that's<00:05:38.789> one<00:05:38.909> of<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.060> biggest<00:05:39.270> problems

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
how that's one of the biggest problems

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.180 
how that's one of the biggest problems
with<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:39.960> game<00:05:40.139> right<00:05:40.349> now<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:40.740> honestly

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
with the game right now and honestly

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.800 
with the game right now and honestly
they're<00:05:41.550> mentioning<00:05:41.789> how<00:05:42.479> they're<00:05:42.659> going<00:05:42.750> to

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
they're mentioning how they're going to

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.379 
they're mentioning how they're going to
blink<00:05:43.080> nerf<00:05:44.039> it<00:05:44.280> or<00:05:44.430> tweak<00:05:44.759> it<00:05:44.940> in<00:05:45.030> some<00:05:45.240> way

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
blink nerf it or tweak it in some way

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:46.790 
blink nerf it or tweak it in some way
but<00:05:45.449> the<00:05:45.690> fact<00:05:45.900> is<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.110> no<00:05:46.409> matter<00:05:46.469> what<00:05:46.740> you

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
but the fact is that no matter what you

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.399 
but the fact is that no matter what you
do<00:05:47.099> or<00:05:47.130> what<00:05:47.430> any<00:05:47.550> possible<00:05:48.509> outcome<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.199> I

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
do or what any possible outcome is I

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.170 
do or what any possible outcome is I
think<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:49.830> can<00:05:49.949> still<00:05:50.070> be<00:05:50.340> used<00:05:50.520> aggressively

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
think you can still be used aggressively

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.029 
think you can still be used aggressively
and<00:05:51.419> if<00:05:51.810> somebody<00:05:52.110> could<00:05:52.259> just<00:05:52.440> blink<00:05:52.680> into<00:05:53.009> a

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
and if somebody could just blink into a

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.760 
and if somebody could just blink into a
room<00:05:53.340> with<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.490> shotgun<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:54.680> pretty<00:05:55.680> much
