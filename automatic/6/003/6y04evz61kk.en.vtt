00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.370 
this thing hits you not all these shut
not<00:02:51.190> all<00:02:51.220> these<00:02:51.700> shots<00:02:52.060> are<00:02:52.330> headshots<00:02:53.460> but

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
not all these shots are headshots but

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.270 
not all these shots are headshots but
with<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.410> dummy<00:02:56.800> arrow<00:02:57.190> they<00:02:57.610> still<00:02:58.000> get<00:02:58.210> a<00:02:58.270> kill

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
with a dummy arrow they still get a kill

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.920 
with a dummy arrow they still get a kill
now<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.340> second<00:03:00.970> type<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.210> we<00:03:01.570> are<00:03:01.660> always

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
now the second type of we are always

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.520 
now the second type of we are always
going<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.320> asked<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.920> bolt<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:04.210> will<00:03:04.960> spot

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
going to be asked and bolt it will spot

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.750 
going to be asked and bolt it will spot
enemies<00:03:06.280> within<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.420> 10<00:03:07.690> meter<00:03:07.960> radius<00:03:08.760> much

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
enemies within a 10 meter radius much

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.800 
enemies within a 10 meter radius much
like<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> motion<00:03:10.690> sensor<00:03:10.930> I'd<00:03:11.290> imagine<00:03:12.810> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
like a motion sensor I'd imagine that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.570 
like a motion sensor I'd imagine that
thing<00:03:14.140> should<00:03:14.380> be<00:03:14.410> pretty<00:03:14.740> useful<00:03:15.100> for

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
thing should be pretty useful for

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.710 
thing should be pretty useful for
bottlenecks<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:17.820> since<00:03:18.820> it's<00:03:19.060> pretty<00:03:19.570> small

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
bottlenecks and since it's pretty small

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.350 
bottlenecks and since it's pretty small
it<00:03:20.650> should<00:03:20.830> be<00:03:20.860> hard<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.370> spot<00:03:21.490> for<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> enemy

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
it should be hard to spot for the enemy

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.150 
it should be hard to spot for the enemy
now<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.810> third<00:03:26.080> type<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.470> arrow<00:03:26.890> is

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
now the the third type of arrow is

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.010 
now the the third type of arrow is
called<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:28.120> balance<00:03:28.570> boat<00:03:30.270> trailer<00:03:31.270> says<00:03:31.690> it

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
called the balance boat trailer says it

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.970 
called the balance boat trailer says it
is<00:03:32.410> balanced<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:33.490> long-range<00:03:34.330> flight<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.770> I'd

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
is balanced for long-range flight so I'd

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.600 
is balanced for long-range flight so I'd
imagine<00:03:36.520> it<00:03:36.670> being<00:03:36.910> equivalent<00:03:37.360> for<00:03:38.140> a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
imagine it being equivalent for a

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.050 
imagine it being equivalent for a
crossbow<00:03:39.610> sniper<00:03:41.070> obviously<00:03:42.070> those<00:03:42.430> medium

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
crossbow sniper obviously those medium

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.500 
crossbow sniper obviously those medium
damage<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:45.370> want<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.790> go<00:03:45.970> for<00:03:46.210> headshots

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
damage so you want to go for headshots

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.100 
damage so you want to go for headshots
whenever<00:03:47.290> possible<00:03:48.270> now<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.330> fourth<00:03:49.900> and

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
whenever possible now the fourth and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.200 
whenever possible now the fourth and
final<00:03:50.170> type<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:51.040> arrow<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.640> one<00:03:52.030> I'm

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
final type of arrow is the one I'm

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.200 
final type of arrow is the one I'm
looking<00:03:52.390> toward<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.930> most<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.880> high

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
looking toward the most it is the high

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.390 
looking toward the most it is the high
explosive<00:03:56.020> boat<00:03:56.790> which<00:03:57.790> deals<00:03:58.270> high<00:03:58.630> damage

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
explosive boat which deals high damage

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.890 
explosive boat which deals high damage
within<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.790> small<00:04:01.390> splash<00:04:01.870> radius<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
within a small splash radius and is the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.960 
within a small splash radius and is the
as<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.590> trailer<00:04:06.870> shows<00:04:08.280> people<00:04:09.280> will<00:04:09.670> find

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
as the trailer shows people will find

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.260 
as the trailer shows people will find
some<00:04:10.330> pretty<00:04:10.570> interesting<00:04:11.020> uses<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:12.010> it

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
some pretty interesting uses for it

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.630 
some pretty interesting uses for it
namely<00:04:13.270> taking<00:04:13.720> out<00:04:13.900> those<00:04:14.140> pesky<00:04:14.640> little

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
namely taking out those pesky little

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
namely taking out those pesky little
birds<00:04:16.060> making<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.750> low<00:04:16.959> pass<00:04:18.150> head<00:04:19.150> shot<00:04:19.480> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
birds making a low pass head shot the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.200 
birds making a low pass head shot the
pilot<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.380> watch<00:04:20.770> the<00:04:20.979> helicopter<00:04:21.700> interior

pilot and watch the helicopter interior

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.530 
pilot and watch the helicopter interior
turn<00:04:22.570> turn<00:04:23.320> into<00:04:23.650> red<00:04:23.830> soup<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:25.180> should<00:04:25.419> be

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
turn turn into red soup that should be

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.420 
turn turn into red soup that should be
pretty<00:04:25.690> fun

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430
