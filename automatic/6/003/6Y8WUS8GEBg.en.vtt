 hello to all the kids today I bring you 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.840
 a new chapter of equipment by the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.600
 world in this case as you will see now 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.130
 same are going to be Uruguayan a template 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.600
 one of my favorites and that never 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.000
 I will sell below I will leave you the link of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.060
 futsal the truth I would not have to like 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.009
 very much and it's not expensive, we started the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.009
 first match of this cup as you see a 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.599
 bundesliga team I think that uncle 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.090
 he liked a lot central and that's why he has 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.060
 those two forwards so big the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.980
 it's true that I did not have I do not know I did not like it 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.570
 much the team from the first moment 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.850
 that I experienced it that was quite easy and 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.490
 as you can see in minute 5 abel 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.380
 HernÃ¡ndez demonstrates her quality as 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.060
 I have already said in previous videos there is a 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.710
 video just for the one who is once 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.630
 this player you will see in this video 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.370
 is that looking at how he stands out is very 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.320
 good in minute 5 has already scored a goal and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.660
 was going to be the 8th minute and will you know if 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.310
 you are going to see his second goal a beast the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.110
 uncle throws good quality you'll be fine in 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.780
 power runs a lot is high the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.030
 mind head a player pass like 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.310
 you see what I like most about this 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.250
 team is like how it comes out of the plays 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.680
 dangerous and ends up being a goal to please 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.690
 our to a goal that could have been 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.640
 ends up being ours the truth is that 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 is a team or is another goal by abel 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.700
 hernandez the uncle is that minute 27 already 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.990
 had tailor a true pass and not 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 he was going to stay there we were going to stay there 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.520
 because in the 39th minute I was going to make another 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.560
 golazo the uncle do not see how it is clear 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.720
 is that for the less than a thousand coins that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.030
 is worth the uncle is a pass is a sure 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.790
 before, is that I already say it is high 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.940
 good shot speed has it all but 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.670
 well I was already measuring custard 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.100
 the uncle was watching him in a play of 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.899
 goal in his favor that he was sure of 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.899
 that was going to be his goal voltio 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 and unexpectedly pull the cable in the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.539
 micro 55 to enter goals of strip the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 good cable to me the truth gives me more or 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.579
 less like I got 40 the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.280
 custard were already given and good only 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.019
 was to wait for the uncle to 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.090
 decided to throw or was to wait for the 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.330
 match will end as you can see the first 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.760
 game 40 match very easy ya os what 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.790
 I say and good the truth that gave me courage 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.830
 to continue with the series and say let's 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's play there to see if you can 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.920
 win and make a video for these people 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.260
 it's been so long since we're nothing 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.910
 as you see the second team I liked it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.440
 go ahead but I did not like anything back it's 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.870
 a team that does not have laterals almost 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.220
 what he has is level but in the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.079
 game are not worth anything because they are very 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.930
 slow the goalkeeper the goalkeeper is a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.630
 porterazo and the very fast forward the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.790
 I was really scared, but you'll see 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.340
 how was the match with minute 4 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.510
 I have the first chute which 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.400
 urretavizcaya centra goalie clears 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.400
 Cavani takes her a few cuts ago 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.800
 the ball goes to another side tries 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.020
 of hernandez but can not get it 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.980
 and from there comes a corner which center 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.990
 of organ and point victorino puts the 1 0 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.030
 minute 7 the truth very early goal 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.540
 that I like me 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.950
 and as of minute 9 another play the truth 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.750
 It is that it is a great team look how 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.069
 the strikers unmarked that does not usually 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.180
 spend with many teams and when I 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.290
 happens the truth is that I like it 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.150
 alfaro fails 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 I think it fails because I was wrong not 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.300
 would have become quality if 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.120
 thrown power surely would have 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.520
 entered but well that can not be known 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.910
 until you do not do it as you see alpha 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.000
 reason pass to hernandez which central 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.810
 minute 45 and pum cavani gets to put the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.330
 2-0 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.310
 sure ahead cavani I love this 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.800
 player I love being ahead of 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.560
 Luz Suarez Cavani is much better because 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.840
 I 'll tell you a lot why because he has so much 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.410
 attack as defense and it comes very well already 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.380
 that helps a lot defensives back and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.150
 I like that because when it's back 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.010
 rushed and low the truth is that supports 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.239
 very much and have it in mid-center 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.700
 offensive you will always have it there 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.100
 above also as they see how it goes 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.250
 he hits fiscal urethras if I do not 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.870
 equivoco abel hernandez alfaro and in the 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970
 hooks prepare short and look as it says 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.790
 to the goalkeeper of the measured with this one 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.550
 and the truth that I liked a lot 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.530
 the truth a match 30 other custard the 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.750
 true to 2 matias in a row I felt very 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.150
 very very very comfortable with this team and 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.030
 Well this has been the result of 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.550
 semifinals I hope you liked it 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.490
 you know if you want to see how this ended 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.740
 team the tournament did manage to win it or 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.260
 if you did not get it you know you have to 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.700
 like this video and when it reaches 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.250
 75 I will upload the second part without wishing 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.130
 luck to the team there is no other left 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.290
 I say this team is going very very very very well 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.620
 I recommend you look at the link 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.960
 work works that I will leave 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.139
 and I'm just saying, I 'm just saying that you try it 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.330
 try not cost us anything I do not know if they are 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.830
 less than 50,000 insurance and you will see what 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.449
 well that yields this equipment is that it is very 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.800
 similar to Chileans at the time 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.320
 who says to me because I'm very similar 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.199
 even better this has been all kids 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.010
 I hope you liked what I said 75 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:19.449
 likes and you have the next video and up 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.449
