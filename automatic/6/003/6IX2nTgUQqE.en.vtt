Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and<00:00:06.950> today<00:00:07.880> I'm<00:00:07.970> talking<00:00:08.029> about<00:00:08.360> Ikea<00:00:08.840> BOTS

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
and today I'm talking about Ikea BOTS

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.520 
and today I'm talking about Ikea BOTS
which<00:00:09.320> is<00:00:09.500> a<00:00:09.530> multi<00:00:09.950> robot<00:00:10.370> autonomous

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
which is a multi robot autonomous

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.070 
which is a multi robot autonomous
furniture<00:00:12.530> assembly<00:00:12.920> system<00:00:13.630> the<00:00:14.630> system

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
furniture assembly system the system

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.890 
furniture assembly system the system
starts<00:00:15.800> from<00:00:15.889> a<00:00:16.309> set<00:00:17.029> of<00:00:17.150> CAD<00:00:17.360> files<00:00:17.630> that

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
starts from a set of CAD files that

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.420 
starts from a set of CAD files that
describe<00:00:18.200> the<00:00:18.320> individual<00:00:18.860> components<00:00:19.340> of

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
describe the individual components of

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.700 
describe the individual components of
the<00:00:19.550> system<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.540> part<00:00:21.290> that<00:00:21.470> you<00:00:21.529> want<00:00:21.649> to

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
the system of the part that you want to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.019 
the system of the part that you want to
assemble<00:00:22.040> so<00:00:22.220> for<00:00:22.369> example<00:00:22.700> we're<00:00:22.820> assembling

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
assemble so for example we're assembling

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.679 
assemble so for example we're assembling
the<00:00:23.270> lac<00:00:23.419> table<00:00:24.009> in<00:00:25.009> the<00:00:25.820> CAD<00:00:26.029> file<00:00:26.239> says<00:00:26.540> that

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
the lac table in the CAD file says that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.999 
the lac table in the CAD file says that
there's<00:00:26.840> four<00:00:27.020> table<00:00:27.320> legs<00:00:27.470> each<00:00:27.649> one<00:00:27.829> has<00:00:27.980> a

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
there's four table legs each one has a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.010 
there's four table legs each one has a
hole<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:28.730> there's<00:00:29.000> one<00:00:29.180> tabletop<00:00:29.660> which<00:00:29.869> has

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
hole and there's one tabletop which has

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.990 
hole and there's one tabletop which has
four<00:00:30.230> holes<00:00:30.380> in<00:00:30.559> it<00:00:30.680> and<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.520> system<00:00:31.849> goes

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
four holes in it and the system goes

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.450 
four holes in it and the system goes
from<00:00:32.029> that<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.390> infer<00:00:32.899> that<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.380> holes<00:00:34.160> in<00:00:34.370> the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
from that to infer that the holes in the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.889 
from that to infer that the holes in the
legs<00:00:34.670> match<00:00:35.059> up<00:00:35.269> with<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.510> holes<00:00:35.690> in<00:00:35.809> the

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
legs match up with the holes in the

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.779 
legs match up with the holes in the
parts<00:00:36.170> from<00:00:37.070> there<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:37.309> moves<00:00:37.489> on<00:00:37.640> to

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
parts from there it moves on to

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.610 
parts from there it moves on to
construct<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.329> symbolic<00:00:38.629> plan<00:00:38.989> which

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
construct a symbolic plan which

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.950 
construct a symbolic plan which
describes<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.129> order<00:00:40.399> in<00:00:40.519> which<00:00:40.550> these<00:00:40.850> are

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
describes the order in which these are

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.599 
describes the order in which these are
attached<00:00:41.960> together<00:00:42.170> we've<00:00:43.010> devised<00:00:43.309> our<00:00:43.489> own

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
attached together we've devised our own

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.669 
attached together we've devised our own
symbolic<00:00:44.210> planning<00:00:44.510> language<00:00:44.809> called<00:00:45.109> a<00:00:45.260> BPL

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
symbolic planning language called a BPL

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.889 
symbolic planning language called a BPL
which<00:00:46.609> is<00:00:46.760> an<00:00:46.850> object-oriented<00:00:47.390> sim<00:00:47.749> bog

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
which is an object-oriented sim bog

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.439 
which is an object-oriented sim bog
planning<00:00:48.260> language<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:49.820> has<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.089> notion<00:00:50.359> of

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
planning language it has the notion of

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.000 
planning language it has the notion of
groups<00:00:50.749> so<00:00:51.019> you<00:00:51.050> can<00:00:51.289> say<00:00:51.469> that<00:00:51.649> there's<00:00:51.829> four

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
groups so you can say that there's four

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.349 
groups so you can say that there's four
identical<00:00:52.460> table<00:00:52.879> legs<00:00:53.030> which<00:00:53.239> are

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
identical table legs which are

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.130 
identical table legs which are
interchangeable<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:55.640> actually

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
interchangeable and this actually

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.119 
interchangeable and this actually
expedites<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.230> planning<00:00:57.530> process<00:00:57.859> quite<00:00:58.070> a

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
expedites the planning process quite a

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.459 
expedites the planning process quite a
bit<00:01:01.120> that's<00:01:02.120> right<00:01:02.269> words<00:01:02.480> we're<00:01:03.079> just<00:01:03.350> like

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
bit that's right words we're just like

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.899 
bit that's right words we're just like
many<00:01:03.649> Americans<00:01:04.100> would<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.370> we<00:01:04.519> throw<00:01:04.760> out

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
many Americans would do we throw out

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.880 
many Americans would do we throw out
that<00:01:05.059> instruction<00:01:05.659> book<00:01:05.840> because<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:06.680> can't

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
that instruction book because we can't

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.230 
that instruction book because we can't
read<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:07.460> case<00:01:07.640> it's<00:01:07.909> entirely

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
read it in this case it's entirely

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240 
read it in this case it's entirely
pictorial<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:09.649> haven't<00:01:09.860> quite<00:01:09.920> solved

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
pictorial and we haven't quite solved

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.429 
pictorial and we haven't quite solved
that<00:01:10.369> computer<00:01:10.700> vision<00:01:10.909> problem<00:01:11.240> yet<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:11.659> we

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
that computer vision problem yet so we

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.200 
that computer vision problem yet so we
decided<00:01:12.770> it's<00:01:12.979> actually<00:01:13.280> easier<00:01:13.579> to<00:01:13.640> go<00:01:13.939> from

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
decided it's actually easier to go from

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.960 
decided it's actually easier to go from
the<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.630> individual<00:01:15.140> pen<00:01:15.619> files<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.640> fact<00:01:16.850> we

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
the the individual pen files in fact we

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.969 
the the individual pen files in fact we
don't<00:01:17.060> even<00:01:17.180> give<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.930> goal<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.530> what<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
don't even give it the goal of what the

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.490 
don't even give it the goal of what the
assembled<00:01:19.700> kit<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.750> supposed<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.110> look<00:01:21.259> like

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
assembled kit is supposed to look like

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.740 
assembled kit is supposed to look like
it<00:01:21.680> figures<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.070> out<00:01:22.159> for<00:01:22.310> itself<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.659> it

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
it figures that out for itself and it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.120 
it figures that out for itself and it
turns<00:01:23.930> out<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.380> case<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.770> lot<00:01:24.979> of

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
turns out that in the case of a lot of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.730 
turns out that in the case of a lot of
IKEA<00:01:25.460> kits<00:01:25.850> there's<00:01:26.119> only<00:01:26.270> one<00:01:26.570> unique<00:01:27.290> final

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
IKEA kits there's only one unique final

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.609 
IKEA kits there's only one unique final
configuration<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.880> works<00:01:29.619> so

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
configuration that that works so

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.740 
configuration that that works so
sometimes<00:01:31.460> there's<00:01:31.670> sort<00:01:31.850> say<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.090> left<00:01:32.570> and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
sometimes there's sort say a left and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.410 
sometimes there's sort say a left and
right<00:01:32.810> handed<00:01:33.200> desk<00:01:33.820> but<00:01:34.820> that's<00:01:35.000> usually<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
right handed desk but that's usually the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.260 
right handed desk but that's usually the
limit<00:01:35.719> of<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.869> ambiguity<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:38.000> it's<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.180> good

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
limit of the ambiguity so it's a good

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.230 
limit of the ambiguity so it's a good
thing<00:01:38.329> about<00:01:38.570> IKEA<00:01:38.930> for<00:01:39.350> our<00:01:39.710> purposes<00:01:40.240> so

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
thing about IKEA for our purposes so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.279 
thing about IKEA for our purposes so
once<00:01:41.570> we've<00:01:41.750> figured<00:01:41.930> out<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.820> assembly

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
once we've figured out the assembly

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.139 
once we've figured out the assembly
sequence<00:01:45.289> then<00:01:46.100> we<00:01:46.219> need<00:01:46.369> actually<00:01:46.700> execute

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
sequence then we need actually execute

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.800 
sequence then we need actually execute
to<00:01:47.359> build<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:48.700> kit<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.450> done<00:01:50.600> using

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
to build this kit and this is done using

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.069 
to build this kit and this is done using
multiple<00:01:51.590> robots<00:01:51.820> they<00:01:52.820> divided<00:01:53.450> up<00:01:53.600> based<00:01:53.750> on

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
multiple robots they divided up based on

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.889 
multiple robots they divided up based on
capabilities<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.670> some<00:01:56.030> robots<00:01:56.329> are<00:01:56.539> able<00:01:56.630> to

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
capabilities so some robots are able to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.899 
capabilities so some robots are able to
do<00:01:57.020> delivery<00:01:57.380> they<00:01:58.159> know<00:01:58.280> where<00:01:58.460> part<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:58.880> be

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
do delivery they know where part can be

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.639 
do delivery they know where part can be
found<00:01:59.179> so<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.479> can<00:01:59.659> imagine<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.140> factories

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
found so you can imagine in factories

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.020 
found so you can imagine in factories
sort<00:02:00.829> of<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.950> perched<00:02:01.189> feeder<00:02:01.429> that<00:02:01.789> kind<00:02:01.969> of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
sort of a perched feeder that kind of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.889 
sort of a perched feeder that kind of
thing

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
thing

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.539 
thing
and<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:03.320> separately<00:02:03.530> from<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.890> we<00:02:04.399> also

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
and then separately from that we also

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.160 
and then separately from that we also
have<00:02:04.880> assembly<00:02:05.329> robots<00:02:05.630> which<00:02:05.840> know<00:02:06.049> the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
have assembly robots which know the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.469 
have assembly robots which know the
blueprint<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.740> they<00:02:07.189> know<00:02:07.340> how<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.000> assemble

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
blueprint and they know how to assemble

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.270 
blueprint and they know how to assemble
things

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:03:09.059 

you

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.620 

so<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.239> have<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.689> the<00:03:10.959> case<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.349> lock<00:03:11.500> table

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
so we have in the case of the lock table

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.370 
so we have in the case of the lock table
screwing<00:03:13.230> device<00:03:13.820> which<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.240> can<00:03:15.810> show<00:03:16.320> you

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
screwing device which I can show you

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.690 
screwing device which I can show you
briefly<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.960> looks<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.640> you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
briefly so it looks like this and you

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.370 
briefly so it looks like this and you
can<00:03:21.000> see<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.780> pair<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.170> rings

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
can see it's like a pair of rings

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.010 
can see it's like a pair of rings
coupled<00:03:22.830> together<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.660> they're<00:03:24.660> they're

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
coupled together and they're they're

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.960 
coupled together and they're they're
coupled<00:03:25.200> using<00:03:26.130> these<00:03:26.250> rubber<00:03:26.490> bands<00:03:26.820> which

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
coupled using these rubber bands which

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.820 
coupled using these rubber bands which
gives<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.300> natural<00:03:27.420> compliance<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.680> that

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
gives you a natural compliance so that

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.530 
gives you a natural compliance so that
you<00:03:28.920> can<00:03:29.100> screw<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.580> unscrew<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.970> variety<00:03:30.510> of

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
you can screw and unscrew a variety of

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.770 
you can screw and unscrew a variety of
different<00:03:30.720> shapes<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.230> sizes<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.950> objects

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.110 

yeah<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.290> certain<00:03:37.710> extent<00:03:38.010> yeah<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> haven't

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
yeah to a certain extent yeah I haven't

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.570 
yeah to a certain extent yeah I haven't
tried<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.390> wineglass<00:03:39.750> yet<00:03:40.020> I<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.950> don't<00:03:41.310> see<00:03:41.460> why

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
tried a wineglass yet I I don't see why

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.690 
tried a wineglass yet I I don't see why
it<00:03:41.640> wouldn't<00:03:41.820> work<00:03:41.940> with<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.300> but<00:03:43.550> we<00:03:44.550> could

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
it wouldn't work with that but we could

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.260 
it wouldn't work with that but we could
do<00:03:44.820> your<00:03:44.940> light<00:03:45.090> bulb<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:48.090> basically

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
do your light bulb so the it's basically

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.790 
do your light bulb so the it's basically
it's<00:03:49.080> based<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:51.050> how<00:03:52.050> tight<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.590> rubber

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
it's based on the how tight the rubber

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's based on the how tight the rubber
band<00:03:53.010> zone<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.640> also<00:03:54.300> on<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.990> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
band zone and also on the on the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.480 
band zone and also on the on the
backside<00:03:55.530> we<00:03:55.680> had<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:55.800> little<00:03:56.010> bit<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.220> friction

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
backside we had a little bit of friction

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.780 
backside we had a little bit of friction
in<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:56.940> ring<00:03:57.180> here<00:03:57.390> using<00:03:57.690> magnets<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
in this ring here using magnets so the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.250 
in this ring here using magnets so the
stronger<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.180> magnets<00:04:00.480> are<00:04:00.600> obviously<00:04:00.990> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
stronger the magnets are obviously the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.610 
stronger the magnets are obviously the
the<00:04:01.500> tighter<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.040> grip<00:04:02.070> is<00:04:02.370> going<00:04:02.490> to<00:04:02.640> be

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.430 

so<00:04:09.280> yeah<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.640> actually<00:04:11.150> will<00:04:11.330> fit<00:04:11.440> right

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
so yeah so this actually will fit right

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.740 
so yeah so this actually will fit right
on<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.800> gripper<00:04:13.129> on<00:04:14.060> our<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.360> BOTS<00:04:14.569> at

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
on to the gripper on our you BOTS at

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.599 
on to the gripper on our you BOTS at
home<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.170> then<00:04:15.709> when<00:04:15.830> it's<00:04:15.980> not<00:04:16.130> using<00:04:16.489> it

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
home and then when it's not using it

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.699 
home and then when it's not using it
there's<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.850> dock<00:04:17.150> that<00:04:17.419> goes<00:04:17.690> on<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.959> front<00:04:18.169> so

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
there's a dock that goes on the front so

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.379 
there's a dock that goes on the front so
it<00:04:18.949> can<00:04:19.220> actually<00:04:19.400> put<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:19.820> away<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.060> then

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
it can actually put it away and then

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.060 
it can actually put it away and then
slip<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.840> on<00:04:20.930> like<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.139> glove<00:04:21.350> when<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.769> wants<00:04:21.979> to

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
slip it on like a glove when it wants to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.510 
slip it on like a glove when it wants to
use<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.720> when<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.810> wants<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.110> use<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.410> tool<00:04:27.520> so

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
use the when it wants to use the tool so

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.159 
use the when it wants to use the tool so
they<00:04:28.669> assemble<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.120> table<00:04:29.479> in<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.690> team

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
they assemble the table in a team

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.110 
they assemble the table in a team
fashion<00:04:30.680> if<00:04:31.100> there's<00:04:31.340> multiple<00:04:31.520> assembly

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
fashion if there's multiple assembly

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.030 
fashion if there's multiple assembly
robots<00:04:32.449> they'll<00:04:32.660> actually<00:04:32.919> partition<00:04:33.919> the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
robots they'll actually partition the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.490 
robots they'll actually partition the
work<00:04:34.190> amongst<00:04:34.639> themselves<00:04:34.820> or<00:04:35.300> for<00:04:36.290> greater

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
work amongst themselves or for greater

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.700 
work amongst themselves or for greater
parallelism<00:04:36.979> so<00:04:37.960> they<00:04:38.960> assemble<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.380> table

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
parallelism so they assemble the table

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.870 
parallelism so they assemble the table
and<00:04:40.010> then<00:04:40.100> when<00:04:40.250> they're<00:04:40.370> done<00:04:40.460> they<00:04:40.520> actually

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
and then when they're done they actually

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.240 
and then when they're done they actually
flip<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.210> over<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:42.050> this<00:04:42.470> involves<00:04:42.919> tight

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
flip it over so this involves tight

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.730 
flip it over so this involves tight
coordination<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.720> master<00:04:45.110> robot<00:04:45.440> which<00:04:45.620> is

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
coordination the master robot which is

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.710 
coordination the master robot which is
the<00:04:45.860> assembly<00:04:46.190> robot<00:04:46.340> tasks<00:04:47.060> with<00:04:47.300> doing<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
the assembly robot tasks with doing the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.810 
the assembly robot tasks with doing the
flipping<00:04:48.050> has<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.740> recruit<00:04:49.070> an<00:04:49.250> assistant

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
flipping has to recruit an assistant

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:05.859 

that's<00:06:04.819> basically<00:06:05.179> the<00:06:05.389> system<00:06:05.539> in<00:06:05.779> a

that's basically the system in a
nutshell<00:06:06.049> there's<00:06:06.469> a<00:06:06.529> lot<00:06:06.679> of<00:06:06.829> extensions

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
nutshell there's a lot of extensions

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.359 
nutshell there's a lot of extensions
that<00:06:07.909> we're<00:06:08.059> exploring<00:06:08.559> right<00:06:09.559> now<00:06:09.619> involving

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:10.369 
that we're exploring right now involving

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.059 
that we're exploring right now involving
incorporating<00:06:11.179> humans<00:06:11.539> so<00:06:12.349> you<00:06:12.589> know<00:06:12.649> humans

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
incorporating humans so you know humans

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.129 
incorporating humans so you know humans
that<00:06:13.219> just<00:06:13.429> want<00:06:13.579> to<00:06:13.699> help<00:06:13.909> on<00:06:14.449> their<00:06:14.599> own<00:06:14.749> or

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
that just want to help on their own or

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.499 
that just want to help on their own or
sometimes<00:06:15.529> you<00:06:15.769> need<00:06:15.859> to<00:06:15.919> ask<00:06:16.099> for<00:06:16.279> help<00:06:16.509> if

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
sometimes you need to ask for help if

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.409 
sometimes you need to ask for help if
something<00:06:17.839> goes<00:06:17.959> wrong<00:06:18.459> we're<00:06:19.459> exploring<00:06:19.819> how

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
something goes wrong we're exploring how

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:21.909 
something goes wrong we're exploring how
can<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.689> robot<00:06:20.809> formulate<00:06:21.439> a<00:06:21.469> natural

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
can the robot formulate a natural

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.979 
can the robot formulate a natural
language<00:06:22.069> request<00:06:22.639> for<00:06:22.879> help<00:06:23.059> that<00:06:23.509> a<00:06:23.569> human

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:23.989 
language request for help that a human

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:27.189 
language request for help that a human
can<00:06:24.619> then<00:06:25.239> intervene<00:06:26.239> briefly<00:06:26.569> just<00:06:26.869> to<00:06:26.989> do

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
can then intervene briefly just to do

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.989 
can then intervene briefly just to do
what<00:06:27.379> the<00:06:27.469> robot<00:06:27.739> asked<00:06:28.009> for<00:06:28.189> and<00:06:28.459> then<00:06:28.849> let

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:28.999 
what the robot asked for and then let

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.879 
what the robot asked for and then let
the<00:06:29.119> robot<00:06:29.599> become<00:06:30.049> autonomous<00:06:30.229> once<00:06:30.619> again

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
the robot become autonomous once again

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.889 
the robot become autonomous once again
so<00:06:31.639> this<00:06:31.759> way<00:06:31.909> if<00:06:32.059> you<00:06:32.179> have<00:06:32.299> a<00:06:32.329> system<00:06:32.689> that's

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:32.899 
so this way if you have a system that's

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.619 
so this way if you have a system that's
maybe<00:06:33.109> 95<00:06:33.769> percent<00:06:34.219> autonomous<00:06:34.789> it's<00:06:35.269> it's

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
maybe 95 percent autonomous it's it's

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.379 
maybe 95 percent autonomous it's it's
still<00:06:35.809> vastly<00:06:36.229> more<00:06:36.499> capable<00:06:36.919> than<00:06:37.189> a<00:06:37.819> system

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
still vastly more capable than a system

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.759 
still vastly more capable than a system
that<00:06:38.509> had<00:06:38.659> to<00:06:38.779> be<00:06:38.929> strictly<00:06:39.379> a<00:06:39.499> hundred

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:39.769 
that had to be strictly a hundred

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:42.279 
that had to be strictly a hundred
percent<00:06:39.860> autonomous<00:06:40.489> I<00:06:40.699> should<00:06:41.599> say<00:06:41.749> the<00:06:41.899> the

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
percent autonomous I should say the the

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.079 
percent autonomous I should say the the
language<00:06:43.069> work<00:06:43.279> is<00:06:43.429> in<00:06:43.579> collaboration<00:06:44.059> with
