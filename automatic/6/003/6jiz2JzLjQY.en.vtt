00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.020
00:00:05,240 --&gt; 00:00:09,669
for those of you that only have

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.780
this type of yarn winder

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.050
00:00:09,669 --&gt; 00:00:14,329
and you want to take, you get some thin yarn

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.420
that iss made for the standard gauge machine

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.791
00:00:14,329 --&gt; 00:00:16,650
or fine gauge machine

00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:19.070
00:00:16,650 --&gt; 00:00:21,960
and you don't have that machine you had

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.820
a mid gauge or bulky

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.450
00:00:21,960 --&gt; 00:00:25,669
well there is a way you could work around

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.450
that

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.060
00:00:25,669 --&gt; 00:00:27,199
so first of all

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.349
00:00:27,199 --&gt; 00:00:28,910
if you have a cone

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.060
00:00:28,910 --&gt; 00:00:32,840
you could probably get it on there, you will

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.930
have to stuff it the here's a little

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.980
00:00:32,840 --&gt; 00:00:37,610
so it holds it in place but agaIn it's only

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.980
going
to wind so much on there

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.730
00:00:37,610 --&gt; 00:00:41,810
but we need to get it so that the yarn can

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.800
go through the center here through

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800
00:00:41,810 --&gt; 00:00:42,910
the top

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.370
00:00:42,910 --&gt; 00:00:46,870
so we could ply them together now

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.600
00:00:48,450 --&gt; 00:00:50,230
I lucked out

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.010
00:00:50,230 --&gt; 00:00:55,059
and with this cardboard tube, which I'm

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.400
sure you know we're comes from

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.130
00:00:55,059 --&gt; 00:00:56,450
I need to find the slit I made

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.879
00:00:56,450 --&gt; 00:01:03,450
there we go

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.460
00:01:07,120 --&gt; 00:01:09,370
you want to make a little slitt

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.140
00:01:09,370 --&gt; 00:01:12,670
in one end is all, you don't want

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.280
to pull it out too much

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.720
00:01:12,670 --&gt; 00:01:15,420
now luckily this fits on just right

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.810
00:01:15,420 --&gt; 00:01:18,270
if not I would cut it down

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.740
00:01:18,270 --&gt; 00:01:21,390
put it around this and tape it really tight

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.380
00:01:21,390 --&gt; 00:01:25,170
or if it's too small

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.600
00:01:25,170 --&gt; 00:01:28,750
then I would still cut it down, take a 2nd

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600
one and cut
it down

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.930
00:01:28,750 --&gt; 00:01:32,110
and put two of them on, tape it together

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.890
00:01:32,110 --&gt; 00:01:36,740
now I do we have two yarns already plied here

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.070
00:01:36,740 --&gt; 00:01:39,000
but I want to ply it with a third one

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.010
00:01:39,000 --&gt; 00:01:44,470
so what I do is I'd just take the end of the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.890
yarn
put it in that little slit

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.060
00:01:44,470 --&gt; 00:01:46,900
and then I wind it up

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.430
00:01:46,900 --&gt; 00:01:49,060
now I don't go too fast

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.810
00:01:49,060 --&gt; 00:01:52,510
I did and the tube went flying off

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.450
00:01:52,510 --&gt; 00:01:55,660
so you want to go slow with this

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.720
00:01:55,660 --&gt; 00:02:00,430
maybe stop every once in awhile, make sure

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.810
that's down tight

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.490
00:02:00,430 --&gt; 00:02:04,670
and just continue winding up

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.610
00:02:04,670 --&gt; 00:02:07,970
your yarn until you're done

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.939
00:02:07,970 --&gt; 00:02:10,679
so here is this finish one

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.790
00:02:10,679 --&gt; 00:02:12,409
and there is the hole

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.829
00:02:12,409 --&gt; 00:02:18,389
sometimes on a wind yarn on this type of

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.610
winder, you will have a little hole in the
middle

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.180
00:02:18,389 --&gt; 00:02:21,129
but I would prefer a have this core

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.549
00:02:21,129 --&gt; 00:02:27,859
cardboard core tube so that I know I

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.689
could do what I want to

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.189
00:02:27,859 --&gt; 00:02:31,769
so I have this, I have my other blue one here

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.769
00:02:31,769 --&gt; 00:02:33,930
now I am going to set up these yarns

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.090
00:02:33,930 --&gt; 00:02:36,650
so that the blue is going to wrap-around

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.879
00:02:36,650 --&gt; 00:02:42,139
the red and white yarn and hold it all together

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.450
00:02:42,139 --&gt; 00:02:46,369
as you see I've got the red and white one

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.809
on the second shelf

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.010
00:02:46,369 --&gt; 00:02:49,879
if I had a third one I would have had

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.010
one on the bottom

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.829
00:02:49,879 --&gt; 00:02:51,619
so I could have

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.469
00:02:51,619 --&gt; 00:02:56,969
three going up, but I already have two

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.249
on that one I don't need it

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.749
00:02:56,969 --&gt; 00:03:00,409
or I can get three done and then

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:00.970
00:03:00,409 --&gt; 00:03:01,599
have another

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.569
00:03:01,599 --&gt; 00:03:05,699
set of three done and put those

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.120
together to make it six ply

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.340
00:03:05,699 --&gt; 00:03:09,689
and it will work, you should get that to work

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.650
on
the bulky no problem

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.579
00:03:09,689 --&gt; 00:03:11,329
so now I've got the yarn from the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.579
00:03:11,329 --&gt; 00:03:15,339
red and white coming out

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.049
through the center hole here

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.889
00:03:15,339 --&gt; 00:03:18,979
and then I got it going through the

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:17.889
core

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.440
00:03:18,979 --&gt; 00:03:22,419
but I need to pull that yarn to make sure

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.900
00:03:22,419 --&gt; 00:03:25,180
that's right over the hole

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.469
00:03:25,180 --&gt; 00:03:29,469
then I am going to take these three yarns

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.809
00:03:29,469 --&gt; 00:03:32,819
and what I am going to do is just take

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.829
my crochet hook stick it down through the

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.449
00:03:32,819 --&gt; 00:03:36,909
top hole and pull it up through

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.529
00:03:36,909 --&gt; 00:03:42,849
thread it through my winder in just a

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.529
winding away

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:46.379
00:03:42,849 --&gt; 00:03:47,119
so as I go slow you could see that the blue

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.900
00:03:47,119 --&gt; 00:03:50,449
because I'm taking it from the outside

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900
of the yarn cake

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.540
00:03:50,449 --&gt; 00:03:54,589
is actually wrapping around the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.689
red and white yarn

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.180
00:03:54,589 --&gt; 00:03:57,789
and I think you can see the red and white

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
yarn

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.059
00:03:57,789 --&gt; 00:04:00,389
is even twisted on itself to

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.519
00:04:00,389 --&gt; 00:04:03,519
it is best to kind of get it twisted

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.510
00:04:03,519 --&gt; 00:04:06,109
for years I would just take

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.329
00:04:06,109 --&gt; 00:04:06,989
the different yarns and wind them together

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.469
00:04:06,989 --&gt; 00:04:11,329
without them being twisted

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.859
00:04:12,279 --&gt; 00:04:12,279
and they would not really work that well on

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:14.890
the
machine

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.010
00:04:15,869 --&gt; 00:04:17,169
so

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.580
00:04:17,169 --&gt; 00:04:19,819
I hope some of you get to do this with

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.810
00:04:19,819 --&gt; 00:04:23,290
when you get some thin yarn and don't know

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.810
what to do with that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.200
00:04:23,290 --&gt; 00:04:29,389
make it up so that you can work it up on your

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.720
mid gauge or bulky machine

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.870
00:04:29,389 --&gt; 00:04:31,969
and here is my finished yarn

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.810
00:04:31,969 --&gt; 00:04:35,349
now when you look at it it doesn't look

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.030
like it twisted

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.310
00:04:35,349 --&gt; 00:04:40,119
but when you work it up on the machine

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.910
you will see that it is twisted

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.320
00:04:40,119 --&gt; 00:04:43,520
now if you don't have shelf thing like I have

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.990
00:04:43,520 --&gt; 00:04:45,889
you use a milk create

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.940
00:04:45,889 --&gt; 00:04:47,599
anything that has holes in it

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.190
00:04:47,599 --&gt; 00:04:50,830
that you could put your... hi there Rosie

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.360
00:04:52,270 --&gt; 00:04:53,920
you can put your cone on

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.130
00:04:53,920 --&gt; 00:04:56,789
or your homemade cone

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.060
00:04:56,789 --&gt; 00:05:00,029
just so you can get the yen to come up through

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.690
00:05:00,029 --&gt; 00:05:03,210
in this case I would have a yarn on the floor

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.121
00:05:03,210 --&gt; 00:05:08,520
put the next one up, put another milk crate

00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:07.330
on
put this on the second one

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.870
00:05:08,520 --&gt; 00:05:10,960
I may have to put a board

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.690
00:05:10,960 --&gt; 00:05:14,029
clamp a board or tie a board to the top one

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.410
00:05:14,029 --&gt; 00:05:18,860
of these crates just so that I can get

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.690
my yarn winder on there

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.190
00:05:18,860 --&gt; 00:05:21,069
or maybe just have a table

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.940
00:05:21,069 --&gt; 00:05:25,919
that is a little bit higher than what I have

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.940
for the milk crates

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.620
00:05:25,919 --&gt; 00:05:29,839
I'm sure you'll be able to find

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.180
something and to be able to get some at this

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.250
00:05:29,839 --&gt; 00:05:31,900
thinner yarn worked up

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.460
00:05:31,900 --&gt; 00:05:36,639
so you could use, make your own yarn and use

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.460
it

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.370
00:05:36,639 --&gt; 00:05:37,199
on your bulky or mid gauge machines
