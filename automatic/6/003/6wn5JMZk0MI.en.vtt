 the book that Ms. Baker reads is 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.940

 the hallway as one is your attention and 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.290
 it feels probably was because of an error 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.470
 of animation or maybe it's something 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.480
 more sinister when getting up on the letter 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.880

 women of garbage trucks that is a 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.820
 parody of the pizza on the roof of the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.520
 house of the main character of the series 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.709

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.470
 with the wind making them show 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.569
 the legs is the same as the movie 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.269

 that look like cami co2 of the sims is 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.550
 the console releases a parody of 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.099
 sega genesis nintendo 64 and nintendo wii 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.500
 on several occasions you can see 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.110
 posters of resident evil 4 and tomb raider 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.720
 in the room to see if sumo won the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.970
 video game do ya 64 because it did not fall in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.859
 the joke of the killer the mask of 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.660
 hockey and the theme that bellson used 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.240
 to scare everyone were clear 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.250
 references to jensen while the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.460
 final scene is an obvious parody the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.470
 final scene of massacre in texas 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.380
 pilot expansion shows how it 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.419
 They met clarence added and added jeff 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.120
 I had hair but Clarence cut it 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.850
 the head of jeff is similar to steve the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.740
 main character of minecraft I do not know 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.260
 you but the clarence card me 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.479
 left something intrigued is it possible that the 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.310
 final is just a fantasy in the head 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.689
 of clarence like larry probably 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.419
 I would be dead when clear 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.519
 is an old man the end of the episode is 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.219
 a parody of the cartoons of 

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:02.589
 hanna-barbera of the supersonic and by 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:04.449
 last a little theory of mine I think 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.189
 that Clarence has a brother of whom 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.019
 nothing is spoken by some stranger 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.789
 reason and I say it because the bed of 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:11.439
 Clarence is for two people in the 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.449
 his brother would sleep and if they saw the 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.189
 episode a great day with a girl 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.409
 They declare know that parents are 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.449
 they divorced and we could say that their 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.059
 brother lives with your dad you what 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.769
 they think good thanks for watching this video 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.360
 if you liked give thumbs up and 

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:28.329
 share it with your friends 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.219
 goodbye everything means I liked to eat that 

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:32.219
 all supposedly allowed
