and everything but I've been having a
problem<00:00:26.279> lately<00:00:26.550> with<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.760> car<00:00:27.029> when<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> turn

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
problem lately with the car when I turn

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.259 
problem lately with the car when I turn
it<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.470> makes<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.220> screeching<00:00:29.820> clicking

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
it on it makes a screeching clicking

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.450 
it on it makes a screeching clicking
sound<00:00:30.599> once<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> warms<00:00:31.619> up<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> goes<00:00:32.009> away<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> I

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
sound once it warms up it goes away so I

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
sound once it warms up it goes away so I
was<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.059> seat<00:00:36.329> belt<00:00:36.540> off<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
was gonna take a seat belt off from it I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.400 
was gonna take a seat belt off from it I
got<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> off<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:41.420> pretty<00:00:42.420> much<00:00:42.660> I'm

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
got it off and so pretty much I'm

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.299 
got it off and so pretty much I'm
replacing<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> alternator<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.219> how

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
replacing the alternator so this is how

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.799 
replacing the alternator so this is how
to<00:00:47.370> replace<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.789> alternator<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.390> ALICE<00:00:48.600> one

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to replace an alternator on an ALICE one

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.700 
to replace an alternator on an ALICE one
so<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> 15<00:00:52.640> 15<00:00:53.640> wrench<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:55.680> know

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so you take a 15 15 wrench or a you know

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.819 
so you take a 15 15 wrench or a you know
socket<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> whatever<00:00:57.059> ratchet<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.649> take

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
socket and whatever ratchet and you take

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.139 
socket and whatever ratchet and you take
that<00:00:58.949> off<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> take<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.370> belt<00:00:59.609> off<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that off you take your belt off now the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.399 
that off you take your belt off now the
deal<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.170> did<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> grabbed

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
deal was when I did that I you grabbed

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.530 
deal was when I did that I you grabbed
the<00:01:04.439> alternator<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.939> turn<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> can

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the alternator and you turn it you can

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.640 
the alternator and you turn it you can
hear<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> screeching<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.520> more<00:01:11.760> than<00:01:11.939> likely

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
hear it screeching and more than likely

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:22.340 
hear it screeching and more than likely
that<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> bearing<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> here's<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that is the bearing so so here's the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
that is the bearing so so here's the
deal<00:01:23.420> I'm<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> replace<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> alternator

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
deal I'm going to replace the alternator

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
deal I'm going to replace the alternator
it's<00:01:26.220> an<00:01:26.340> advanced<00:01:26.820> part<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.390> already

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it's an advanced part so it's already

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's an advanced part so it's already
been<00:01:27.600> replaced<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> couple<00:01:28.650> years

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
been replaced this was a couple years

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.289 
been replaced this was a couple years
ago<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.100> replaced<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> lifetime<00:01:30.150> warranty

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
ago I replaced it's a lifetime warranty

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.260 
ago I replaced it's a lifetime warranty
part<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.220> gonna<00:01:32.369> spray<00:01:32.549> some<00:01:32.579> wd-40<00:01:33.180> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
part so I was gonna spray some wd-40 on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
part so I was gonna spray some wd-40 on
it<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.990> now<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.380> thought

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it not going to do that now I thought

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.050 
it not going to do that now I thought
maybe<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.040> some<00:01:35.189> small<00:01:35.430> squeak<00:01:35.820> but

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
maybe it was just some small squeak but

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.340 
maybe it was just some small squeak but
it's<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.600> bearing<00:01:36.960> canfield

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's not it's bearing canfield

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
it's not it's bearing canfield
resistance<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> pulley<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.670> that's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
resistance on the pulley and if that's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.249 
resistance on the pulley and if that's
the<00:01:38.970> case<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> bearings<00:01:39.930> starting<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the case then the bearings starting to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.630 
the case then the bearings starting to
go<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:41.070> than<00:01:41.189> likely<00:01:41.310> need<00:01:41.579> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
go out and you more than likely need to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.899 
go out and you more than likely need to
replace<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> obviously<00:01:44.430> you're<00:01:44.670> working

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
replace it so obviously you're working

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.280 
replace it so obviously you're working
on<00:01:44.970> electrical<00:01:45.390> system<00:01:45.689> part<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> car<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
on electrical system part of the car you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
on electrical system part of the car you
disconnect<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> battery<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.299> 8

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
disconnect the battery so it's an 8

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
disconnect the battery so it's an 8
millimeter<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.649> disconnect<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.220> ground<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
millimeter you disconnect the ground a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.770 
millimeter you disconnect the ground a
positive<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.299> connect<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.540> battery

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
positive just connect the battery

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.649 
positive just connect the battery
completely<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.399> then<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.579> take<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> 15<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
completely and then you take a 15 and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
completely and then you take a 15 and
you<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:56.340> undone<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you get that undone so then you get the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.870 
you get that undone so then you get the
belt<00:01:59.460> off

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
belt off

got another one and then you let the
Crippen<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.340> wire<00:04:36.520> on<00:04:36.760> there<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.060> get

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
Crippen of the wire on there and get

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.520 
Crippen of the wire on there and get
that<00:04:37.300> all<00:04:37.449> set<00:04:37.660> up<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:37.960> we<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.139> go<00:04:38.229> back<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.410> the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
because I had the way for the alternator

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.180 
because I had the way for the alternator

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
wire to the back of the alternator right

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.570

everything so now what I got to do is

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.860 
everything so now what I got to do is
I'll<00:05:14.530> install<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:14.889> bracket<00:05:15.130> first<00:05:15.870> actually

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
I'll install a bracket first actually

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.860 
I'll install a bracket first actually
I'll<00:05:16.930> probably<00:05:17.729> ya<00:05:18.729> know<00:05:19.539> install<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
I'll probably ya know install the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.909 
I'll probably ya know install the
bracket<00:05:20.169> first<00:05:20.349> once<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> brackets

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
bracket first once the brackets

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.969 
bracket first once the brackets
installed<00:05:21.630> all<00:05:22.630> that's<00:05:22.870> done<00:05:23.139> I've<00:05:23.560> got<00:05:23.860> a

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
installed all that's done I've got a

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.219 
installed all that's done I've got a
crimp<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.340> wire<00:05:24.639> on<00:05:24.880> with<00:05:25.599> that<00:05:25.750> boot<00:05:26.020> and

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
crimp that wire on with that boot and

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.480 
crimp that wire on with that boot and
everything<00:05:26.500> on<00:05:26.620> there<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:26.919> it<00:05:27.039> looks<00:05:27.430> like

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
everything on there so it looks like

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.700 
everything on there so it looks like
factory<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.810> boot<00:05:28.990> shield<00:05:29.320> different

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
factory and that boot shield different

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.450 
factory and that boot shield different
moisturing<00:05:31.199> rusting<00:05:32.199> and<00:05:32.260> stuff<00:05:32.470> early<00:05:32.770> but

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
moisturing rusting and stuff early but

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.120 
moisturing rusting and stuff early but
yeah<00:05:33.760> we'll<00:05:34.000> get<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.270> crimped<00:05:34.570> on<00:05:34.690> there<00:05:34.930> and

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
yeah we'll get that crimped on there and

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.570 
yeah we'll get that crimped on there and
then<00:05:36.130> we'll<00:05:36.250> get<00:05:36.340> going<00:05:37.620> all<00:05:38.620> right<00:05:38.680> so<00:05:39.460> when

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
then we'll get going all right so when

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.150 
then we'll get going all right so when
you're<00:05:39.639> going<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:39.970> put<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.300> alternator<00:05:40.750> in

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
you're going to put this alternator in

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.110 
you're going to put this alternator in
it<00:05:42.160> gets<00:05:42.370> kind<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.580> confusing<00:05:42.729> with<00:05:43.090> the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
it gets kind of confusing with the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.150 
it gets kind of confusing with the
bracket<00:05:43.630> in<00:05:43.780> place<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.770> just<00:05:44.889> got<00:05:45.010> to<00:05:45.070> be

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
bracket in place you just got to be

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.890 
bracket in place you just got to be
careful<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.789> drain<00:05:46.030> plastic<00:05:46.599> shield<00:05:46.810> in

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
careful of the drain plastic shield in

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.060 
careful of the drain plastic shield in
the<00:05:46.990> back<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.349> you<00:05:47.860> go<00:05:48.070> in<00:05:48.250> right<00:05:48.550> here<00:05:48.610> right

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
the back and you go in right here right

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.830 
the back and you go in right here right
in<00:05:51.070> this<00:05:51.190> opening<00:05:51.580> here<00:05:51.880> closest<00:05:52.599> to<00:05:52.750> the

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
in this opening here closest to the

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.469 
in this opening here closest to the
frame<00:05:53.050> rail<00:05:53.280> if<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.400> move<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.699> wiring<00:05:55.030> you

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
frame rail if you move the wiring you

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:56.820 
frame rail if you move the wiring you
can<00:05:55.630> wiggle<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:56.080> in<00:05:56.110> there<00:05:56.380> with<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.620> pulley

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
can wiggle it in there with the pulley

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.790 
can wiggle it in there with the pulley
facing<00:05:57.220> down<00:05:57.400> and<00:05:57.750> then<00:05:58.750> you<00:05:58.960> you<00:05:59.530> just<00:05:59.680> wiggle

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
facing down and then you you just wiggle

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800 
facing down and then you you just wiggle
in<00:06:00.039> place<00:06:00.250> now<00:06:00.849> that<00:06:00.880> it's<00:06:01.210> in<00:06:01.270> place<00:06:01.419> I<00:06:01.690> get

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
in place now that it's in place I get

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.810 
in place now that it's in place I get
the<00:06:01.900> wires<00:06:02.110> on<00:06:02.440> and<00:06:02.680> everything<00:06:03.039> all<00:06:03.250> you<00:06:03.699> have

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
the wires on and everything all you have

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.450 
the wires on and everything all you have
to<00:06:03.970> do<00:06:04.120> is<00:06:04.360> just<00:06:04.599> tighten<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.169> 315<00:06:05.950> on<00:06:06.370> the

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
to do is just tighten the 315 on the

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.330 
to do is just tighten the 315 on the
front<00:06:07.030> here<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:07.479> then<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.200> 115<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:09.070> bolts

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
front here and then the 115 that bolts

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.600 
front here and then the 115 that bolts
the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
the

the
back<00:06:09.699> it<00:06:09.909> to<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.150> block<00:06:10.389> and<00:06:10.659> then<00:06:11.080> the<00:06:11.139> 13<00:06:11.650> I

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
back it to the block and then the 13 I

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.980 
back it to the block and then the 13 I
did<00:06:12.939> it<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.090> hard<00:06:13.270> way<00:06:13.300> you<00:06:13.449> really<00:06:13.780> only<00:06:13.930> have

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.330 
did it the hard way you really only have
to<00:06:14.110> do<00:06:14.259> the<00:06:14.349> 13<00:06:14.680> up<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:14.889> back<00:06:15.099> of<00:06:15.129> the

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
to do the 13 up the back of the

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.520 
to do the 13 up the back of the
alternator<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.900> get<00:06:17.050> it<00:06:17.139> off<00:06:17.229> that<00:06:17.379> one

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
alternator to get it off that one

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.779 
alternator to get it off that one
bracket<00:06:17.949> but<00:06:18.099> it<00:06:18.159> just<00:06:18.280> makes<00:06:18.460> it<00:06:18.520> easier<00:06:18.759> to

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
bracket but it just makes it easier to

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.999 
bracket but it just makes it easier to
reinstall<00:06:19.300> it<00:06:19.330> on<00:06:19.539> the<00:06:19.659> line<00:06:19.810> at<00:06:19.960> all<00:06:20.020> once<00:06:20.319> so

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
reinstall it on the line at all once so

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.159 
reinstall it on the line at all once so
once<00:06:21.639> you<00:06:21.699> get<00:06:21.789> that<00:06:21.909> done<00:06:22.120> then<00:06:22.750> put<00:06:22.900> the<00:06:22.990> belt

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
once you get that done then put the belt

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.070 
once you get that done then put the belt
back<00:06:23.199> on<00:06:23.469> and<00:06:23.680> then<00:06:24.599> we'll<00:06:25.599> get<00:06:25.689> back<00:06:25.780> up<00:06:25.930> top

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
back on and then we'll get back up top

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.399 
back on and then we'll get back up top
and<00:06:26.259> do<00:06:26.319> that<00:06:26.439> so<00:06:26.710> here<00:06:27.069> we<00:06:27.129> go

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
and do that so here we go

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.249 
and do that so here we go
