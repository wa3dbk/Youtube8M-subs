come to a boil you want to maybe stir it
periodically<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.190> doesn't

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
periodically just so that it doesn't

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.070 
periodically just so that it doesn't
stick<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.880> bottom<00:01:11.030> every<00:01:11.570> now<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:11.930> then

clogged<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:35.990> let's<00:01:36.229> get<00:01:36.350> started<00:01:36.500> let's<00:01:36.860> make

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
clogged so let's get started let's make

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.639 
clogged so let's get started let's make
the<00:01:37.130> pin<00:01:37.280> here<00:01:37.600> okay<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:38.660> I<00:01:38.810> had<00:01:39.080> about<00:01:39.170> half<00:01:39.470> a

add vinegar to the milk to actually

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.249 
add vinegar to the milk to actually
separate<00:01:52.429> it<00:01:52.640> there's<00:01:53.330> really<00:01:53.569> no<00:01:53.869> exact

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
separate it there's really no exact

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.200 
separate it there's really no exact
measurement<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.890> want<00:01:55.069> to<00:01:55.190> add<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:55.580> much<00:01:55.880> as

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
measurement you want to add as much as

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.630 
measurement you want to add as much as
it<00:01:56.539> takes<00:01:56.840> for<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:58.039> milk<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.429> start

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
it takes for the milk to start

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.760 
it takes for the milk to start
separating<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.539> then<00:01:59.750> for<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.259> Kurds<00:02:00.500> to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
separating and then for the Kurds to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.770 
separating and then for the Kurds to
start<00:02:01.009> forming<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:01.550> I'm<00:02:01.610> got<00:02:02.240> about<00:02:02.450> two

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
start forming so I'm got about two

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.160 
start forming so I'm got about two
tablespoons<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.679> I'm<00:02:03.860> used<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:04.729> far<00:02:04.970> a

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
tablespoons that I'm used so far a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.050 
tablespoons that I'm used so far a
little<00:02:06.170> bit<00:02:06.349> more<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:07.700> wait<00:02:07.910> and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
little bit more and then just wait and

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.270 
little bit more and then just wait and
see<00:02:08.149> for<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.539> couple<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.110> minutes<00:02:09.229> whether<00:02:10.190> or

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
see for a couple of minutes whether or

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.800 
see for a couple of minutes whether or
not<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.640> actually<00:02:10.670> does<00:02:11.239> start<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:11.630> separate

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
not it actually does start to separate

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
not it actually does start to separate
just<00:02:14.810> give<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.140> good<00:02:15.290> stir<00:02:15.610> now<00:02:16.610> if<00:02:16.700> you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
just give it a good stir now if you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.699 
just give it a good stir now if you
don't<00:02:16.880> want<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.150> use<00:02:17.239> vinegar<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.020> can<00:02:18.410> also

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
don't want to use vinegar you can also

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.369 
don't want to use vinegar you can also
use<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.910> some<00:02:20.030> lemon<00:02:20.330> juice<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:21.170> what<00:02:21.290> I'm

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
use just some lemon juice but what I'm

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.470 
use just some lemon juice but what I'm
using<00:02:21.560> today<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:22.099> just<00:02:22.310> plain<00:02:22.670> distilled

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
using today is just plain distilled

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.900 
using today is just plain distilled
white<00:02:23.810> vinegar<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:25.520> give<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> good

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
white vinegar and just give it a good

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.380 
white vinegar and just give it a good
stir<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:26.780> if<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.959> starts<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.379> separate

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
stir and see if it starts to separate

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.729 
stir and see if it starts to separate
okay<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.569> did<00:02:29.780> end<00:02:29.959> up<00:02:30.110> adding<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.709> more

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
okay so I did end up adding one more

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.130 
okay so I did end up adding one more
tablespoon<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.640> vinegar<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.480> means<00:02:32.750> in

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
tablespoon of vinegar so that means in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.770 
tablespoon of vinegar so that means in
order<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.709> make<00:02:33.860> paneer<00:02:34.220> with<00:02:34.849> half<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.330> gallons

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
order to make paneer with half a gallons

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.839 
order to make paneer with half a gallons
worth<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.230> milk<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.800> end<00:02:36.980> up<00:02:37.129> using<00:02:37.340> three

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
worth of milk you end up using three

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.850 
worth of milk you end up using three
tablespoons<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.569> vinegar<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.020> as<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.680> can

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
tablespoons of vinegar and as you can

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.400 
tablespoons of vinegar and as you can
