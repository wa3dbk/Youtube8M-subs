the other ace pilots and I'm shooting at
though

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
though

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
though
at<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.350> same<00:00:57.560> time

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.220 

but<00:01:00.940> there<00:01:01.030> are<00:01:01.090> multiple<00:01:01.210> different<00:01:01.600> stages

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
but there are multiple different stages

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.670 
but there are multiple different stages
and<00:01:02.590> here<00:01:03.010> it's<00:01:03.219> a<00:01:03.699> cityscape<00:01:04.500> over<00:01:05.500> grey

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
and here it's a cityscape over grey

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.670 
and here it's a cityscape over grey
Samaria<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.710> multiplayer<00:01:09.280> mode<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.470> can

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
Samaria in the multiplayer mode you can

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.160 
Samaria in the multiplayer mode you can
actually<00:01:11.890> ask<00:01:12.310> for<00:01:12.520> your<00:01:13.479> team's<00:01:13.720> support

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
actually ask for your team's support

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.570 
actually ask for your team's support
like<00:01:14.560> for<00:01:14.710> example<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.130> asked<00:01:15.430> when<00:01:15.520> they

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
like for example I asked when they

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.880 
like for example I asked when they
attack<00:01:15.880> request<00:01:16.240> sent<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.750> mean<00:01:17.290> we<00:01:17.350> can<00:01:17.500> do<00:01:17.649> so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
attack request sent I mean we can do so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.370 
attack request sent I mean we can do so
but<00:01:18.369> again<00:01:18.790> every<00:01:19.750> other<00:01:19.840> players<00:01:20.170> is

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
but again every other players is

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.240 
but again every other players is
controlled<00:01:20.710> by<00:01:22.290> real<00:01:23.290> humans<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.009> it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
controlled by real humans so it's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.649 
controlled by real humans so it's
completely<00:01:24.520> up<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.759> them<00:01:25.000> if<00:01:25.240> they<00:01:25.300> want<00:01:25.420> to

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
completely up to them if they want to

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.730 
completely up to them if they want to
support<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.259> or<00:01:26.320> not

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
support you or not

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.090 
support you or not
so<00:01:27.159> it's<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:28.119> it's<00:01:28.869> different<00:01:29.110> from<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
so it's so it's different from the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.430 
so it's so it's different from the
campaign<00:01:30.490> mode<00:01:30.729> where<00:01:31.440> computer-controlled

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
campaign mode where computer-controlled

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.270 
campaign mode where computer-controlled
Ally<00:01:33.340> units<00:01:33.759> will<00:01:33.970> immediately<00:01:34.979> follow<00:01:35.979> your

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
Ally units will immediately follow your

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.950 
Ally units will immediately follow your
order<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.850> shoot<00:01:37.210> missiles<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.690> it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
order and shoot missiles and it's a it's

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.529 
order and shoot missiles and it's a it's
a<00:01:41.050> very<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:42.520> I've<00:01:42.700> explained<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.360> past

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
a very as I've explained in the past

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.490 
a very as I've explained in the past
it's<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:45.210> online<00:01:46.210> battle<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.750> very<00:01:47.110> different

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
it's a online battle is very different

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's a online battle is very different
from<00:01:47.880> single-player<00:01:48.880> campaign<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:50.110> really

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
from single-player campaign you really

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.559 
from single-player campaign you really
Jennie<00:01:50.830> cannot<00:01:51.280> expect<00:01:51.610> what<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:52.000> other

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
Jennie cannot expect what the other

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.169 
Jennie cannot expect what the other
players<00:01:52.960> will<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.340> difficulty<00:01:54.880> level

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
players will do and the difficulty level

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.499 
players will do and the difficulty level
is<00:01:55.270> extremely<00:01:55.509> higher<00:01:56.200> than<00:01:57.509> regular

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
is extremely higher than regular

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.490 
is extremely higher than regular

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
like this to evade speed off use

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.660 
like this to evade speed off use
afterburner<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:49.070> if<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.280> want<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.520> make<00:02:49.640> a

really quick high G turn you speed up by

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.270 
really quick high G turn you speed up by
accelerating<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.230> then<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.680> break<00:02:55.040> at<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
accelerating and then you break at the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.730 
accelerating and then you break at the
same<00:02:55.460> time<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.060> quickly<00:02:56.270> change<00:02:56.480> its<00:02:57.290> high<00:02:57.470> G

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
same time and quickly change its high G

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.700 
same time and quickly change its high G
turn<00:02:58.010> when<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.270> can<00:02:59.510> make<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.720> turn

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
turn when you do so you can make a turn

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.710 
turn when you do so you can make a turn
incredible<00:03:01.250> at<00:03:01.640> an<00:03:01.730> incredibly<00:03:02.120> fast<00:03:02.210> speed

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
incredible at an incredibly fast speed

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.740 
incredible at an incredibly fast speed
but<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:04.040> continuously<00:03:04.550> do<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.630> will

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
but if you continuously do so you will

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.350 
but if you continuously do so you will
eventually<00:03:05.990> stall<00:03:06.710> because<00:03:07.670> your<00:03:07.850> speed<00:03:08.150> will

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
eventually stall because your speed will

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.520 
eventually stall because your speed will
drop<00:03:09.970> as<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.030> can<00:03:11.270> see<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.630> then<00:03:12.200> four

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
drop as you can see and then four

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.200 
drop as you can see and then four
seconds<00:03:13.190> will<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.520> completely<00:03:13.910> sitting

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
seconds will be a completely sitting

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.630 
seconds will be a completely sitting
duck<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.530> have<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.010> utilize<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.610> a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
duck so you have to utilize in a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.900 
duck so you have to utilize in a
strategic<00:03:17.390> manner<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.350> basically<00:03:18.740> you'll<00:03:19.730> be

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
strategic manner so basically you'll be

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.620 
strategic manner so basically you'll be
ranked<00:03:20.420> by<00:03:21.490> final<00:03:22.490> result<00:03:22.760> be<00:03:22.910> graded<00:03:23.240> by<00:03:23.270> how

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
ranked by final result be graded by how

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.650 
ranked by final result be graded by how
many<00:03:23.810> kills<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.320> have<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.250> also<00:03:25.430> what<00:03:26.390> type

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
many kills you have but also what type

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.960 
many kills you have but also what type
of<00:03:26.690> airplanes<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.410> take<00:03:27.620> down<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.280> sometimes

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
of airplanes you take down and sometimes

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.550 
of airplanes you take down and sometimes
you<00:03:29.090> can<00:03:29.240> see<00:03:29.420> actually<00:03:29.630> some<00:03:30.020> pilots<00:03:30.410> took

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
you can see actually some pilots took

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.120 
you can see actually some pilots took
down<00:03:30.680> less<00:03:31.450> less<00:03:32.450> enemies<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.740> actually<00:03:34.040> they

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
down less less enemies but actually they

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.740 
down less less enemies but actually they
get<00:03:34.220> higher<00:03:34.370> score<00:03:34.760> because<00:03:35.030> they<00:03:35.240> took<00:03:35.570> down

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
get higher score because they took down

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.210 
get higher score because they took down
probably<00:03:36.110> more<00:03:36.230> difficult<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.860> take<00:03:37.010> down

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
probably more difficult to take down

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.590 
probably more difficult to take down
planes<00:03:38.350> okay<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.000> particular<00:03:41.240> mode

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
planes okay so so this particular mode

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.800 
planes okay so so this particular mode
is<00:03:41.750> done<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.580> once<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.700> Modi's<00:03:43.940> dog<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.630> get

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
is done and once the Modi's dog you get

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.640 
is done and once the Modi's dog you get
into<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:46.190> replay<00:03:46.550> mode<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:48.110> in<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.470> game

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
into the replay mode so in the game

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.580 
into the replay mode so in the game
actually<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:49.900> both<00:03:50.900> single-player<00:03:51.410> mode

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
actually you can both single-player mode

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.699 
actually you can both single-player mode
and<00:03:51.830> online<00:03:52.100> play<00:03:52.280> mode<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:53.630> can<00:03:53.870> save<00:03:54.350> your

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
and online play mode you can save your

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.979 
and online play mode you can save your
replay<00:03:55.130> on<00:03:55.580> your<00:03:56.090> hard<00:03:56.300> drive<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.900> can

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
replay on your hard drive so you can

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.229 
replay on your hard drive so you can
actually<00:03:57.440> watch<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.850> like<00:03:58.970> any<00:03:59.120> other

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
actually watch it just like any other

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.690 
actually watch it just like any other
just<00:03:59.780> like<00:03:59.900> racing<00:04:00.350> games<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:01.340> has<00:04:01.459> different

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
just like racing games it has different

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.560 
just like racing games it has different
camera<00:04:02.330> angles<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.019> just<00:04:03.290> like<00:04:03.410> this
