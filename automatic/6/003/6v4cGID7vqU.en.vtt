00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.910
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.859
 welcome to project cats 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.959
 welcome to the kindle in this race 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.049
 against the guide I did with the porches 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.940
 of gt3 ten days ago I do not upload any 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.230
 video and it's because this year it's me 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.900
 Allergy is giving way in a way 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.160
 quite brutal but they found routine 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.840
 that I find much better and good 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.880
 well I wanted to take advantage to record 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.900
 this video to share my 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.220
 impressions about this game a game 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.530
 that as many of you already know 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.660
 I wanted to make a mistake but I did not 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.610
 I expected absolutely nothing from this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.410
 game was a game that does not wait 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.670
 absolutely nothing good and you want 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.609
 wrong because this we like the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.190
 shooters this genre is not a genre the 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.780
 have overbooked every year of 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.730
 200,000 games but the games that 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.440
 you can play a year of this genre 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.870
 they count on the fingers of a 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.219
 hand if you're lucky sometimes they have 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.749
 with the fingers of a hand of a bank 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.069
 because there are years when it does not come out 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.940
 absolutely nothing worthwhile 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.960
 play and as a lover of the genre 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.609
 I wanted to make a mistake because the truth is 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.309
 that what you have seen so far 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.899
 I generated no kind of trust like that 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.969
 To begin with I will tell you that projecting is 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.060
 the best game he plays to date 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.740
 the best racing game you play 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.790
 that is said soon the best game of 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.189
 Careers you play to date now 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.560
 well do not confuse game with simulator 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.840
 because there should not be people who when 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.670
 he starts thinking because he can not stand the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.079
 breath says I'll think and pick 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.789
 air gets air and you spend a lot of time 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.009
 thinking and it begins to affect the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.020
 lack of oxygen to the brain and it shows 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.580
 note because the ear here nonsense that is 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.229
 pass your hands to your head in fact 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.490
 there was a chemistry especially grace in 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.470
 an online magazine a magazine 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.869
 online videogames that said something like that 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.259
 how to project picks up the witness of 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.600
 seat corsa and racing or ere factor yo 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.940
 I wonder if the one who wrote this has 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.490
 approved has been thing and racing 9 factor 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.600
 more than asking, I put it firmly 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.799
 in doubt that he has done it because 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.959
 anyone who has tried any 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.520
 these three simulators then jump to the 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.709
 view that projecting does not reach even the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.720
 it is now well as a video game because it is 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.880
 infinitely better than the three together 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 thing seat possibly have the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.200
 better physics but at least I do not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.090
 offers any kind of pleasure beyond 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.590
 of the driving pleasure itself is very 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.819
 pleasant as you drive but it's 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.380
 ephemeral when you stop driving 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.509
 It disappears because nothing he does is 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 transcends is not the case of projecting 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.090
 that you also enjoy driving 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.920
 there is a kind of fictional universe in 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.900
 the one that you see yourself immersed because you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.390
 has been signing contracts is progressing 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.540
 by different categories and what you do 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.740
 in one way or another as it transcends and they go 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.840
 from things as small as 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.890
 example a kind of a kind of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 twitter a kind of social network 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.240
 fictional that the game itself has in the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 which the fan of the motor they give you 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.290
 encouragement leave you some observation about 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.459
 your last race or they tell you what 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.320
 expectations are placed on the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.390
 following things are so small 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.370
 until what kind of contracts will you receive 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.739
 at the end of the season if they are going to 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.050
 offer to renew you are going to offer and is 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.700
 competition in that same category if 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.340
 they will offer you to ascend from 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.380
 category a higher if you are going to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.030
 offer then that according to a team of 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.920
 a lower category in which already 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.570
 were you going to offer to come back and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.270
 everything depending on what you do and how 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.190
 finalize is the season 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.380
 I accept corsa the only thing that transcends a 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.820
 race if you're lucky it's the turn 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.160
 quick and I say if you're lucky because 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.540
 so that it transcends it has to be more 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.460
 quick than the one you already had with that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.100
 car in that circuit therefore 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.150
 this aspect I accept by sandoval a hard 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.280
 and I accept thing is a game that has 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.690
 dedicated many hours but neither 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.980
 much less with the intensity with the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.780
 I'm playing this this 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.480
 project why then because who 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.340
 project what I do matters what more 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.990
 it bothers me of projecting is that good 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.050
 what bothers me the most and it may be 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.690
 something that I like and now I explain what 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.310
 What is more annoying is that it can be a lot 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.920
 better in many ways 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.290
 changing small details I can 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.850
 understand then what do I know here for the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.470
 night the cars do not have if you have 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.290
 fixed in the rearview mirror you see the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.310
 lighting you see the light of the headlights 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.750
 but you can not see the one about this I do not 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.690
 they dazzle just see the 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.580
 lighting understand that that requires 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.050
 of some command resources some resources 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.110
 so very high for what I can 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.180
 offer the effect but add some 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.460
 objectives to the contracts came so 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.520
 simple and something that puts that pressure 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.530
 in the races an extra pressure to 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.980
 end the season in one position 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.870
 determined or not said is not that it is not 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.549
 what has happened to you is that who the fuck 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.799
 Who the hell came up with contracts 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.660
 in the path mode without objectives no 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.060
 I know if it's sloppiness I do not know if it's stupidity or 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.470
 lack of time I do not know why but I do not 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.410
 it seems that it requires any kind of 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.240
 prodigious programming to fuck has 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.470
 been able to program this marvel 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.570
 audiovisual with this control so 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.480
 delicious and you are not able to schedule 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.990
 some contracts in trajectory mode 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.540
 with objectives I do not know it seems a bit like a 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.630
 little strong I know a little bit but good 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.950
 I say it's something that bothers me because 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.320
 I see the possibilities with small 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.490
 changes with small improvements but it's 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.250
 I say something that I can reach 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.290
 like it because it's easy it's very easy to 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.030
 best are small details are 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.780
 little things that can be done 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.220
 something better 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.750
 They do not require 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.820
 it's not that you say it's not that you have 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.560
 shitty physics or do you say you have 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.260
 a fucking graphics no no no is that 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.210
 small things that I think are stupid 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.890
 that would make the experience of playing 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.100
 project then something much more more 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.200
 immersive more more complete the 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.730
 online multiplayer in public rooms is 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.080
 a disgust are what you would expect 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.940
 of a game that does not filter players 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.470
 has a reputation system which 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.050
 because in theory it should filter players 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.020
 you should group with people of your level 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.310
 with people from your crowd but we do not know 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.290
 how cash can become 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.720
 because it is deactivated which then 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.310
 it seems a little bit a little too something 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.740
 very important to me in a game of 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.870
 careers is the guide precisely because 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.690
 the online section then in practically 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.820
 all is something nefarious or that is not 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.040
 something that is not something exclusive to 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.930
 project the online I usually give 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.009
 pretty disgusting in all the games of 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.719
 racing except in and racing 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.779
 to 100 also has his thing has 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:59.189
 also his pearls but good without 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.770
 no doubt is the king is the king of 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.539
 multiplayer and the rest are all 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.159
 the same shit and therefore it is 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.569
 important that the individual experience 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.300
 in which there is a role 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.759
 very important be satisfactory be 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.129
 good and in project cars the beach 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.110
 It has its lights and its shadows but in 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.089
 a global assessment would say that it is 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.649
 approved that is good is fast is 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.809
 quite fast not in all 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:23.909
 disciplines in for example remember the 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:26.309
 karts I ran the first two seasons 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.139
 in karts and I remember that in racing 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:30.120
 five minutes I put a few minutes 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.219
 infernal to the best in five or six 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.759
 minutes of the race fit them 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:38.009
 better 25 or 30 seconds apart 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.860
 but in other categories like 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.139
 example the gt3 or I tested categories 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.580
 of cars such as the cup 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.530
 Clio 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.840
 they surprised me very well and they go 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.210
 pretty pretty fast they are 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.140
 and qualify them as aggressive I would say 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.300
 that a bit like 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.760
 a little like homicides without going any further 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.710
 I had to restart this race 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.420
 ten times until I got to survive 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.970
 to the first curve because I loved 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.200
 some hosts like bread and hear if you're 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.640
 playing alone they wash you and you 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.740
 You are wearing no but at least me 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.670
 I like that the videos look nice from 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.750
 anyway I do not think it's 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.840
 It is representative of what the guide 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.480
 because once it exceeds that first 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.100
 or second curve where good 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.800
 there is a bit of chaos the already leaves a little 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.420
 aside those those homicidal tendencies and 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.060
 it becomes fast it becomes aggressive 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.640
 end of position puts the nose 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.690
 presses you and the truth is that next to 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.880
 the driving that is a condition 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:36.000
 pretty pretty friendly 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.100
 Demanding demanding if you want to go fast 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.510
 but quite friendly because they make the 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.920
 individual experience be enough 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.780
 good here I almost lost the car by 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.670
 try to leave faster than the 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.780
 red that was in front of me but I think that 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.520
 very well that it had left then not 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.170
 I would have managed to gain position and nothing 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.040
 up to here my impressions on project 

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.200
 cards 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.520
 I do not know if maybe because of the allergy issue 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.700
 that leaves me quite exhausted because no 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.100
 has been everything objective or neutral or 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.410
 positive or negative that should be but 

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.540
 If there is any doubt left, my 

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.210
 valuation about this project cars is 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.080
 cojonuda I hope you liked it and 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.680
 until next time 

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.680
 chao chao
