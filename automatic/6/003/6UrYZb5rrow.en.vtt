00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
are training grounds for people who

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.970 
are training grounds for people who
wanna<00:03:35.170> play<00:03:35.290> fighting<00:03:35.590> games<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:37.859> we're<00:03:38.859> just

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
wanna play fighting games and we're just

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.619

friendly place for people to level up

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.780 
friendly place for people to level up
and<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:47.530> hang<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:47.859> at<00:03:48.159> some<00:03:48.400> point<00:03:48.639> in

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
time like there's a lot of points where

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
time like there's a lot of points where
you<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.720> talk<00:03:52.720> with<00:03:53.169> top<00:03:53.409> players<00:03:53.709> just

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
you have to talk with top players just

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.129 
you have to talk with top players just
to<00:03:54.400> understand<00:03:55.269> like<00:03:55.750> come<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:55.989> an

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
to understand like come to an

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.259 
to understand like come to an
understanding<00:03:56.169> and<00:03:56.769> then<00:03:57.310> actually<00:03:58.000> sit<00:03:58.239> down

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
understanding and then actually sit down

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.119 
understanding and then actually sit down
and<00:03:58.419> play<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.079> execute<00:03:59.620> learn<00:03:59.829> how<00:03:59.919> to<00:04:00.010> do

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
and play and execute learn how to do

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.670 
and play and execute learn how to do
those<00:04:00.250> things<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:01.329> game<00:04:01.750> because<00:04:02.139> if<00:04:02.469> you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
those things in game because if you

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.039 
those things in game because if you
don't<00:04:02.799> if<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.939> know<00:04:04.239> but<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.540> can't<00:04:04.780> execute

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
don't if you know but you can't execute

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.289 
don't if you know but you can't execute
you<00:04:05.319> can't<00:04:05.500> practice<00:04:05.680> those<00:04:06.010> situations<00:04:06.489> then

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
you can't practice those situations then

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.870 
you can't practice those situations then
it's<00:04:07.689> just<00:04:08.019> it's<00:04:08.829> just

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
it's just it's just

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.140 
it's just it's just
more<00:04:11.540> effective<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.980> we're<00:04:13.520> pretty<00:04:14.030> much

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
more effective so we're pretty much

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.370 
more effective so we're pretty much
trying<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.540> create<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.960> best<00:04:15.170> training

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
trying to create the best training

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.840 
trying to create the best training
environment<00:04:16.040> we<00:04:16.100> possibly<00:04:16.459> can<00:04:16.670> and<00:04:18.850> yeah

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
environment we possibly can and yeah

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.100 
environment we possibly can and yeah
having<00:04:20.120> top<00:04:20.300> layers<00:04:20.510> around<00:04:20.660> as<00:04:20.810> part<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.020> that

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
having top layers around as part of that

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.690 
having top layers around as part of that
because<00:04:21.350> if<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.770> learn<00:04:22.280> from<00:04:22.460> them<00:04:22.670> and

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
because if you can learn from them and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.060 
because if you can learn from them and
it<00:04:23.510> is<00:04:23.600> what<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.740> know<00:04:24.860> we<00:04:24.950> have<00:04:25.040> a

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
it is what it is so you know we have a

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.420 
it is what it is so you know we have a
team<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.280> players<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:26.080> right<00:04:27.080> now<00:04:27.320> we<00:04:27.920> still

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
team of players but right now we still

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.520 
team of players but right now we still
waiting<00:04:28.700> on<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.820> website<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.390> get<00:04:29.480> up<00:04:29.630> which<00:04:30.110> is

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
waiting on a website to get up which is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.720 
waiting on a website to get up which is
the<00:04:30.770> part<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.190> really<00:04:31.400> don't<00:04:31.550> want<00:04:31.670> to

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
the part that I really don't want to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.070 
the part that I really don't want to
talk<00:04:31.820> about<00:04:31.880> because<00:04:32.300> it's<00:04:32.540> annoying<00:04:32.870> like

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
talk about because it's annoying like

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.360 
talk about because it's annoying like
the<00:04:34.210> but<00:04:35.210> um<00:04:35.450> we<00:04:36.200> actually<00:04:36.230> had<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.830> in<00:04:37.190> order

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
the but um we actually had to in order

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.340 
the but um we actually had to in order
to<00:04:37.520> track<00:04:37.760> memberships<00:04:38.240> we<00:04:39.020> need<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.200> have<00:04:39.320> a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
to track memberships we need to have a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.720 
to track memberships we need to have a
website<00:04:39.560> up<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:41.000> don't<00:04:41.270> because

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
website up and you don't because

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.800 
website up and you don't because
nonsense<00:04:43.730> happened<00:04:44.120> with<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.540> people<00:04:44.750> that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
nonsense happened with the people that

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.930 
nonsense happened with the people that
were<00:04:44.960> doing<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.590> then<00:04:45.800> we<00:04:46.520> literally<00:04:46.730> had

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
were doing it and then we literally had

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.360 
were doing it and then we literally had
to<00:04:46.970> fire<00:04:47.330> them<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.690> month<00:04:47.930> ago<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.410> hand<00:04:49.280> the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
to fire them a month ago and hand the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.310 
to fire them a month ago and hand the
project<00:04:49.790> over<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.240> an<00:04:50.330> entirely<00:04:50.720> new<00:04:50.930> team<00:04:51.230> of

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
project over to an entirely new team of

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.110 
project over to an entirely new team of
people<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.800> we<00:04:52.310> can't<00:04:52.550> be<00:04:52.640> open<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:52.970> business

until it's done so right now we just
host<00:04:55.580> events<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:57.310> we<00:04:58.310> let<00:04:58.490> some<00:04:58.670> people<00:04:58.910> come

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
host events and we let some people come

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.030 
host events and we let some people come
by<00:04:59.240> but<00:04:59.600> it<00:04:59.750> can't<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.080> be<00:05:00.320> open<00:05:00.890> for

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040
