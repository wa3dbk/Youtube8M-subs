or fall out and remember no more metal
we<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.330> use<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> impression<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
we then use the impression to make a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.300 
we then use the impression to make a
model<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.630> model<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.890> able<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
model with this model we're then able to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.410 
model with this model we're then able to
take<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:12.619> 3d<00:01:13.619> scanner<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.670> wand<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
take our 3d scanner and this wand is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.670 
take our 3d scanner and this wand is
actually<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.320> camera<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.470> scan<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
actually a camera and then we scan the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually a camera and then we scan the
upper<00:01:20.009> teeth<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.549> well<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.560> scan<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
upper teeth as well and then we scan the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
upper teeth as well and then we scan the
bite<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:24.960> we're<00:01:25.170> able<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.530> use

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bite and that's how we're able to use

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.810 
bite and that's how we're able to use
computer-aided<00:01:26.549> software<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:29.100> create<00:01:29.610> these
