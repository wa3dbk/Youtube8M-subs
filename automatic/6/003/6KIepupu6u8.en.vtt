00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.850
 and yet 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:23.369
 You can hear this a few words Artem 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:36.059
 hello this frothy wind from moscow 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 Spartak to 12 or pictures 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.899
 [music] 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.979
 such an interesting offer to you 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.820
 heard you problems there in the club 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.229
 what's the problem for now I just want early 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 leave and 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.370
 such thing that you know my how you decided 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.470
 but where Iâ€™m looking, in principle, not yet 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 blades parted I think that after 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 holidays were new 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:22.390
 I just wanted to offer you to us 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.369
 Spartak somehow actually think me 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.509
 here are just people before offered 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.570
 looked nicknames 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:36.490
 we will again have a new coach 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.859
 I want a card no, I probably will not be on me 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:46.859
 this is someone from kuna CEO 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:46.859
 I just don't want to be all together 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.749
 give it a basis 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.780
 So I can throw off a bowl and his 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.100
 line 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.039
 work and not a couple of days I'll call you back 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.869
 okay well so does this mean when 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.969
 roughly tell you is oriented towards 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.840
 monday 2 weeks answer on the track and 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.110
 business well 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 clear and on the money adjustments to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.300
 don't say mind well then our 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.300
 the president 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:29.820
 went eight no 2 turns out very 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:36.070
 I get the benua system 10 up to two 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.140
 such a principle is not against at all 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.470
 cool we have a good truth not now 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 very performances go but it's all because 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 dollars under the ball I was starting to look 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.270
 then you look the same way in the skin 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.950
 skin nice going legionary and 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:07.930
 incomprehensible and so on and so forth 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:10.240
 Yes, as there is a blokhin then what I-I-I-I like 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.190
 I played what I did and what I beat out to 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:19.900
 accor as usual age there i'm there 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.380
 legend of the hero you don't know anything about it 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.470
 our old story with this is in my opinion 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.830
 all all young faced with this 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.440
 stories so i just want us or 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.440
 want or some foreigners often 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.810
 I consider candidates or can our 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.300
 what kind of cable is there his coach who 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.600
 little by little they would be because 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.730
 really do not grasp really 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.140
 I had to like that as it is all emotion 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.480
 good but you have to water it and you 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 returned back as if he had fallen down 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.090
 and he had all the head but what's the use 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.300
 the training process I will in any way 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.210
 yes yes after such a question is not said here 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:10.600
 somewhere podais penalties something there often 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:12.580
 that this is the story of thought these pads 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.880
 helpers burn like a story something there 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.880
 often 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.730
 but such a robot for the team even 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.730
 is useful 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:29.999
 season 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.999
