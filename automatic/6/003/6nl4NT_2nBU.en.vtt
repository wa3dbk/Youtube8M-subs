00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
they look really strong as cloud 9 i'm

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.190 
they look really strong as cloud 9 i'm
not<00:02:06.810> sure<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:08.420> maybe<00:02:09.420> conan<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
not sure like maybe conan was not a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.920 
not sure like maybe conan was not a
practiced<00:02:10.739> or<00:02:10.950> if

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
practiced or if

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.089 
practiced or if
too<00:02:11.989> many<00:02:12.140> practice<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:12.920> really

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
too many practice and it just really

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.339 
too many practice and it just really
scary<00:02:13.489> but<00:02:13.849> we<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.329> managed<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.629> beat<00:02:14.900> them<00:02:15.109> in

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
scary but we we managed to beat them in

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.490 
scary but we we managed to beat them in
the<00:02:15.409> past<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.189> hope<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.549> do<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.670> again

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the past and I hope we can do it again

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.470 
the past and I hope we can do it again
or<00:02:18.500> do<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:18.799> think<00:02:18.829> about<00:02:19.159> those<00:02:19.340> changes<00:02:20.209> for

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
or do you think about those changes for

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.259 
or do you think about those changes for
the<00:02:20.510> jungle<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.319> are<00:02:21.439> coming<00:02:21.739> now<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:22.269> it

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
the jungle that are coming now I it

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.630 
the jungle that are coming now I it
seems<00:02:23.599> like<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:24.019> rat<00:02:24.319> are<00:02:24.500> changing<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.340> jungle

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
seems like a rat are changing the jungle

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
seems like a rat are changing the jungle
every<00:02:25.939> season<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:27.290> that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
every season and do you think that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.009 
every season and do you think that
finally<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.430> will<00:02:28.579> be<00:02:28.760> fine<00:02:29.239> or<00:02:29.510> they<00:02:29.989> just

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
finally it will be fine or they just

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.949 
finally it will be fine or they just
created<00:02:30.469> more<00:02:30.680> problems<00:02:31.090> well<00:02:32.090> first<00:02:32.659> of<00:02:32.870> all

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
created more problems well first of all

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.199 
created more problems well first of all
they<00:02:33.170> need<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.560> fix<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.280> problem<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.849> double

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
they need to fix the problem with double

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.970 
they need to fix the problem with double
top<00:02:35.359> lane<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.569> think<00:02:35.930> which<00:02:36.170> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.650> renders

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
top lane I think which kind of renders

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.559 
top lane I think which kind of renders
jungle<00:02:37.430> even<00:02:37.639> useless<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.269> didn't<00:02:38.450> play

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
jungle even useless like I didn't play

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.690 
jungle even useless like I didn't play
that<00:02:38.599> much<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.139> patch<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.189> I<00:02:40.370> saw

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
that much on the patch but that's I saw

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.190 
that much on the patch but that's I saw
like<00:02:40.939> how<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.180> matter<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.629> going<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.170> a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
like how the matter is going to that a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.949 
like how the matter is going to that a
bit<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.709> mostly<00:02:43.700> yeah<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:44.090> think<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.840> new

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
bit and mostly yeah I think the new

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.720 
bit and mostly yeah I think the new
jungle<00:02:45.200> animals<00:02:45.560> are<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> bit<00:02:45.919> expensive<00:02:46.129> like

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
jungle animals are a bit expensive like

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
jungle animals are a bit expensive like
wriggle<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.480> really<00:02:47.870> great<00:02:48.139> if<00:02:48.349> you

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
wriggle is like really great if you

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.229 
wriggle is like really great if you
could<00:02:48.590> get<00:02:48.859> it<00:02:48.980> early<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.639> pretty<00:02:50.120> much

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
could get it early but you pretty much

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.940 
could get it early but you pretty much
have<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.510> group<00:02:50.780> already<00:02:50.959> if<00:02:51.439> when<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.829> get

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
have to group already if when you get

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.819 
have to group already if when you get
regular<00:02:52.280> especially<00:02:52.669> in<00:02:52.760> team<00:02:52.909> games<00:02:53.180> so

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
regular especially in team games so

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.720 
regular especially in team games so
normally<00:02:54.829> your<00:02:54.950> lanes<00:02:55.189> are<00:02:55.370> taking<00:02:55.639> your

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
normally your lanes are taking your

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.129 
normally your lanes are taking your
jungle<00:02:55.970> as<00:02:56.090> well<00:02:56.269> if<00:02:56.419> you<00:02:56.510> are<00:02:56.540> roaming<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.989> bit

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
jungle as well if you are roaming a bit

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.110 
jungle as well if you are roaming a bit
so<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:57.409> don't<00:02:57.650> get<00:02:57.739> full<00:02:57.950> profit<00:02:58.159> from<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.609> so

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
so you don't get full profit from it so

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.849 
so you don't get full profit from it so
they<00:02:59.419> have<00:02:59.540> some<00:02:59.719> things<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.079> fix<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.620> think

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
they have some things to fix I think

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.280 
they have some things to fix I think
they're<00:03:01.340> going<00:03:01.609> in<00:03:01.939> the<00:03:02.150> right<00:03:02.329> direction<00:03:02.510> if

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
they're going in the right direction if

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.319 
they're going in the right direction if
they<00:03:03.530> just<00:03:03.709> fix<00:03:03.950> some<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.129> these<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.669> price

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
they just fix some of these like price

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.259 
they just fix some of these like price
things<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.139> then<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.500> item<00:03:07.189> which<00:03:07.939> name<00:03:08.150> I

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
things and then the item which name I

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.599 
things and then the item which name I
can<00:03:08.450> remember<00:03:08.689> the<00:03:09.019> jargon<00:03:09.469> yeah<00:03:10.159> I<00:03:10.340> really

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
can remember the jargon yeah I really

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.089 
can remember the jargon yeah I really
shoot<00:03:10.939> yet<00:03:11.389> which<00:03:11.689> upgrades<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.620> Targon

something<00:03:15.010> yes<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.609> think<00:03:16.879> it's<00:03:17.269> possible

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
something yes do you think it's possible

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.280 
something yes do you think it's possible
that<00:03:17.889> they<00:03:18.889> want<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.329> make<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.449> games<00:03:20.690> in<00:03:20.989> such

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
that they want to make the games in such

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.500 
that they want to make the games in such
a<00:03:21.319> way<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:22.370> team<00:03:22.639> plays<00:03:22.909> with<00:03:23.419> the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
a way that one team plays with the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.420 
a way that one team plays with the
Jaguar<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.229> other<00:03:24.349> place<00:03:24.650> with<00:03:24.859> 212

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
Jaguar and the other place with 212

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.780 
Jaguar and the other place with 212
composition<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.739> two<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:28.220> break<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.579> meta

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
composition and two to break the meta

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.339 
composition and two to break the meta
bit<00:03:30.310> hmm<00:03:31.310> yeah<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.389> would<00:03:32.569> be<00:03:32.599> really<00:03:32.959> very

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
bit hmm yeah that would be really very

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.719 
bit hmm yeah that would be really very
of<00:03:33.470> them<00:03:33.590> like<00:03:33.769> obviously<00:03:34.159> I<00:03:34.250> wouldn't<00:03:34.459> like

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
of them like obviously I wouldn't like

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.429 
of them like obviously I wouldn't like
the<00:03:34.879> change<00:03:35.090> because<00:03:35.449> i<00:03:35.629> like<00:03:35.810> my<00:03:35.930> role<00:03:36.109> as<00:03:36.290> it

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
the change because i like my role as it

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.009 
the change because i like my role as it
is<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.010> i<00:03:37.209> guess<00:03:38.209> some<00:03:38.389> people<00:03:38.720> would<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:38.989> happy

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
is so i guess some people would be happy
