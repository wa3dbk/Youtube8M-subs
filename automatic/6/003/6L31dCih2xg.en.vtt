00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.390

 badly the apps are there but not that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.520

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.579
 the games apps are more together 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.290

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.680
 when you are downloading 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.600
 a game and down or left and we see 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.840

 50% use this is really not bad 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.500
 and what's more is that we can 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.700
 for that nothing keyboards want 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 if they want to plug in a keyboard 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.640

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.469

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.299
