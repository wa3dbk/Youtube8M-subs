really<00:01:21.840> hasn't<00:01:22.100> broken<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.549> even<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.270> i

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
really hasn't broken into even what i

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
really hasn't broken into even what i
would<00:01:24.509> call<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> real<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.500> class<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.040> turns

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
would call the the real a class of turns

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.740 
would call the the real a class of turns
where<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> wouldn't<00:01:26.850> consider<00:01:26.939> him<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.420> right

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
where I wouldn't consider him one right

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390 
where I wouldn't consider him one right
now<00:01:27.900> maybe<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.710> seen<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.130> many<00:01:29.189> games

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
now maybe because I'm seen so many games

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
now maybe because I'm seen so many games
i'm<00:01:29.579> actually<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.630> reserve<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
i'm actually I would reserve that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
i'm actually I would reserve that
decision<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.740> certainly<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.520> very

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
decision but I certainly is not very

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
decision but I certainly is not very

has gone for a double Nexus before

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.820 
has gone for a double Nexus before

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
gateway that's right here OV going for

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.850 
gateway that's right here OV going for
not<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> 14<00:03:17.940> Nexus<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.900> 114<00:03:19.530> Nexus<00:03:19.829> but

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
not a 14 Nexus not just 114 Nexus but

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.590 
not a 14 Nexus not just 114 Nexus but
going<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> double<00:03:20.519> expand<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.090> Midas<00:03:21.420> here

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
going for a double expand on Midas here

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.080 
going for a double expand on Midas here
on<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> map<00:03:21.930> plasma<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.650> since<00:03:23.250> he<00:03:23.430> figures

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
on the map plasma and since he figures

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.580 
on the map plasma and since he figures
it's<00:03:24.269> an<00:03:24.360> island<00:03:24.540> map<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.200> he<00:03:25.320> figures

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it's an island map I think he figures

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.229 
it's an island map I think he figures
this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> viable<00:03:27.060> possibility

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
this is a you know a viable possibility

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.490 
this is a you know a viable possibility
but<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:27.959> absolutely<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:29.840> s<00:03:30.840> insane

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
but this is absolutely that s insane

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.979 
but this is absolutely that s insane
because<00:03:32.280> I've<00:03:32.519> never<00:03:33.030> seen<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.420> before<00:03:33.480> I

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
because I've never seen this before I

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.870 
because I've never seen this before I
don't<00:03:34.530> think<00:03:34.560> Eddie<00:03:34.890> protoss<00:03:35.340> has<00:03:35.549> ever<00:03:35.700> done

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
don't think Eddie protoss has ever done

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.250 
don't think Eddie protoss has ever done
this<00:03:36.000> before<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.750> literally<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
this before like literally in the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.810 
this before like literally in the
history<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.560> starcraft<00:03:38.010> i<00:03:38.130> don't<00:03:38.340> think<00:03:38.519> this

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
history of starcraft i don't think this

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.699 
history of starcraft i don't think this
has<00:03:38.880> ever<00:03:39.150> been<00:03:39.239> done<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.660> professional<00:03:40.230> leak

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
has ever been done the professional leak

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.680 
has ever been done the professional leak
before<00:03:40.920> DOOL<00:03:41.700> DOOL<00:03:42.000> nexus<00:03:42.570> before<00:03:42.989> before<00:03:43.950> um

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
before DOOL DOOL nexus before before um

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.880 
before DOOL DOOL nexus before before um
before<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.840> gateway<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.620> gonna<00:03:46.739> be

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
before a gateway and this is gonna be

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.830 
before a gateway and this is gonna be
terrible<00:03:47.190> i<00:03:47.519> think<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:47.910> hero<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.390> think

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
terrible i think for hero I think

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.150 
terrible i think for hero I think
there's<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:48.989> reason<00:03:49.320> why<00:03:49.410> no<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.680> does<00:03:49.829> this<00:03:50.010> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
there's a reason why no one does this is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.310 
there's a reason why no one does this is
because<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.940> disastrous<00:03:51.630> because<00:03:51.840> now

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
because it's a disastrous because now

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.050 
because it's a disastrous because now
minus<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.680> spot<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:53.280> might<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.640> actually

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
minus a spot of this might is actually

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.729 
minus a spot of this might is actually

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
coming and I have to say I'm gonna

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.539 
coming and I have to say I'm gonna
commentate<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.799> know<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.100> game<00:04:08.280> goes

commentate and you know this game goes

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.920 
commentate and you know this game goes
on<00:04:08.700> for<00:04:08.910> quite<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.120> bit<00:04:09.239> longer<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.660> I'm<00:04:09.810> going

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
on for quite a bit longer but I'm going

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.710 
on for quite a bit longer but I'm going
to<00:04:09.989> say<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.440> Gigi<00:04:10.980> for<00:04:11.370> hero<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.269> have<00:04:12.390> no

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
to say this is Gigi for hero I have no

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.300 
to say this is Gigi for hero I have no
idea<00:04:12.750> how<00:04:13.019> he<00:04:13.109> expects<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.680> win<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:13.950> game<00:04:14.100> now

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
idea how he expects to win this game now

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.969 
idea how he expects to win this game now
because<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.450> factory<00:04:15.810> push<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.200> very<00:04:16.709> strong

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
because a to factory push is very strong

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.240 
because a to factory push is very strong
against<00:04:17.370> even<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.789> 14<00:04:18.570> nexus<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.709> general<00:04:20.130> it

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
against even a 14 nexus in general it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.890 
against even a 14 nexus in general it
wins<00:04:20.519> against<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.910> 14<00:04:21.180> Nexus<00:04:21.450> unless<00:04:21.720> there's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
wins against of 14 Nexus unless there's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.110 
wins against of 14 Nexus unless there's
some<00:04:22.019> very<00:04:22.260> very<00:04:22.470> good<00:04:22.590> micro<00:04:23.160> or<00:04:23.370> some<00:04:23.550> very

some very very good micro or some very

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.969 
some very very good micro or some very
good<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.810> know<00:04:24.930> Dragoon<00:04:25.470> her<00:04:25.650> honest<00:04:25.860> or

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
something like that not ruin her ass but

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.270 
something like that not ruin her ass but

very good trigger micro by the Protoss

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.970 
very good trigger micro by the Protoss

but after going to nexuses hero is not

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.560 
but after going to nexuses hero is not
only<00:04:32.160> going<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.580> farther<00:04:32.940> behind<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.360> tech

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
only going to be farther behind a tech

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.360 
only going to be farther behind a tech
he's<00:04:33.750> also<00:04:33.930> not<00:04:34.260> going<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.980> able<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.220> even

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
he's also not going to be able to even

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.070 
he's also not going to be able to even
get<00:04:35.610> an<00:04:35.700> advantage<00:04:36.060> from<00:04:36.330> hanging<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.720> nexus

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
get an advantage from hanging to nexus

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.120 
get an advantage from hanging to nexus
because<00:04:37.290> he<00:04:37.380> simply<00:04:37.680> won't<00:04:37.770> have<00:04:37.920> enough

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
because he simply won't have enough

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.650 
because he simply won't have enough
probes<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.610> make<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.760> difference<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.270> mean<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
probes to make a difference I mean the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.510 
probes to make a difference I mean the
difference<00:04:39.690> between<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.260> double<00:04:40.860> Nexus<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.310> a

difference between a double Nexus and a
triple<00:04:41.850> Nexus<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.360> almost<00:04:42.840> marginal<00:04:43.380> because

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
triple Nexus is almost marginal because

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.290 
triple Nexus is almost marginal because
really<00:04:44.550> you're<00:04:44.700> not<00:04:44.880> going<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.090> have<00:04:45.180> enough

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
really you're not going to have enough

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.180 
really you're not going to have enough
probes<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.080> make<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> difference<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:47.070> know

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
probes to make a difference you know

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.560 
probes to make a difference you know
five<00:04:47.520> minutes<00:04:47.820> into<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.060> game<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.330> will<00:04:48.390> take

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
five minutes into the game it will take

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.030 
five minutes into the game it will take
maybe<00:04:48.750> even<00:04:48.960> 10<00:04:49.500> minutes<00:04:49.530> into<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.010> game

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
maybe even 10 minutes into the game

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.440 
maybe even 10 minutes into the game
before<00:04:50.280> you'd<00:04:50.580> feel<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.030> difference<00:04:51.330> between

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
before you'd feel the difference between

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.920 
before you'd feel the difference between
a<00:04:51.810> double<00:04:52.770> Nexus<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.460> triple<00:04:53.760> Nexus<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.300> mean

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
a double Nexus and a triple Nexus I mean

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.020 
a double Nexus and a triple Nexus I mean
this<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.080> like<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.800> make<00:04:55.920> an<00:04:56.040> Olympic<00:04:56.430> analogy

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
this is like to make an Olympic analogy

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.630 
this is like to make an Olympic analogy
like<00:04:57.270> if<00:04:57.420> someone<00:04:57.690> went<00:04:57.870> from<00:04:58.160> went<00:04:59.160> on<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.400> 10

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
like if someone went from went on the 10

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.000 
like if someone went from went on the 10
meter<00:04:59.850> high<00:05:00.180> dive<00:05:00.420> into<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:01.050> swimming<00:05:01.500> pool<00:05:01.650> and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
meter high dive into a swimming pool and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.800 
meter high dive into a swimming pool and
instead<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.580> doing<00:05:02.970> just<00:05:03.000> like<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.510> hardest

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
instead of doing just like the hardest

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.210 
instead of doing just like the hardest
routine<00:05:04.200> there<00:05:04.410> which<00:05:04.590> might<00:05:04.890> be<00:05:05.010> something

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
routine there which might be something

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.520 
routine there which might be something
like<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.460> triple<00:05:05.790> pike<00:05:06.150> with<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.780> double<00:05:07.200> double

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
like a triple pike with a double double

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.500 
like a triple pike with a double double
somersault<00:05:07.890> he<00:05:08.340> decided<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:09.150> know<00:05:09.240> that's

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
somersault he decided you know that's

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.600 
somersault he decided you know that's
too<00:05:09.720> easy<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:10.320> can't<00:05:10.770> win<00:05:11.040> unless<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.550> do

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
too easy I can't win unless I do

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.460 
too easy I can't win unless I do
something<00:05:11.790> like<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.210> quadruple<00:05:12.960> pike<00:05:13.230> with<00:05:13.440> a

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
something like a quadruple pike with a

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.260 
something like a quadruple pike with a
triple<00:05:13.860> somersault<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.820> middle<00:05:15.030> I'll<00:05:15.120> do

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
triple somersault and the middle I'll do

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.690 
triple somersault and the middle I'll do
like<00:05:15.510> a<00:05:15.810> little<00:05:16.110> Flying<00:05:16.770> V<00:05:16.890> shape<00:05:17.520> or

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
like a little Flying V shape or

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.460 
like a little Flying V shape or
something<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.150> then<00:05:18.270> now<00:05:18.420> you<00:05:19.230> know<00:05:19.320> also

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
something and then now you know also

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.010 
something and then now you know also
make<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> smiley<00:05:20.130> face<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:21.630> would<00:05:21.750> be<00:05:21.840> my

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
make a smiley face and that would be my

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.570 
make a smiley face and that would be my
thing<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.530> difficulty<00:05:22.950> level<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.340> like

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
thing and the difficulty level is like

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.030 
thing and the difficulty level is like
you<00:05:24.150> know<00:05:24.240> double<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.260> next<00:05:25.740> hardest

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
you know double that of the next hardest

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.500 
you know double that of the next hardest
competitor<00:05:26.430> but<00:05:26.850> then<00:05:27.000> he<00:05:27.150> just<00:05:27.330> totally

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
competitor but then he just totally

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.540 
competitor but then he just totally
fails<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:28.050> mean<00:05:28.080> he<00:05:28.290> just<00:05:28.320> belly<00:05:28.770> flops<00:05:29.130> he<00:05:29.310> just

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
fails I mean he just belly flops he just

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.710 
fails I mean he just belly flops he just
tries<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:29.940> do<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.210> he<00:05:30.300> ends<00:05:30.450> up<00:05:30.480> with<00:05:30.600> this

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
tries to do and he ends up with this

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.810 
tries to do and he ends up with this
face<00:05:31.050> in<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.470> water<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.980> this<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.490> think<00:05:32.700> it's

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
face in the water and this I think it's

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.130 
face in the water and this I think it's
what's<00:05:32.940> gonna<00:05:33.000> happen<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.420> hero<00:05:33.630> basically<00:05:34.080> is

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
what's gonna happen a hero basically is

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.390 
what's gonna happen a hero basically is
going<00:05:34.320> for<00:05:34.500> something<00:05:34.650> that's<00:05:34.890> incredibly

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
going for something that's incredibly

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.760 
going for something that's incredibly
difficult<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.690> not<00:05:37.110> going<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.350> work<00:05:37.410> and

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
difficult and just not going to work and

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.290 
difficult and just not going to work and
i<00:05:37.890> think<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.190> good<00:05:38.310> reason<00:05:38.490> for<00:05:38.670> it<00:05:38.820> here<00:05:39.210> we

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
i think is a good reason for it here we

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.720 
i think is a good reason for it here we
see<00:05:39.450> siege<00:05:39.720> mode<00:05:39.900> already<00:05:40.230> up<00:05:40.620> for<00:05:40.920> midas<00:05:41.100> he's

see siege mode already up for midas he's

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.400 
see siege mode already up for midas he's
