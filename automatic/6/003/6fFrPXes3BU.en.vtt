00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.090
 colored dust like the ones they use in 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.830
 the school of rum and all things 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:17.000
 my result was this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.000
 here can be oblivion is yellow 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.990

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.330
 a little more 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:32.290
 Pedroso but it serves like the other mole 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.470
 well what we will need will be a 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.900
 clean cup 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.329
 three spoons 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.820
 white flour 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.570
 with prayers 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.540
 a defender 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.090
 one 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.760
 a plastic cup or a container where 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.520
 we can mix everything first 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.550
 we will do it will be to throw three spoonfuls 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.450
 great would be to our recipient or 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450
 festive glasses 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.050
 then 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.159
 in our clean cup 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.740
 we will pour some water 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.450
 and the coloring that we said in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.450
 this one color case 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.230
 in this orange box that is in 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.230
 the rocks 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.600
 about six or seven yellow 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.100
 and after that with another spoon mix 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.100
 the colors 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.000
 seers the color that you wanted 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.850
 it turns out that 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.650
 when your coherent in water is ready 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.650
 I will fight in your glass 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 all 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.160
 remember not to do much 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.750
 with the other spoon 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.509
 will begin to stir 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.840
 until a base is made if it is that 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.470
 lack of flour and you must make a 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.400
 mass as well as those you do for those who 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.400
 they are things like that 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.320
 and I already have a list 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.510
 we will put it on top of a bag and 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.370
 we will throw flour so that we are not 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.890
 be stuck in the hands 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.549
 with the humerus they crushed the dough 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.140
 that is fine has not refined possible 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:43.599
 they can help themselves with flour so that 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.599
 they stay or durero in its mass 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.950
 then the resulting mass should leave it 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.200
 well but outdoors until you're 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.290
 dry when it is dry, the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.780
 bits and they will let it dry for a day 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.730
 plus 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.250
 is to leave something like this this is not 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.720
 totally dry if you see are places 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.530
 darker when you are ready the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.530
 they can throw their husband in his grinder 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.530
 your 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.530
 a few seconds until it has decomposed 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.360
 list will not always remain as a 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.360
 prize
