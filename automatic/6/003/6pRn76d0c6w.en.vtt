dedicated to that notice to give you an
idea<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.620> was<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.250> thinkpad<00:02:35.519> user<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> long

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
idea I was a thinkpad user for a long

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.330 
idea I was a thinkpad user for a long
time<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.599> track<00:02:37.230> point<00:02:37.470> seems<00:02:37.739> incredibly

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
time this track point seems incredibly

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.850 
time this track point seems incredibly
firm<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> does<00:02:39.959> come<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.319> separated

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
firm so it does come with the separated

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.220 
firm so it does come with the separated
buttons<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.209> feel<00:02:42.630> as

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
buttons here that you do not feel as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.199 
buttons here that you do not feel as
good<00:02:43.590> as<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> thinkpad

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
good as what we have on the thinkpad

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.559 
good as what we have on the thinkpad
they're<00:02:45.690> very<00:02:46.230> small<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.910> how<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.239> push<00:02:48.540> down

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
they're very small in how you push down

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.420 
they're very small in how you push down
on<00:02:48.780> them<00:02:49.140> there<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.470> not<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.769> lot<00:02:49.829> of<00:02:49.980> travel

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
on them there are not a lot of travel

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.610 
on them there are not a lot of travel
there<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.269> don't<00:02:51.450> feel<00:02:51.690> very<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:52.440> feel

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
there and I don't feel very they feel

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.979 
there and I don't feel very they feel
they<00:02:52.769> feel<00:02:52.950> kind<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.190> crappy<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:54.810> have

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
they feel kind of crappy so then we have

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.720 
they feel kind of crappy so then we have
the<00:02:55.140> full<00:02:55.380> size<00:02:55.590> trackpad<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.400> does<00:02:56.549> feel

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the full size trackpad that does feel

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.300 
the full size trackpad that does feel
pretty<00:02:56.790> nice<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.530> page<00:02:58.799> up<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.069> down

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
pretty nice we have page up and down

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.039 
pretty nice we have page up and down
which<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.670> always<00:02:59.790> good<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.090> see<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:00.900> as

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
which is always good to see and then as

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.099 
which is always good to see and then as
for<00:03:01.290> ports<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> side<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.639> USB<00:03:02.970> 3.0<00:03:03.540> size

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
for ports on the side to USB 3.0 size

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.069 
for ports on the side to USB 3.0 size
ethernet<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.280> think<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
ethernet and then I think that is the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.349 
ethernet and then I think that is the
psu<00:03:07.079> there<00:03:07.319> on<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.650> side<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:09.000> was<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
psu there on this side so it was just a

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.309 
psu there on this side so it was just a
quick<00:03:09.720> hands-on<00:03:10.319> with<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.620> toshiba<00:03:11.750> z20<00:03:12.750> t

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
quick hands-on with the toshiba z20 t

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.710 
quick hands-on with the toshiba z20 t
again<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> 12.5<00:03:14.819> device<00:03:15.269> running<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:15.900> em

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
again a 12.5 device running for em

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.300 
again a 12.5 device running for em
because<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.320> two<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.680> wonder<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
because it is a two and wonder the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.130 
because it is a two and wonder the
tablet<00:03:18.700> actually<00:03:19.150> does<00:03:19.300> include<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.720> camera

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
tablet actually does include a camera

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.780 
tablet actually does include a camera
which<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.410> pretty<00:03:20.590> good<00:03:20.830> one<00:03:21.490> of<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.640> things

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
which is pretty good one of the things

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.760 
which is pretty good one of the things
that<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:22.270> failed<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.660> mention<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.260> what

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
that I have failed to mention is what

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.830 
that I have failed to mention is what
kind<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:23.980> options<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.580> have<00:03:24.610> form<00:03:25.210> hard<00:03:25.510> drive

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
kind of options you have form hard drive

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.580 
kind of options you have form hard drive
it<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.620> comes<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:26.890> up<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.220> 82<00:03:27.550> bytes<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.910> ram<00:03:28.210> and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
it so comes it up to 82 bytes of ram and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.770 
it so comes it up to 82 bytes of ram and
128<00:03:29.590> 256<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:31.240> 512<00:03:32.040> SSD<00:03:33.040> options<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.600> this<00:03:34.750> is

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
128 256 and 512 SSD options so this is

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.620 
128 256 and 512 SSD options so this is
