00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.430
 really 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.730
 some shepherds said to each other 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.939
 let's go then until January 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.960
 and let's see what happened 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.140
 and what the Lord has shown us 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.300
 Dear brothers and sisters 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.460
 it's Christmas again 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 two thousand years ago an angel appeared to announce a great 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.670
 joy to the poor nativity shepherds 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.650
 the night was filled with light 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.650
 while the angels announced in heaven the glory of God 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 and on earth the peace of men who believe in love 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 the hardness of the story we live 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.160
 try to press our heart 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860
 with an iron breastplate 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.890
 to end life 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 but how to resist the temptation to believe in the ad 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 that really God has entered the world 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.660
 that there is hope also for us 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.940
 as the shepherds ran in the night towards the grotto 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.830
 so too we 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.540
 in spite of everything 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.250
 we are seekers of joy 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.560
 maybe we lack the simplicity of the shepherds 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.210
 but the craving of the heart 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.670
 and the need for light 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 they are the same 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.970
 also to us the event has been announced to change this 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.640
 we too must walk to nativity scene 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.770
 to find an answer to the problems that drag our soul 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 the torments that today more brutally annoy society are of order 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.660
 economic 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.000
 all of a sudden we are threatened by a safety wind 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.300
 that shakes the foundations of every illusion of self-sufficiency 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.630
 the materialistic society 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 he discovers with horror his deepest fragility 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.280
 be poor or be able to be 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 it becomes for all there is a real possibility 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.590
 all this is just the outer sign 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 and a deeper poverty gisela 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.710
 we also discovered ourselves as shepherds in the night 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.559
 for the Franciscans who live in holy land 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.439
 the pilgrimage to nativity scene on Christmas night 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.559
 It is a dearest and precious tradition 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.709
 but this year more than ever 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.730
 we are sure that we are not the only ones looking for the child 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.679
 many pilgrims will be with us 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.909
 that together with the Bethlehem Christians of the Holy Land 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.349
 will join our businesses 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.859
 the voice of the shepherds resounds 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.069
 that invites you to get on the road 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.029
 let's go to Bethlehem 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.369
 I'm sure an unfinite crowd of invisible pilgrims 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.019
 the mysterious ways of the spirit 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.199
 will be launched with us to seek joy 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.889
 together we will find the helpless child 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.489
 in the cold of the grotto 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.289
 he is not afraid of being poor 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.979
 because it brings us the love of God 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.049
 In Christmas 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.529
 especially for this holy land 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.269

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.989
 with a simple heart 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.090
 the encounter with the child Jesus erase at all levels 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.949
 there is still hope for all 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.199
 from Bethlehem 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.279
