hardcore<00:01:19.229> playthrough<00:01:19.680> mainly<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> was

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hardcore playthrough mainly that was

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
hardcore playthrough mainly that was
kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> their<00:01:20.670> focus<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.240> their<00:01:21.390> purpose

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.580 
kind of their focus and their purpose
and<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.040> figured<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.880> thought<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> myself

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and so I figured I thought to myself

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.570 
and so I figured I thought to myself
what<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> could<00:01:25.950> take<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.310> type<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
plants and kind of make some type of

he just flops to the ground and maybe

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.700 
he just flops to the ground and maybe
you<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> him<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.229> finish<00:01:37.470> him<00:01:37.560> off

you just go up to him and finish him off

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200 
you just go up to him and finish him off
with<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.950> melee<00:01:38.280> weapon<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.759> something<00:01:39.090> along

those<00:01:39.450> lines<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> idea<00:01:40.710> i

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
those lines that's kind of the idea i

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.499 
those lines that's kind of the idea i
got<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:41.909> he<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.090> saying<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
got from here when he was saying you

not<00:01:45.060> sure<00:01:45.329> though<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.720> feature<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
not sure though this feature was in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
not sure though this feature was in
Skyrim<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> reason<00:01:47.040> why<00:01:47.100> i<00:01:47.159> say<00:01:47.369> i<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
Skyrim the reason why i say i think is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.249 
Skyrim the reason why i say i think is
that<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.420> definitely<00:01:48.630> remember<00:01:48.899> getting

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that I definitely remember getting

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
that I definitely remember getting
potions<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.740> say<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.189> poison<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.000> enemy

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
for 10 seconds or something but to be

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.920 
for 10 seconds or something but to be
completely<00:01:53.460> honest<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> guys<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.659> had<00:01:54.780> no

idea<00:01:54.960> however<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.549> if

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
idea however to use them I don't know if

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.219 
idea however to use them I don't know if
you're<00:01:56.729> Enys<00:01:56.939> were<00:01:57.119> supposed<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> tranq<00:01:58.079> them

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you're Enys were supposed to tranq them

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.870 
you're Enys were supposed to tranq them
or<00:01:58.380> something<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> always<00:01:59.520> assume<00:01:59.820> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
or something but I always assume that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
or something but I always assume that
you<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.509> your<00:02:00.659> arrows<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.590> whenever

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you put them on your arrows but whenever

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
you put them on your arrows but whenever
I<00:02:01.920> tried<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> figure<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.640> how<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I tried to figure out how to do that I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.929 
I tried to figure out how to do that I
couldn't<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.979> who<00:02:05.460> knows<00:02:05.520> maybe<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
couldn't do it so who knows maybe you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.180 
couldn't do it so who knows maybe you
were<00:02:06.030> supposed<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> press<00:02:06.689> X<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.259> press<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
were supposed to press X or press a and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.469 
were supposed to press X or press a and
you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.310> consume<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> was

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
you can consume them and that was

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.900 
you can consume them and that was
technically<00:02:09.929> using<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> poison<00:02:11.459> dude<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
technically using them to poison dude I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.500 
technically using them to poison dude I
have<00:02:12.060> no<00:02:12.270> clue<00:02:12.450> honestly<00:02:12.720> I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
have no clue honestly I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.789 
have no clue honestly I
was<00:02:13.599> one<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> more<00:02:13.959> confusing<00:02:14.349> things<00:02:14.620> I'm

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
was one of the more confusing things I'm

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.929 
was one of the more confusing things I'm
probably<00:02:14.950> making<00:02:15.129> an<00:02:15.370> ass<00:02:15.519> out<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.790> myself

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
probably making an ass out of myself

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.270 
probably making an ass out of myself
right<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.390> anyways<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.500> figured<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.250> that

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
right now anyways I figured that that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130 
right now anyways I figured that that
could<00:02:18.790> be<00:02:18.909> implemented<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.720> game<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.019> the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
could be implemented in the game but the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.710 
could be implemented in the game but the
focus<00:02:20.439> here<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.799> traps<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.579> think<00:02:22.180> fall<00:02:22.420> should

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
focus here is traps I think fall should

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.479 
focus here is traps I think fall should
have<00:02:22.840> some<00:02:23.049> cool<00:02:23.290> gadget<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.069> traps

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
have some cool gadget like traps

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
could do one of those things where you

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.190 
could do one of those things where you
you<00:02:39.250> kind<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.519> like<00:02:39.670> dig<00:02:39.879> a<00:02:39.909> pit<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.599> your

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
you kind of like dig a pit and you your

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.690 
you kind of like dig a pit and you your
enemy<00:02:41.470> falls<00:02:41.739> in<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> pit<00:02:42.159> or<00:02:42.280> something<00:02:42.579> like

that<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.150> seems<00:02:43.629> like<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.870> little<00:02:44.079> too<00:02:44.200> much

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
that that seems like a little too much

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.199 
that that seems like a little too much
with<00:02:44.530> some<00:02:44.709> simple<00:02:44.920> stuff<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.310> bear<00:02:45.849> traps

with some simple stuff like bear traps
along<00:02:46.420> those<00:02:46.780> lines<00:02:47.109> would<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.310> cool

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
along those lines would be really cool

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.569 
along those lines would be really cool
along<00:02:49.329> with<00:02:49.359> actually<00:02:50.290> poisoning<00:02:50.890> your<00:02:51.040> your

weapon<00:03:06.430> customization<00:03:06.609> in<00:03:07.389> this<00:03:08.230> game<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.680> I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
weapon customization in this game and I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.300 
weapon customization in this game and I
felt<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.629> was<00:03:10.690> worth<00:03:11.139> mentioning

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
felt that this was worth mentioning

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.770 
felt that this was worth mentioning

because Matthew bellomont here as you
see<00:03:13.810> adds<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.859> this<00:03:14.980> by<00:03:15.159> saying<00:03:15.370> like<00:03:15.670> thermal

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
see adds to this by saying like thermal

iron<00:03:18.400> sights<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:18.879> we<00:03:19.000> discussed<00:03:19.389> iron<00:03:19.629> sights

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
iron sights now we discussed iron sights

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.319 
iron sights now we discussed iron sights
any<00:03:20.290> last<00:03:20.829> episode<00:03:21.430> but<00:03:21.849> i<00:03:21.910> figured<00:03:22.299> that

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
any last episode but i figured that

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.610 
any last episode but i figured that
scopes<00:03:22.750> were<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.989> whole<00:03:23.199> different<00:03:23.530> breed

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
scopes were a whole different breed

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.470 
scopes were a whole different breed
because<00:03:24.250> i<00:03:24.280> feel<00:03:24.519> like<00:03:24.669> those<00:03:24.849> alone<00:03:25.239> should

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
because i feel like those alone should

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.030 
because i feel like those alone should
be<00:03:25.569> customizable<00:03:26.230> as<00:03:26.349> well<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.799> i<00:03:26.829> don't<00:03:26.980> know

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
be customizable as well and i don't know

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.319 
be customizable as well and i don't know
why<00:03:27.220> i<00:03:27.250> didn't<00:03:27.519> cross<00:03:27.639> my<00:03:27.819> mind<00:03:27.849> when<00:03:28.180> i<00:03:28.209> was

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
why i didn't cross my mind when i was

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.300 
why i didn't cross my mind when i was
talking<00:03:28.690> about<00:03:28.780> iron<00:03:29.139> sights<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:29.889> i<00:03:29.949> figured

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
talking about iron sights but i figured

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.670 
talking about iron sights but i figured
to<00:03:30.340> myself<00:03:30.790> i<00:03:30.940> think<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.480> an<00:03:31.599> awesome<00:03:32.139> kick-ass

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
to myself i think of an awesome kick-ass

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.800 
to myself i think of an awesome kick-ass
rare<00:03:33.010> weapon<00:03:33.459> like<00:03:33.669> the<00:03:33.790> all-american<00:03:33.970> super

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
rare weapon like the all-american super

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.479 
rare weapon like the all-american super
strong<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.109> everything<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.160> got<00:03:36.310> this

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
strong and everything but it's got this

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.970 
strong and everything but it's got this
obnoxious<00:03:36.760> scope<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.049> then<00:03:38.379> it<00:03:38.650> makes<00:03:38.799> you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
obnoxious scope on it then it makes you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.400 
obnoxious scope on it then it makes you
zoom<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.579> far<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.599> got<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.870> crazy

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
zoom in so far and it's got the crazy

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.650 
zoom in so far and it's got the crazy
reticle<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> I'd<00:03:42.639> love<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.299> just<00:03:43.419> be<00:03:43.569> able

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
reticle in it I'd love to just be able

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.659 
reticle in it I'd love to just be able
to<00:03:43.870> take<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.590> sucker<00:03:44.919> off<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.489> use

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
to take that sucker off and just use

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.970 
to take that sucker off and just use
iron<00:03:45.940> sights<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:46.810> yes<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.410> could<00:03:47.590> technically

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
iron sights so yes I could technically

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.129 
iron sights so yes I could technically
cut<00:03:48.310> categorize<00:03:48.819> this<00:03:49.000> as<00:03:49.060> more<00:03:49.750> weapon

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
cut categorize this as more weapon

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.259 
cut categorize this as more weapon
customization<00:03:50.290> but<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> think<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.879> idea<00:03:52.030> of

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
customization but I think the idea of

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.180 
customization but I think the idea of
different<00:03:53.109> weapons<00:03:53.500> would<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.739> cool<00:03:54.010> because

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
different weapons would be cool because

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.069 
different weapons would be cool because
there<00:03:54.549> should<00:03:54.579> be<00:03:55.030> red<00:03:55.209> dots<00:03:55.449> there<00:03:55.690> should<00:03:55.930> be

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
there should be red dots there should be

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.990 
there should be red dots there should be
holographic<00:03:56.530> sights<00:03:56.980> there<00:03:57.159> should<00:03:57.340> be<00:03:57.459> a<00:03:57.609> cog

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
holographic sights there should be a cog

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.839 
holographic sights there should be a cog
there<00:03:58.480> are<00:03:58.659> thermal<00:03:59.079> sights<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.440> fallout<00:03:59.849> but

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
there are thermal sights in fallout but

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.059 
there are thermal sights in fallout but
um<00:04:01.060> someone<00:04:01.900> else<00:04:02.079> also<00:04:02.349> recommended<00:04:02.980> i

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
um someone else also recommended i

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.589 
um someone else also recommended i
forgot<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.609> screenshot<00:04:04.090> but<00:04:04.269> someone<00:04:04.510> else

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
forgot the screenshot but someone else

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.569 
forgot the screenshot but someone else
also<00:04:04.870> recommended<00:04:05.409> like<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> special<00:04:06.159> site<00:04:06.370> for

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
also recommended like a special site for

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.069 
also recommended like a special site for
fault<00:04:06.790> where<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.090> can<00:04:07.239> see<00:04:07.389> heavily

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
fault where you can see heavily

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.960 
fault where you can see heavily
irradiated<00:04:08.290> areas<00:04:09.280> i<00:04:09.430> think<00:04:09.639> that<00:04:09.790> would<00:04:09.879> be

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
irradiated areas i think that would be

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.719 
irradiated areas i think that would be
so<00:04:10.299> cool<00:04:10.329> to<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.319> fallout<00:04:11.560> kind<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.430> scope

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
so cool to see and fallout kind of scope

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:14.670 
so cool to see and fallout kind of scope
out<00:04:12.879> your<00:04:12.909> area<00:04:13.299> what's<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.900> best<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.440> safe

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
out your area what's the best and safe

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.259 
out your area what's the best and safe
path<00:04:14.979> to<00:04:15.220> take<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.430> keep<00:04:15.729> your<00:04:15.909> player<00:04:16.090> from

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
path to take to keep your player from

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.960 
path to take to keep your player from
getting<00:04:16.510> no<00:04:16.630> less<00:04:17.380> radiated<00:04:18.070> i<00:04:18.220> think<00:04:18.849> it's<00:04:18.940> a

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
getting no less radiated i think it's a

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.399 
getting no less radiated i think it's a
really<00:04:19.120> cool<00:04:19.359> idea<00:04:19.479> but<00:04:19.720> yeah<00:04:20.049> scope

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
really cool idea but yeah scope

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.990 
really cool idea but yeah scope
customization<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.250> something<00:04:21.909> that

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
customization is something that

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.670 
customization is something that
definitely<00:04:22.360> needs<00:04:22.659> to<00:04:22.870> be<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.229> next<00:04:23.409> fall

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
definitely needs to be in the next fall

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
strengths you combine them like there's

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.480 
strengths you combine them like there's
a<00:05:19.780> way<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:19.930> pick<00:05:20.230> up<00:05:20.260> items<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:21.010> then<00:05:21.040> combine

a way to pick up items and then combine

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.730 
a way to pick up items and then combine
them<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.910> then<00:05:22.360> drop<00:05:22.630> them<00:05:22.810> again<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.530> put

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
them and then drop them again so you put

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.500 
them and then drop them again so you put

makes more sense listening with the
radio<00:05:56.740> on<00:05:57.130> um<00:05:57.480> but<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.690> thing<00:05:58.960> is<00:05:58.990> is<00:05:59.500> that

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
radio on um but the thing is is that

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.350 
radio on um but the thing is is that
when<00:06:00.130> you<00:06:00.250> think<00:06:00.550> back<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.790> like<00:06:00.940> fall<00:06:01.120> through

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
normal humans relax a little bit and i

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.680

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
think that would be very cool to see but

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.750 
think that would be very cool to see but
yeah<00:06:28.960> that<00:06:29.230> is<00:06:29.440> a<00:06:29.470> really<00:06:29.800> good<00:06:30.040> suggestion

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
yeah that is a really good suggestion
