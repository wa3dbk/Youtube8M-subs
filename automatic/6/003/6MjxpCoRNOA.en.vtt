00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
well that intersects with the red that's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759 
well that intersects with the red that's
gonna<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> spot<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.140> guys<00:00:28.529> need<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
look at most of the time so to do a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.549 
look at most of the time so to do a
Celtic<00:00:32.160> knot<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:33.120> need<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.350> many

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
Celtic knot you need to see how many

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
Celtic knot you need to see how many
times<00:00:34.860> everything<00:00:35.280> intersects<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.450> what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
times everything intersects like what

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
times everything intersects like what
intersects<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> least<00:00:37.829> amount<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.280> times<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
intersects the least amount of times in

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.110 
intersects the least amount of times in
this<00:00:39.420> puzzle<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.559> red<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.190> gray<00:00:41.520> intersect

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this puzzle the red and gray intersect

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
this puzzle the red and gray intersect
four<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> blue<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> gray<00:00:43.559> intersect

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
four and the blue and gray intersect

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.190 
four and the blue and gray intersect
four<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> doesn't<00:00:45.420> matter<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
four so it doesn't matter which one you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
four so it doesn't matter which one you
choose<00:00:47.210> it's<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> only<00:00:48.780> way<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
choose it's a really the only way I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
choose it's a really the only way I
found<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.309> go

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
found out how to do it which you can go

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.540 
found out how to do it which you can go
pretty<00:00:50.760> fast<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.620> click<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.340> keep

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
pretty fast actually you click you keep

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
pretty fast actually you click you keep
one<00:00:53.820> spot<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:54.690> green<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
one spot the one that's green at the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
one spot the one that's green at the
bottom<00:00:55.530> left<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.370> pay<00:00:56.579> attention<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bottom left you just pay attention to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
bottom left you just pay attention to
that<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.609> now<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.910> both<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that and so right now they both have a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.830 
that and so right now they both have a
death<00:01:00.600> rune<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:02.070> gonna<00:01:02.250> end<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:03.449> changing

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
death rune so I'm gonna end up changing

death rune so I'm gonna end up changing
the<00:01:04.199> red<00:01:04.470> ones<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.489> keep<00:01:05.820> moving

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the red ones like I'm gonna keep moving

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.149 
the red ones like I'm gonna keep moving
those<00:01:06.360> along<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.080> check<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> gray<00:01:07.680> ones<00:01:07.950> on

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
it so I'm gonna check to see if there's
any<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:10.979> death<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.490> runes<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.350> gray<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
any more death of runes on the gray and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.410 
any more death of runes on the gray and
there<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.280> gonna<00:01:14.369> bring<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> over

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320 

I'll<00:01:18.420> bring<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I'll bring that back that's only one so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
I'll bring that back that's only one so
just<00:01:21.930> click<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> click<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> arrow<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
just click the click and arrow on the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
just click the click and arrow on the
red<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.270> sure<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> click<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> same<00:01:25.200> one

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
red and make sure you click the same one

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.420 
red and make sure you click the same one
each<00:01:25.500> time<00:01:25.830> there's<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.700> soul<00:01:27.659> rune<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.250> see

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
each time there's a soul rune so I see

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.660 
each time there's a soul rune so I see
this<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> gray<00:01:31.670> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
this one right here for the gray but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.109 
this one right here for the gray but
that<00:01:32.790> only<00:01:32.909> matches<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.540> once<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> let's<00:01:35.880> see

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that only matches up once so let's see

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
that only matches up once so let's see
if<00:01:36.180> there's<00:01:36.329> any<00:01:36.479> more<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> gonna

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
if there's any more and there is gonna

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.910 
if there's any more and there is gonna
bring<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.159> around<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.650> pretty<00:01:40.650> much<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
bring that around so pretty much you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
bring that around so pretty much you
just<00:01:40.979> keep<00:01:41.250> doing<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> whole<00:01:41.909> time

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just keep doing this the whole time

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
just keep doing this the whole time
until<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:43.380> intersects<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> green

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
until all the intersects at the green

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.080 
until all the intersects at the green
and<00:01:45.200> or<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> mean<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> gray<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> red<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and or I mean the gray and red are the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
and or I mean the gray and red are the
same<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.110> check<00:01:49.290> air<00:01:49.530> rune<00:01:52.250> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
same so now I'm gonna check air rune it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
same so now I'm gonna check air rune it
doesn't<00:01:53.610> look<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:54.030> any<00:01:54.180> air<00:01:54.390> runes

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
doesn't look like there's any air runes

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.160 

you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.030 

you<00:03:04.160> just<00:03:04.340> keep<00:03:04.580> doing<00:03:04.849> this<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:06.920> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
you just keep doing this it's really the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.250 
you just keep doing this it's really the
only<00:03:07.160> way<00:03:07.430> I've<00:03:07.580> figured<00:03:08.239> out<00:03:08.510> how<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.780> do<00:03:09.050> it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
only way I've figured out how to do it

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.710 
only way I've figured out how to do it
and<00:03:10.099> another<00:03:10.430> thing<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:10.880> when<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.120> look<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.569> it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
and another thing is when you look at it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.580 
and another thing is when you look at it
don't<00:03:11.930> get<00:03:12.110> intimidated<00:03:12.890> at<00:03:13.099> how<00:03:13.370> weird<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.940> is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
don't get intimidated at how weird it is

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.930 
don't get intimidated at how weird it is
if<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.739> just<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.550> will<00:03:16.700> eventually

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
if you just do this it will eventually

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:27.420 
if you just do this it will eventually
work

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.080
