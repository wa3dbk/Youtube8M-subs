00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
common characteristics first of all it's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.220 
common characteristics first of all it's
their<00:00:41.450> extensive<00:00:42.450> ability<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.989> handling

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
through their hardware and software

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
through their hardware and software
secondly<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.560> open<00:00:50.130> operating

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
secondly they all have open operating

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
secondly they all have open operating
systems<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.330> that<00:00:51.660> allows<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.080> to<00:00:52.110> yourself

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
systems and that allows you to yourself

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
systems and that allows you to yourself
customize<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.970> mobile<00:00:54.330> experience<00:00:54.780> by

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
your choice and thirdly and perhaps most

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
your choice and thirdly and perhaps most
obvious<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.110> design<00:01:01.680> structure<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.760> all

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
obvious is the design structure they all

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.100 
obvious is the design structure they all
share<00:01:04.460> we<00:01:05.460> call<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> human<00:01:06.270> curvature

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
share we call it the human curvature

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.050 
share we call it the human curvature
design<00:01:07.590> framework<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.759> very

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
design framework and it's it's very

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.429 
design framework and it's it's very
apparent<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> look<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
apparent if you take a look at the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.170 
apparent if you take a look at the
film's<00:01:10.770> where<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.009> see<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.399> curvature<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
film's where you see the curvature and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.770 
film's where you see the curvature and
lines<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.820> consistent
