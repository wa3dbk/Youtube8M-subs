00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
hello welcome back in this video we are

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.950 
hello welcome back in this video we are
going<00:00:04.310> to<00:00:04.609> look<00:00:04.759> at<00:00:06.129> factorization<00:00:07.750> using<00:00:08.750> the

method call factor tree method find the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.450 
method call factor tree method find the
prime<00:00:16.070> factors<00:00:16.640> of<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:18.050> number<00:00:18.380> 72<00:00:21.040> here<00:00:22.040> we

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
prime factors of the number 72 here we

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.820 
prime factors of the number 72 here we
write<00:00:23.050> number<00:00:24.050> 72<00:00:24.940> to<00:00:25.940> start<00:00:26.210> with<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:27.710> is

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
write number 72 to start with and it is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.340 
write number 72 to start with and it is
a<00:00:27.860> comp<00:00:28.220> site<00:00:28.520> number<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.750> we<00:00:29.900> will<00:00:29.960> put<00:00:30.320> the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
a comp site number so we will put the

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.150 
a comp site number so we will put the
rectangular<00:00:31.090> around<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.210> number<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.040> try<00:00:34.040> to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
rectangular around the number and try to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.680 
rectangular around the number and try to
find<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.850> factors<00:00:35.360> for<00:00:36.260> number<00:00:36.590> 72<00:00:37.329> so<00:00:38.329> it<00:00:38.420> can

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
find the factors for number 72 so it can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.690 
find the factors for number 72 so it can
be<00:00:39.520> number<00:00:40.520> two<00:00:41.350> times<00:00:42.970> 672<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.950> 12<00:00:45.950> is<00:00:46.160> again

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
be number two times 672 and 12 is again

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
be number two times 672 and 12 is again
a<00:00:46.880> composite<00:00:47.450> number<00:00:47.829> so<00:00:48.829> we<00:00:49.010> put<00:00:49.309> a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
a composite number so we put a

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.870 
a composite number so we put a
rectangular<00:00:50.720> around<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.590> number<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.219> number

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
rectangular around the number and number

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.350 
rectangular around the number and number
six<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:53.660> also<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.500> composite<00:00:55.250> number<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:56.180> mean

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
six is also a composite number that mean

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.680 
six is also a composite number that mean
is<00:00:56.480> not<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.750> prime<00:00:57.170> number<00:00:57.200> yet<00:00:58.450> now<00:00:59.450> we<00:00:59.480> will

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
is not a prime number yet now we will

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.260 
is not a prime number yet now we will
try<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.870> find<00:01:00.230> factors<00:01:00.739> for<00:01:00.950> 12<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:01.790> it<00:01:01.879> can<00:01:02.090> be

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
try to find factors for 12 so it can be

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.550 
try to find factors for 12 so it can be
2<00:01:03.079> times<00:01:04.840> 6<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:07.179> 2<00:01:08.179> is<00:01:08.389> a<00:01:08.420> prime<00:01:08.810> number<00:01:08.840> we'll

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
2 times 6 and 2 is a prime number we'll

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.539 
2 times 6 and 2 is a prime number we'll
put<00:01:09.799> a<00:01:09.829> circle<00:01:10.130> around<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:10.789> six<00:01:11.780> days<00:01:11.990> again

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
put a circle around it six days again

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.379 
put a circle around it six days again
com<00:01:13.549> site<00:01:13.819> numbers<00:01:14.329> we<00:01:14.630> put<00:01:14.869> a<00:01:16.389> rectangular

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:17.389 
com site numbers we put a rectangular

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.889 
com site numbers we put a rectangular
cross<00:01:17.630> stick<00:01:17.869> around<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:18.469> number<00:01:19.569> and<00:01:20.569> we

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
cross stick around that number and we

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.069 
cross stick around that number and we
still<00:01:21.200> have<00:01:21.499> to<00:01:21.770> find<00:01:22.369> factors<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:23.119> six<00:01:23.420> but

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
still have to find factors for six but

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.899 
still have to find factors for six but
two<00:01:24.319> is<00:01:24.469> already<00:01:24.889> a<00:01:24.920> prime<00:01:25.249> number<00:01:25.279> we<00:01:25.759> can

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
two is already a prime number we can

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.109 
two is already a prime number we can
stop<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:26.659> branching<00:01:27.319> here<00:01:27.889> and<00:01:28.159> but<00:01:28.849> this

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
stop this branching here and but this

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.800 
stop this branching here and but this
branch<00:01:29.479> will<00:01:30.020> still<00:01:30.799> follow<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:31.429> then<00:01:31.810> six

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
branch will still follow and then six

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.389 
branch will still follow and then six
can<00:01:33.079> be<00:01:33.229> written<00:01:33.909> s2<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:35.209> a<00:01:35.270> prime<00:01:35.990> number

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
can be written s2 is a prime number

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.899 
can be written s2 is a prime number
times<00:01:37.399> three<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.469> again<00:01:39.469> prime<00:01:39.799> numbers<00:01:40.310> so

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
times three is again prime numbers so

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.710 
times three is again prime numbers so
this<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.509> end<00:01:41.749> of<00:01:41.959> this<00:01:42.609> three<00:01:43.609> branches

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.310 

and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.740> six<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.820> six<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:52.080> be

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
and then we have six here six can be

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.980 
and then we have six here six can be
further<00:01:53.540> factorized<00:01:54.540> into<00:01:54.810> two<00:01:55.170> numbers<00:01:55.640> to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
further factorized into two numbers to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.200 
further factorized into two numbers to
prime<00:01:57.990> number<00:01:58.500> x<00:01:59.340> 3<00:01:59.730> a<00:02:00.380> prime<00:02:01.380> number<00:02:01.410> d<00:02:02.210> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
prime number x 3 a prime number d so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.980 
prime number x 3 a prime number d so
that<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.630> finish<00:02:05.630> all<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> branches

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that is finish all the branches

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
that is finish all the branches
basically<00:02:07.770> digit<00:02:08.040> these<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> ends<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
basically digit these are the ends of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.880 
basically digit these are the ends of
all<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.630> branches<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.490> then<00:02:11.490> we<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.210> write

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
all the branches and then we can write

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.060 
all the branches and then we can write
72<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.130> terms<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.760> these<00:02:15.030> prime<00:02:15.750> factors<00:02:16.260> equal

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
72 in terms of these prime factors equal

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:30.130 
72 in terms of these prime factors equal
to<00:02:17.900> 2<00:02:18.900> x<00:02:19.380> 2<00:02:20.300> x<00:02:21.300> 3<00:02:22.550> 2<00:02:23.550> 2<00:02:23.940> 3<00:02:23.970> 2<00:02:24.930> 3<00:02:24.959> 2<00:02:26.990> times<00:02:27.990> 3<00:02:28.620> which
