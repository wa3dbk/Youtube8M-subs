complaining<00:01:07.070> isn't<00:01:07.430> enough<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.909> think<00:01:08.300> in

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
complaining isn't enough I think in

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.170 
complaining isn't enough I think in
Congress<00:01:09.350> what<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:09.680> are<00:01:09.860> more<00:01:10.490> likely<00:01:10.730> to<00:01:10.940> say

Congress what we are more likely to say

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.810

that<00:01:49.220> will<00:01:49.460> be<00:01:49.580> thrown<00:01:49.910> in<00:01:50.150> here<00:01:50.480> will

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
that will be thrown in here will

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.450
