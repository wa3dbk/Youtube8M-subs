through<00:01:50.060> episode<00:01:50.630> barracks<00:01:51.020> you

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
through episode barracks you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.980 
through episode barracks you
neutral<00:01:53.340> discern<00:01:53.580> capability<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.690> means

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
neutral discern capability which means

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.960 
neutral discern capability which means
that<00:01:55.230> one<00:01:55.590> track<00:01:55.890> goes<00:01:56.220> one<00:01:56.460> way<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> other
