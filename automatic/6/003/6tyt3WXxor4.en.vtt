00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.200
 born in oaxaca my family is from 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 jalisco and I'm in love with df is 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.590
 a place that I love is a city 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.060
 that I really enjoy because 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.070
 I am very attracted to the general 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.860
 big cities 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 I am an actor writer writer son many 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.340
 things I'm somebody very hesitant that is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 passionate and having fun living 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 so I think it does not close the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 possibilities I like to do and explore 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 everything there is out there of life for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 smile a little my life starts with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.470
 twitter checking twitter because the only 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.449
 way I have to open my eyes 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190
 I am a person who sleeps a lot 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 I have to sleep eight hours soon 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
 or feel bad usually at times a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.700
 day before I choose what I'm going to wear or 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.770
 but on the same day I suddenly feel 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.060
 it matters a lot the mood there 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.830
 times that one does not want to think about that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 get to ideas that you have to think about 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 to get more for what I do that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 I usually try to choose brands 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 choose clothes that are very combinable 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.130
 that you can put one thing with the other 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.630
 I am also very love to the designers 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.009
 Mexicans love to combine brands of 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 international carving at best with a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.290
 little of what we Mexicans do of something 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.990
 more handmade 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.160
 this and that's clothes that make me feel 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.650
 comfortable with what they can give in 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.030
 bicycle with which you can walk this 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.460
 I do not like to feel very 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.130
 notched I'm someone half- famed 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.410
 suddenly and something that can make me 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.990
 feel free but at the same time make me see 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.090
 well if the relationship you have in the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.110
 way I've seen my form and iu to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.270
 my days not the money show is pretty 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.370
 attached to actually suddenly I can 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.750
 go out the most tachos or because I'm going to 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.550
 get to my work and at work 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.869
 where they will fix me or will they 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.270
 speak what follows me is what you have 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.979
 to put but many times also one 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.380
 if you want to feel good and want to leave 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.600
 his house arranged then also of 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.910
 suddenly that has to do this many 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.350
 Sometimes I have events that I have parties 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.630
 to go after my calls after 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.940
 I work and I think also of 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.320
 It is suddenly important to be able to attract 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.510
 something that maybe aggregate demand 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.360
 a bag and it looks good or you close the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.190
 shirt you close the shirt and you wear 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.590
 over a sack that you can change the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.140
 tennis for some shoes 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.030
 and that I think it's best to have clothes 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.130
 that can be worn with all styles 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.120
 to 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.050
 and from the morning a breakfast to a 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.050
 event the night a cocktail
