about<00:00:06.540> Earth's<00:00:06.930> history

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
about Earth's history

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.709 
about Earth's history
now<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.670> Earth's<00:00:08.910> history<00:00:09.059> were<00:00:09.450> dealing

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
now the Earth's history were dealing

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.629 
now the Earth's history were dealing
with<00:00:09.750> such<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> huge<00:00:10.440> amount<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.830> time<00:00:11.040> we're

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
with such a huge amount of time we're

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.440 
with such a huge amount of time we're
dealing<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:12.090> four-and-a-half

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
dealing with about four-and-a-half

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.480 
dealing with about four-and-a-half
billion<00:00:12.840> years<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.769> need<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.040> take<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> time

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
billion years we need to take the time

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.029 
billion years we need to take the time
and<00:00:14.670> break<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.030> up<00:00:15.150> into<00:00:15.330> smaller<00:00:15.839> units

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
and break it up into smaller units

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.179 
and break it up into smaller units
called<00:00:17.039> eons<00:00:17.550> eras<00:00:18.359> periods<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.109> epochs<00:00:19.470> now

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
called eons eras periods and epochs now

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
called eons eras periods and epochs now
realize<00:00:20.490> when<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> these<00:00:21.119> time<00:00:21.449> units<00:00:21.840> end

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
realize when one of these time units end

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
realize when one of these time units end
and<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.740> begins<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.730> usually

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and the other one begins it's usually

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.839 
and the other one begins it's usually
based<00:00:24.240> upon<00:00:24.449> an<00:00:24.960> extinction<00:00:25.680> an<00:00:25.849> appearance

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
based upon an extinction an appearance

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.109 
based upon an extinction an appearance
or<00:00:27.180> maybe<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:29.160> sort<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.460> geologic<00:00:30.029> events

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
or maybe a some sort of geologic events

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.209 
or maybe a some sort of geologic events
that<00:00:30.480> might<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.689> taken<00:00:30.960> place<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that might have taken place like the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.660 
that might have taken place like the
breakup<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> Pangaea<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> realize<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.550> we're

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
breakup of Pangaea so realize when we're

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
breakup of Pangaea so realize when we're
dealing<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:35.940> these<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.050> time

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
dealing with these some of these time

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
dealing with these some of these time
units<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.219> multiple<00:00:38.850> millions

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
units are going to be multiple millions

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.990 
units are going to be multiple millions
of<00:00:39.300> years<00:00:39.570> old<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:41.399> isn't<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> major

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
of years old and there isn't a major

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
of years old and there isn't a major
event<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.480> causes<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.410> them<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> end<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
event that causes one of them to end in

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.369 
event that causes one of them to end in
another<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.700> begin<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.750> biggest<00:00:46.050> unit<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
another one to begin the biggest unit of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
another one to begin the biggest unit of
time<00:00:46.530> isn't<00:00:46.710> Eon<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
time isn't Eon that's going to be the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
time isn't Eon that's going to be the
largest<00:00:48.989> unit<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> time<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.340> two<00:00:50.579> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
largest unit at a time you have two of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.240 
largest unit at a time you have two of
them<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> Precambrian<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> phanerozoic

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
them the Precambrian in the phanerozoic

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
them the Precambrian in the phanerozoic
the<00:00:53.250> Precambrian<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.420> big<00:00:54.719> enough

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the Precambrian is actually big enough

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
the Precambrian is actually big enough
that<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.559> broken<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.250> sub

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that has to be broken up into two sub

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.459 
that has to be broken up into two sub
eons<00:00:57.030> called<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> archaea<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
eons called the archaea and the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.560 
eons called the archaea and the
Proterozoic<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> that's<00:01:00.120> very<00:01:00.359> simply

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
Proterozoic and that's very simply

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.240 
Proterozoic and that's very simply
because<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.989> Precambrian<00:01:01.590> makes<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.039> about

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
because the Precambrian makes up about

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.149 
because the Precambrian makes up about
85%<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:03.149> Earth's<00:01:03.359> history

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
85% of Earth's history

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.030 
85% of Earth's history
eons<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.369> broken<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.790> into<00:01:05.909> eras<00:01:06.920> second<00:01:07.920> Lord

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
eons are broken up into eras second Lord

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
eons are broken up into eras second Lord
soon<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.520> time<00:01:08.760> yeah<00:01:09.479> four<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> them<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
soon at a time yeah four of them the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.800 
soon at a time yeah four of them the
Precambrian<00:01:10.860> paleozoic<00:01:11.820> mesozoic<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
Precambrian paleozoic mesozoic and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.700 
Precambrian paleozoic mesozoic and
cenozoic

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
cenozoic

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.640 
cenozoic
and<00:01:14.299> again<00:01:15.299> there's<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:16.020> too<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and again there's just a lot too much to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.920 
and again there's just a lot too much to
list<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.130> podcast<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> Paleozoic

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
list in this podcast but the Paleozoic

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
list in this podcast but the Paleozoic
itself<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.530> important<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.460> when

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
itself is important because that's when

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
itself is important because that's when
oxygen<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.570> built<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> atmosphere

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
oxygen really built up in the atmosphere

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.480 
oxygen really built up in the atmosphere
or<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> broken<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.590> periods<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.310> are

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
or is a broken up it's periods these are

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
or is a broken up it's periods these are
probably<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> most<00:01:26.939> popular<00:01:27.180> unit<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> time

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
probably the most popular unit at a time

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
probably the most popular unit at a time
on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> region's<00:01:28.680> exam<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> there's<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.090> too

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
on the region's exam and there's way too

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.640 
on the region's exam and there's way too
many<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.659> list<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.140> sure<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.380> look<00:01:31.500> at

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
many to list but make sure you look at

it built up enough to where organisms

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.460 
it built up enough to where organisms

that's<00:03:24.230> found<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.709> British<00:03:25.640> Columbia<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
that's found in British Columbia and

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.180 
that's found in British Columbia and
there's<00:03:26.870> one<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.290> organisms<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:27.920> can<00:03:28.070> be

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
there's one of the organisms that can be

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.540 
there's one of the organisms that can be
found<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> burgess<00:03:29.120> shale<00:03:30.310> what<00:03:31.310> when<00:03:31.459> we

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
found in the burgess shale what when we

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.310 
found in the burgess shale what when we
talk<00:03:31.730> about<00:03:31.760> species<00:03:32.390> diversity<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:33.110> have<00:03:33.200> to

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
talk about species diversity we have to

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.110 
talk about species diversity we have to
realize<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.830> as<00:03:33.950> time<00:03:34.190> goes<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.550> species

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
realize that as time goes on species

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.970 
realize that as time goes on species
have<00:03:35.300> become<00:03:35.480> more<00:03:35.870> diverse<00:03:36.140> they've<00:03:36.739> become

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
have become more diverse they've become

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.160 
have become more diverse they've become
more<00:03:37.370> complex<00:03:37.880> as<00:03:38.060> well<00:03:38.270> but<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.050> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
more complex as well but you have to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.080 
more complex as well but you have to
realize<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.530> most<00:03:39.980> species<00:03:40.489> on<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.760> planet

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
realize that most species on the planet

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.850 
realize that most species on the planet
that<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:41.330> ever<00:03:41.600> lived<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.140> planet<00:03:42.350> have

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
that have ever lived on the planet have

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.580 
that have ever lived on the planet have
become<00:03:43.310> extinct<00:03:43.730> very<00:03:44.090> few<00:03:44.480> have<00:03:44.660> lasted<00:03:45.200> the

become extinct very few have lasted the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.690 
become extinct very few have lasted the
test<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:46.040> time<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:47.510> lot<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:48.380> idea<00:03:48.980> has

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
test of time and a lot of this idea has

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.310 
test of time and a lot of this idea has
to<00:03:49.880> be<00:03:49.940> linked<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.480> studies<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.989> Charles

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
to be linked to the studies of Charles

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.350 
to be linked to the studies of Charles
Darwin<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:52.010> basically<00:03:52.700> Darwin<00:03:53.209> just

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
Darwin and basically Darwin just

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.240 
Darwin and basically Darwin just
basically<00:03:53.660> stated<00:03:54.110> what<00:03:54.530> we<00:03:54.620> call<00:03:54.800> survival

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
basically stated what we call survival

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.490 
basically stated what we call survival
of<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.370> fittest<00:03:55.550> those<00:03:56.090> organisms<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:56.810> are

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
of the fittest those organisms that are

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.590 
of the fittest those organisms that are
really<00:03:57.830> strong<00:03:58.040> will<00:03:58.400> survive<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:59.150> length<00:03:59.420> of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
really strong will survive the length of

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.160 
really strong will survive the length of
time<00:04:00.760> now<00:04:01.760> these<00:04:01.940> pictures<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.600> fossils<00:04:03.050> are

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
time now these pictures of fossils are

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.509 
time now these pictures of fossils are
not<00:04:03.350> really<00:04:03.590> given<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:03.950> in<00:04:04.040> any<00:04:04.190> specific

not really given to you in any specific
order<00:04:04.940> but<00:04:05.570> realize<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:05.900> some<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.320> these

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
order but realize that some of these

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.280 
order but realize that some of these
fossils<00:04:06.890> are<00:04:07.040> more<00:04:07.400> complex<00:04:07.790> than<00:04:07.940> others

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
fossils are more complex than others

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.660 
fossils are more complex than others
very<00:04:09.290> simply<00:04:09.709> because<00:04:09.830> of<00:04:10.010> probably<00:04:10.459> when

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
very simply because of probably when

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.970 
very simply because of probably when
they<00:04:10.850> exactly<00:04:11.570> existed<00:04:12.110> some<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.830> more

they exactly existed some of the more

they exactly existed some of the more

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.530 
simple fossils that you're looking at
here<00:04:14.989> existed<00:04:15.830> in<00:04:15.980> much<00:04:16.310> earlier<00:04:16.760> time<00:04:16.850> the

here existed in much earlier time the
more<00:04:17.720> complex<00:04:18.019> fossils<00:04:18.560> lived<00:04:19.040> much<00:04:19.310> closer

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
more complex fossils lived much closer

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.600 
more complex fossils lived much closer

the theory of organic evolution which

about 65 million years ago well we talk
about<00:05:57.449> fossils<00:05:58.020> there's<00:05:58.169> one<00:05:58.439> specific<00:05:58.680> type

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
about fossils there's one specific type

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.740 
about fossils there's one specific type
of<00:05:59.159> fossil<00:05:59.639> that's<00:05:59.789> very<00:06:00.089> important<00:06:00.629> they're

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
of fossil that's very important they're

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.689 
of fossil that's very important they're
called<00:06:00.930> index<00:06:01.319> fossils<00:06:01.500> because<00:06:02.279> they<00:06:02.550> make

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
called index fossils because they make

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.309 
called index fossils because they make
what's<00:06:02.939> called<00:06:03.029> a<00:06:03.270> very<00:06:03.449> good<00:06:03.659> time<00:06:03.930> marker

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
what's called a very good time marker

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.559 
what's called a very good time marker
these<00:06:05.099> things<00:06:05.430> have<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.759> live<00:06:05.909> over<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.210> huge

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
these things have to live over a huge

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.719 
these things have to live over a huge
geographic<00:06:07.259> area<00:06:07.589> and<00:06:07.770> have<00:06:08.219> to<00:06:08.339> live<00:06:08.520> for<00:06:08.669> a

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
geographic area and have to live for a

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.519 
geographic area and have to live for a
relatively<00:06:09.330> short<00:06:09.449> period<00:06:09.839> of<00:06:10.259> time

relatively short period of time

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.010 
relatively short period of time
now<00:06:11.279> index<00:06:11.729> fossils<00:06:11.939> are<00:06:12.689> going<00:06:12.900> to<00:06:12.960> be

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
now index fossils are going to be

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.540 
now index fossils are going to be
fossils<00:06:13.439> that<00:06:13.469> are<00:06:13.560> can<00:06:13.740> be<00:06:13.770> found<00:06:14.039> in<00:06:14.189> one

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.760 
fossils that are can be found in one
distinct<00:06:15.000> layer<00:06:15.150> of<00:06:15.300> rock<00:06:15.539> so<00:06:16.259> you<00:06:16.349> can<00:06:16.560> see

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
distinct layer of rock so you can see

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.320 
distinct layer of rock so you can see
here<00:06:16.979> that<00:06:17.099> the<00:06:17.310> trial<00:06:17.699> of<00:06:17.819> I<00:06:17.909> at<00:06:18.089> the<00:06:18.210> bottom

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
here that the trial of I at the bottom

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.149 
here that the trial of I at the bottom
is<00:06:18.629> only<00:06:18.750> found<00:06:18.990> in<00:06:19.169> one<00:06:19.469> distinct<00:06:19.919> layer<00:06:20.069> of

is only found in one distinct layer of
rock<00:06:20.339> that<00:06:20.550> silt<00:06:20.789> stone<00:06:20.939> but<00:06:21.569> it's<00:06:21.659> found<00:06:21.870> in

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
rock that silt stone but it's found in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.740 
rock that silt stone but it's found in
all<00:06:22.289> four<00:06:22.740> locations<00:06:23.360> same<00:06:24.360> thing<00:06:24.509> with<00:06:24.659> these

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
all four locations same thing with these

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.290 
all four locations same thing with these
letters<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.740> letter<00:06:25.979> C<00:06:26.370> is<00:06:26.639> going<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.180> be

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
letters the letter C is going to be

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.050 
letters the letter C is going to be
representing<00:06:28.199> your<00:06:28.349> index<00:06:28.889> fossil<00:06:29.400> very

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
representing your index fossil very

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.939 
representing your index fossil very
simply<00:06:30.479> because<00:06:30.810> of<00:06:30.839> the<00:06:31.050> fact<00:06:31.259> it's<00:06:31.560> found<00:06:31.800> in

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
simply because of the fact it's found in

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.920 
simply because of the fact it's found in
one<00:06:32.190> distinct<00:06:32.550> layer<00:06:32.699> of<00:06:32.819> sandstone<00:06:33.270> and<00:06:33.539> it's

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
one distinct layer of sandstone and it's

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.209 
one distinct layer of sandstone and it's
found<00:06:34.110> in<00:06:34.259> all<00:06:34.529> three<00:06:35.219> locations

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
found in all three locations

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.100 
found in all three locations
volcanic<00:06:38.219> ash<00:06:38.610> is<00:06:38.849> also<00:06:39.269> a<00:06:39.299> very<00:06:39.689> very<00:06:39.929> good

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
volcanic ash is also a very very good

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.299 
volcanic ash is also a very very good
time<00:06:40.319> marker<00:06:40.739> as<00:06:40.860> well

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:41.309 
time marker as well

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.219 
time marker as well
there<00:06:41.849> is<00:06:41.999> simply<00:06:42.149> because<00:06:42.629> of<00:06:42.809> the<00:06:42.869> fact<00:06:43.110> that

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
there is simply because of the fact that

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.789 
there is simply because of the fact that
it's<00:06:43.499> distributed<00:06:44.219> over<00:06:44.399> a<00:06:45.360> very<00:06:46.169> very<00:06:46.559> big

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:46.799 
it's distributed over a very very big

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:49.519 
it's distributed over a very very big
geographic<00:06:47.429> area<00:06:47.759> and<00:06:47.969> it's<00:06:48.569> deposits<00:06:49.349> for<00:06:49.499> a

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
geographic area and it's deposits for a

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.029 
geographic area and it's deposits for a
relatively<00:06:50.009> short<00:06:50.309> period<00:06:50.789> of<00:06:50.849> time<00:06:50.909> so

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
relatively short period of time so

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.859 
relatively short period of time so
volcanic<00:06:53.039> ash<00:06:53.189> and<00:06:53.399> index<00:06:53.999> fossils<00:06:54.149> are<00:06:54.509> very

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:54.869 
volcanic ash and index fossils are very

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:58.309 
volcanic ash and index fossils are very
very<00:06:55.169> good<00:06:55.379> time<00:06:55.589> markers<00:06:56.659> so<00:06:57.659> the<00:06:57.959> big<00:06:58.110> thing

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 
very good time markers so the big thing

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.350 
very good time markers so the big thing
here<00:06:58.349> is<00:06:58.529> that<00:06:58.649> we<00:06:58.949> use<00:06:59.099> both<00:06:59.459> correlation<00:07:00.239> of

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
here is that we use both correlation of

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.839 
here is that we use both correlation of
you<00:07:00.629> both<00:07:00.899> use<00:07:01.169> your<00:07:01.649> index<00:07:01.979> fossils<00:07:02.129> and<00:07:02.639> your

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:02.849 
you both use your index fossils and your

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.609 
you both use your index fossils and your
volcanic<00:07:03.449> ash<00:07:03.599> to<00:07:03.839> correlate<00:07:04.319> rocks

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:04.619 
volcanic ash to correlate rocks

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:06.679 
volcanic ash to correlate rocks
correlation<00:07:05.579> just<00:07:05.759> means<00:07:05.939> to<00:07:06.149> match<00:07:06.329> up<00:07:06.569> your

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:06.689 
correlation just means to match up your

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.929 
correlation just means to match up your
rock<00:07:06.869> layers<00:07:07.139> so<00:07:07.949> scientists<00:07:08.429> do<00:07:08.729> what's

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
rock layers so scientists do what's

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.790 
rock layers so scientists do what's
called<00:07:09.089> walking<00:07:09.659> the<00:07:09.779> outcrop<00:07:10.169> they<00:07:10.379> look<00:07:10.619> for

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
called walking the outcrop they look for

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.919 
called walking the outcrop they look for
clues<00:07:11.039> in<00:07:11.189> Iraq<00:07:11.459> to<00:07:11.699> help<00:07:11.909> match<00:07:12.269> them<00:07:12.569> up<00:07:12.599> to

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:12.929 
clues in Iraq to help match them up to

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:14.600 
clues in Iraq to help match them up to
try<00:07:13.379> to<00:07:13.439> figure<00:07:13.769> out<00:07:13.860> if<00:07:14.039> they're<00:07:14.189> going<00:07:14.399> to<00:07:14.459> be

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
try to figure out if they're going to be

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.850 
try to figure out if they're going to be
is<00:07:14.849> very<00:07:14.879> similar<00:07:15.329> in<00:07:15.539> age<00:07:15.689> so<00:07:15.989> you<00:07:16.589> see<00:07:16.739> this

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
is very similar in age so you see this

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.619 
is very similar in age so you see this
road<00:07:17.159> cut<00:07:17.429> here<00:07:17.759> you<00:07:18.179> see<00:07:18.329> a<00:07:18.360> layer<00:07:18.599> of

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:18.629 
road cut here you see a layer of

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:20.479 
road cut here you see a layer of
sandstone<00:07:19.589> right<00:07:19.800> there<00:07:19.949> in<00:07:20.009> the<00:07:20.099> sack<00:07:20.279> in

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:20.489 
sandstone right there in the sack in

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.819 
sandstone right there in the sack in
this<00:07:20.639> in<00:07:20.849> the<00:07:20.969> two<00:07:21.360> sections<00:07:21.629> really<00:07:22.409> match<00:07:22.589> up

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:22.829 
this in the two sections really match up

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.850 
this in the two sections really match up
nicely<00:07:23.569> so<00:07:24.569> here<00:07:24.839> basically<00:07:25.289> we're<00:07:25.619> going<00:07:25.769> to

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:03.239 
outcrop a is going to be the youngest so

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:04.639 
outcrop a is going to be the youngest so
when<00:08:03.360> you<00:08:03.449> put<00:08:03.629> them<00:08:03.719> in<00:08:03.839> order<00:08:03.989> like<00:08:04.289> this<00:08:04.439> you

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:04.649 
when you put them in order like this you

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:07.399 
when you put them in order like this you
can<00:08:04.800> see<00:08:04.979> from<00:08:05.219> oldest<00:08:05.669> to<00:08:05.759> youngest<00:08:06.259> so<00:08:07.259> with

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:07.409 
can see from oldest to youngest so with

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.290 
can see from oldest to youngest so with
that<00:08:07.559> being<00:08:07.739> said<00:08:07.829> that<00:08:08.429> different<00:08:08.849> Earth's

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 
that being said that different Earth's

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.499 
that being said that different Earth's
history<00:08:09.539> will<00:08:09.989> talk<00:08:10.169> to<00:08:10.319> you<00:08:10.379> soon
