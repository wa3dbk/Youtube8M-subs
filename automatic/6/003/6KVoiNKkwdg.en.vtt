00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.280
Well I met with my team this morning. And I shared with them the news, that I've been

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.860
diagnosed with cancer in my left tonsil. I want everyone to know that number one this

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:27.440
a very very highly treatable disease that I have. I'm seeing the very best doctors if not in the United States in the world.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.660
I was told yesterday in Ann Arbor that the prognosis

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.100
for complete recover for this type of cancer is over ninety-percent.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.720
To me this is another opponent that, I'M GOING TO BEAT. We were on this thing very very quickly. From my initial

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.640
wronging signs to a final diagnosis was just over three weeks. So we've got a real good

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.590
jump on this a good handle on it. We know actually what it is and we know actually how to treat it.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.530
I feel great. If they did not
tell me I had this I wouldn't know.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.100
For the most part I've been symptom free, except for you know the thing that got our initial action was

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.740
a lump that developed on the left side of my neck. As far as football is considered

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.909
my interact will business as usual. Im going to be obviously going to be getting treatment

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.569
that going to cut into my time some what but outside of that I plan to keep a normal schedule

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.819
as far as the team is considered. I've got the best staff in the country. I'm convinced of that.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.299
These guys have been tremendous.
They're continue to be tremendous.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.500
I'm going to lean on them. They know I'm here, they know I'm not going anywhere and you know our standards,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.259
our expectations don't change one bit because of this. I cant wait until September third

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.099
when we kick off our season against Oklahoma State, here at Kelly/Shorts Stadium.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.760
I'm going to be there, I need you there. Fire Up Chips.
