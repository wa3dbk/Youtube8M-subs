another candle that I have out in my
family<00:00:25.260> room<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.859> been<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.160> quite

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
family room and it's been out for quite

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.950 
family room and it's been out for quite
a<00:00:26.580> while<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.420> trying<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> burn

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a while I was actually trying to burn

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.060 
a while I was actually trying to burn
through<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> during<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> Christmas<00:00:28.920> season

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
through it during the Christmas season

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.529 
through it during the Christmas season
and<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.730> didn't<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> put<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.390> back

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and I really didn't want to put it back

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
and I really didn't want to put it back
into<00:00:30.840> storage<00:00:31.439> because<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.040> don't<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.489> have

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
into storage because I don't really have

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.889 
into storage because I don't really have
that<00:00:32.669> much<00:00:32.850> left<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> feel<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> would

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
that much left and I feel like it would

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
that much left and I feel like it would
kind<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> waste<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> save<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.450> anyway

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
kind of be a waste to save it so anyway

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.000 
kind of be a waste to save it so anyway
I'm<00:00:36.870> trying<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.200> burn<00:00:37.350> through<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.800> I
