a<00:02:14.730> good<00:02:14.880> computer<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.440> went<00:02:16.680> with

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
a good computer this is what I went with

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
a good computer this is what I went with
keep<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.840> mind<00:02:18.990> when<00:02:19.230> you're<00:02:19.290> building

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
keep that in mind when you're building

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.210 
keep that in mind when you're building
things<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.760> start<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.450> look<00:02:21.570> really<00:02:21.900> good

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220

when you're building a computer and then

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.120 
when you're building a computer and then
you<00:02:24.900> gotta<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.380> gotta<00:02:25.560> keep<00:02:25.740> yourself

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you gotta you gotta keep yourself

you got one fan connector here that one
fan<00:03:22.880> connector<00:03:23.540> right<00:03:23.750> here<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.530> one<00:03:25.540> cpu<00:03:26.540> fan

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
fan connector right here and one cpu fan

fan connector right here and one cpu fan
connector<00:03:27.290> there<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.980> not<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> lot<00:03:28.460> of<00:03:28.670> options

as<00:03:29.210> far<00:03:29.240> as<00:03:29.480> fan<00:03:29.750> running<00:03:30.050> but<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:31.550> do<00:03:31.700> have

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
as far as fan running but we do have

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.220 
as far as fan running but we do have
molex<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.100> we're<00:03:34.100> good<00:03:35.050> because<00:03:36.050> we're

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
molex so we're good because we're

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.480 
molex so we're good because we're
probably<00:03:36.440> going<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.710> add<00:03:36.830> another<00:03:36.950> fan<00:03:37.310> on

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
probably going to add another fan on

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.540 
probably going to add another fan on
this<00:03:37.730> thing<00:03:38.050> because<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.080> is<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.440> cheaper<00:03:40.310> case

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
this thing because it is a cheaper case

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.390 
this thing because it is a cheaper case
since<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:42.170> know<00:03:42.260> kind<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.620> confined<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.250> want

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
since you know kind of confined we want

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.900 
since you know kind of confined we want

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
to 32 gigs which is awesome and I think

to 32 gigs which is awesome and I think
it's<00:03:59.800> 2133<00:04:00.800> is<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.070> max<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:03.230> capping<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:03.830> it

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
it's 2133 is the max the capping on it

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.190 
it's 2133 is the max the capping on it
isn't<00:04:04.370> bad<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:05.300> know<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.450> lot<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.989> higher

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
isn't bad you know a lot of the higher
