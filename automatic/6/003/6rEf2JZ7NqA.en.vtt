00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 but we change the subject to talk about the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.509
 recovery industry 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.189
 construction that is not like all the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.290
 world would like however a report 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.849
 indicates that the situation improves in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 some areas of the country like in denver 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 Aurora and I pronounce and as we will see in the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.539
 next report more construction 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.539
 It also means more jobs 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.390
 the good news 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.390
 the people of Colorado and the work is 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 all right 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 job opportunities in the industry 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.550
 of construction increased in large 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.860
 cities and metropolitan areas like 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.590
 denver aurora and bronze where 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.150
 They added 6 thousand 300 jobs according to a 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 report of the general association of 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:49.770
 contractors of the country I think this one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 is improving every day more because they have 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.440
 busy more new people and you look at yourself 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.109
 look in many parts of the city 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.269
 across the nation 166 areas 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.860
 metropolitan areas saw an increase in 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.110
 the number of constructions according to 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.509
 analysis based on information about 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.960
 jobs at the federal level went to languages 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.060
 that I personally feel blessed if 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 there would not be the job boom here I 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.409
 I think it would have to help me state 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.090
 and with the wife and children if he did not have 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.670
 work here I would have to go to the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.350
 oil industry over there in dakota 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.350
 from the north or something like that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.490
 bender aurora and brownfield saw a 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.470
 10% increase in your offers 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.220
 employment to construction employees 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.409
 exceeding six thousand jobs now 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.600
 I have many of my relatives who 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.549
 they live in the east moving here alone 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.979
 because there is work for this expert in 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.070
 economy the situation is perceived well there 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.630
 that value the life of this colorado 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.030
 has always brought many companies of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.100
 construction in the last 10 to 15 years 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 partly because of the weather conditions 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.659
 and the presence of workers 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.880
 experienced at all levels and it is 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.670
 that the hard blows of the crisis still 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 They feel this is a new job for me 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.790
 I 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.200
 I worked for 20 years for a company 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.270
 of construction that they just closed and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.040
 I barely have four months with this new 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.790
 company and obviously you can not 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.800
 still sing victory 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.900
 if it is growing but not as it was before 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.640
 go my companions are happy 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.410
 because they have a job that they can 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.940
 keep although there is the offer 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.740
 labor are few who can 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.660
 perform this difficult and heavy task and 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.280
 there is a lot of staff turnover because 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.770
 comes a lot of people who are not qualified 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.290
 and is that the work is not easy, you have to 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.450
 be out in the open in the sun 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.020
 rain in the snow there is no time to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.020
 rest
