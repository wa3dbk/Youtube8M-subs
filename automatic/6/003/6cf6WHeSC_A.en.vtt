like having a kind of window into

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
like having a kind of window into
someone<00:00:59.550> else's<00:00:59.820> brain<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.899> something

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
someone else's brain just something

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500 
someone else's brain just something
about<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.949> shows<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.059> mind<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510

actually<00:01:05.850> thinking<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:07.560> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
actually thinking and I think it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.670 
actually thinking and I think it's
better<00:01:07.950> even<00:01:08.400> than<00:01:08.549> an<00:01:08.729> MRI<00:01:09.030> scan<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:10.290> seeing

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
better even than an MRI scan at seeing

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.219 
better even than an MRI scan at seeing
inside<00:01:11.180> someone<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.630> seeing<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:13.049> they're

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
inside someone and seeing how they're

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
inside someone and seeing how they're
thinking<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> feeling<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
thinking and feeling and how the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.690 
thinking and feeling and how the
emotions<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> thoughts<00:01:16.340> exchange<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
emotions and the thoughts exchange and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.660 
emotions and the thoughts exchange and
kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> talk<00:01:18.390> between<00:01:19.259> each<00:01:19.380> other<00:01:19.670> I've

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
kind of talk between each other I've

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
kind of talk between each other I've
mentioned<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> sonnet<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
mentioned the sonnet but I think what I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.039 
mentioned the sonnet but I think what I
said<00:01:23.280> could<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.610> true<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.360> any<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
said could be true for any of the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.370 
said could be true for any of the
shorter<00:01:25.530> lyric<00:01:25.920> forms<00:01:26.340> certainly<00:01:27.259> once<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
shorter lyric forms certainly once you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.160 
shorter lyric forms certainly once you
start<00:01:28.590> getting<00:01:28.650> longer<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.780> into<00:01:30.780> another

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
start getting longer you're into another

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
start getting longer you're into another
kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> game<00:01:31.740> equally<00:01:32.189> important<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.939> can

you've got lots of texture lots of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.229 
you've got lots of texture lots of
layering<00:02:05.960> longer<00:02:06.960> poems<00:02:07.259> too<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.550> more
