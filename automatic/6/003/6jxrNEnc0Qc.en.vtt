 who crossed over from being towards Sicily and who points the ball is what has 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.820
 realized that chile is the second largest generator of sunamis worldwide 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.619
 He says 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.809
 in what was the 20th century just past 40% of all the destructive magnitude 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.800
 of 30 thousand of sun amy was sought attack our 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.669
 chilean yanelis we are a little unprotected in that matter but its

 uniform alejandro flores by fotocasa es 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.380
 Despite this, it confirms that our country is a model that leads the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.460
 in the face of criticism in fact the professor of physical geography of the university 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.510
 Catholic Marcelo Lagos points out that Chile its territory and exporter of its 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.400
 nose 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.760
 only in the 20th century 40% of the most destructive events in the world were 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.720
 originated national territory evidently east of japan chile 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.470
 see geology create sector and that indicates what earthquake is generated versus 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.110
 the coasts of our country with the characteristics a hygienic 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.400
 obviously with Homero epicentres with epicenter in the coasts with magnitudes 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.410
 higher than 8 in will be devastating earthquakes that generate sling of Sudan and 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.130
 that the intendant ravine the nearby coast but in turn they propagate in 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.450
 all directions from the origin zone attacking all coast of the basin 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.100
 on May 22, 1960 an earthquake of 6 9 with 5 degrees on the Richter scale 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.370
 shook santiago conception tie us two giant balls to admit options 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.380
 volcanic 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.300
 in that opportunity around five thousand people died and 2 million already to the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.230
 homeless 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.170
 shy 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.740
 the population in general 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.130
 Beyond the statistics that is done before Karen, I have to be 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 the puppet the statistics 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.970
 and beyond specific opinions you with irene collecting 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.820
 I grew up without going to the population 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.540
 enough more knowledge what not 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.330
 our country has 4 thousand 500 kilometers of coastline 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.150
 and only America has taken the necessary measures so that the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.770
 population know what to do in case of an earthquake and subsequent tsunami 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.020
 was to propagate cta simply give it a similar system in July 2005 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.540
 in the second semester 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 we will have installed until serena 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.240
 in fact around the sun 7 so to the coastal edge and that we are going to 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.319
 allow 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.309
 p warn at all times 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.969
 in such occurrences the monument is a habit to the population 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.069
 through a very special sound 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.409
 that this would go with some drills that are going to develop we will be able to 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.869
 it keeps all the population of the coastal edge in this city 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.349
 and that as such as the community we not only believe that it is prepared for 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.289
 that's what you need 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:35.529
 information about alonso that is the most important element in the sense 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:36.339
 of knowing 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.149
 that's why the security aunt that's why evacuation routes that's why the area 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.919
 security 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.189
 I've felt the community has a lack of information regarding the 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.909
 response plans to what counts has the city and kike 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.999
 very few cities and an example of this is the city and that you have to have in the 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.880
 king's management with tÃ©lam in osasuna b 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.670
 has integrated this instrument that in the flood letter of between your plan 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.410
 regulator and here as a condition to which they are not just from the coastal edge to 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.960
 difference of other eight localities of this quota that has more than 4 thousand 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.440
 500 kilometers that are constantly exposed to this type 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.809
 of threats 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.299
 the geographer Marcelo Lagos warns that history has not taken care of 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:12.889
 to show 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.349
 that an earthquake in Chile has many more consequences than one originated in 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.129
 action 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.079
 that only last resort is enough as lawyers to generate a tsunami of 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.089
 proportions of the most distant coasts of the Pacific
