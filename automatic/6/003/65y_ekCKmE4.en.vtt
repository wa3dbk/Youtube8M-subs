you want to make it so that you almost
to<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> middle<00:01:25.170> split<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:26.009> really

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
to a middle split but you don't really

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.469 
to a middle split but you don't really
have<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:28.220> do<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> stretch<00:01:30.119> to

have to do that you want to stretch to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.859 
have to do that you want to stretch to
one<00:01:30.509> side<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.860> other<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:33.270> go<00:01:33.540> into<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
one side I'm not other and go into the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.710 
one side I'm not other and go into the
middle<00:01:34.700> after<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
middle after you do that you want to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.109 
middle after you do that you want to
make<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> checkpoint<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.979> where<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.909> leg

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
make a checkpoint is with where your leg

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.980 
make a checkpoint is with where your leg
goes<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.740> move<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
goes like this and you move it like that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
goes like this and you move it like that
so<00:01:42.990> basically<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.979> awful<00:01:44.579> box<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so basically here that is awful box I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:53.499 
so basically here that is awful box I
point<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.869> way<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.290> see<00:01:46.590> it

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.410 

that's<00:01:54.509> how<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.719> do<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> checkmark<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.240> next<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that's how you do a checkmark and next I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.469 
that's how you do a checkmark and next I
will<00:01:57.479> show<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> UM<00:01:59.450> demonstrate<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
will show you how to UM demonstrate a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.310 
will show you how to UM demonstrate a
split<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.979> stretch<00:02:02.899> but<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
split for your stretch but I'm going to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880 
split for your stretch but I'm going to
stress<00:02:04.560> first<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.219> pull<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.610> up

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
stress first up I don't pull them up

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.320 
stress first up I don't pull them up
when<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> lean

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
up against it like this and then you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.600 
up against it like this and then you
want<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.069> go<00:02:20.190> back<00:02:20.400> resist<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.370> want<00:02:26.549> to
