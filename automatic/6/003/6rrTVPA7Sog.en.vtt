hobbies at seventy seventy percent pitch

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.540 
hobbies at seventy seventy percent pitch
and<00:00:34.750> first<00:00:35.750> first<00:00:36.590> water<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.070> going<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.309> be<00:00:37.430> at

and first first water is going to be at
seventy<00:00:37.910> percent<00:00:38.059> on<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> throttle<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.379> I'll

seventy percent on the throttle and I'll

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.069 
seventy percent on the throttle and I'll
run<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:40.370> 92<00:00:40.910> pinion<00:00:41.450> with<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.050> heli<00:00:42.290> max<00:00:43.899> 10<00:00:44.899> at

run a 92 pinion with the heli max 10 at

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.790 
run a 92 pinion with the heli max 10 at
PSC<00:00:45.499> and<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:46.940> tongue<00:00:47.179> is<00:00:47.440> really<00:00:48.440> putting<00:00:48.649> up

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
PSC and this tongue is really putting up

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.739 
PSC and this tongue is really putting up
some<00:00:48.949> power<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.820> first<00:00:50.030> speed<00:00:50.359> is<00:00:50.570> going

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
some power so the first speed is going

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.630 
some power so the first speed is going
to<00:00:50.809> be<00:00:50.899> seventy<00:00:51.260> percent<00:00:51.409> on<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.429> throttle

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
to be seventy percent on the throttle

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.180 
to be seventy percent on the throttle
and<00:00:52.940> seventy<00:00:53.329> percent<00:00:53.449> pitch<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.949> then<00:00:55.100> I'm

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
and seventy percent pitch and then I'm

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.649 
and seventy percent pitch and then I'm
gonna<00:00:55.309> go<00:00:55.429> to<00:00:55.489> one<00:00:55.699> hundred<00:00:55.760> percent<00:00:55.969> bottle

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
gonna go to one hundred percent bottle

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.279 
gonna go to one hundred percent bottle
and<00:00:58.120> they<00:00:59.120> still<00:00:59.510> have<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.749> at<00:00:59.960> seventy

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
and they still have it at seventy

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:26.760 
and they still have it at seventy
percent<00:01:00.409> pitch

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.480 

so<00:01:27.310> there's<00:01:27.520> seventy<00:01:27.880> percent<00:01:28.060> pitch<00:01:29.490> seventy

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
so there's seventy percent pitch seventy

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.450 
so there's seventy percent pitch seventy
percent<00:01:30.609> on<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.119> throttle<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:33.130> hundred

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
percent on the throttle is the hundred

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.600 
percent on the throttle is the hundred
percent<00:01:33.820> pitch<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.280> hundred<00:01:36.460> percent

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
percent pitch this is a hundred percent

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:51.500 
percent pitch this is a hundred percent
