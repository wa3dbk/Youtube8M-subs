00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.900
 hospitalization is needed what kind of anesthesia is used 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.029
 my surgical practice the francesco shelter indeed 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.589
 periodic sculptures I try to avoid it 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.050
 they are made for recovery 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.119
 practice after a few hours of walking elisa problems 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.630
 and not only does it also allow for social and family return 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.630
 which, however, facilitates recovery and create no problem 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.530
 it is clear that in front of me instead I apply sculptures of important even the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.790
 mega liposculpture I cover you will be mandatory 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.790
 weight of rare cases 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 what kind of anesthesia 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040
 it's necessary 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.140
 yet sisi is still necessary, it cannot be done without anesthesia 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.300
 in many cases the same vowel is sufficient tense perfectly 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.880
 awake 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.380
 then a local infiltration of the area 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 it depends on the size of the area and the number 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.630
 spinal anesthesia 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.780
 I don't particularly love her 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.550
 I think he can expose complications 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.570
 serious 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.440
 that they must not enter into the potential risks of an aesthetic intervention 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 when patient you cannot follow them completely awake surgery 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.140
 I request the anesthesiologist 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.460
 a 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.850
 sedation 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.930
 that is, to induce artificial sleep 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.700
 that won't take away the pain 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.150
 actually the mythical and far west local anesthesia 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.400
 but when the patient remembers the pain and in fact I have it or like it 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.630
 asleep 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.700
 in karstic paris it needs general expenses 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600
 since patient cannot be subjected to local anesthesia with 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.860
 sedation 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.030
 in the fine post surgery if staying a few more hours depends on 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.960
 number of hours that are needed for the patient to dispose of this is spread out of 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.350
 sedation 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.340
 ok the operational cases pure local anesthesia so when there are no drugs 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.560
 associates can get off the bed and go practically home 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.219
 without going through the office and then outpatient 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:16.259
 therefore the hospitalization is not necessary indeed the vast majority of cases 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.619
 by rized 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:23.489
 preferred anesthesia and local anesthesia with associated sedation 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.349
 and all this to make an intervention of mini is more effective 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.409
 low liposculpture
