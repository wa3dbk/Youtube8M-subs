 I will show how to draw two nails but 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.720
 thin brush 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 pink acrylic and black 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 I painted all the nails with black lacquer 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.470
 apply a thick layer of acrylic on your nails 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.130

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.500

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.870
 points around the flower 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.870
 it will symbolize the pollen 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.709
 and to create a festive mood 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.219

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.219
 varnish and some pink sparkles 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.700
 And so we proceed to the design of 2 nails of the span 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.340
 we will need 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.150
