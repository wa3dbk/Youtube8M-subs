but<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.910> other<00:00:36.149> thing<00:00:36.630> that's<00:00:36.840> very<00:00:36.960> odd<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
but this other thing that's very odd is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.600 
but this other thing that's very odd is
that<00:00:37.980> he<00:00:38.550> posted<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.149> cartoon<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.870> himself

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
that he posted a cartoon of himself

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
that he posted a cartoon of himself
shirtless<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.910> bed<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> shirtless

shirtless in bed with a shirtless

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
shirtless in bed with a shirtless
believer<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.579> believe<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> fan<00:00:45.480> actually

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
believer we believe that a fan actually

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
believer we believe that a fan actually
sent<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.469> him<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> he's<00:00:46.950> just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
sent this to him and he's just

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
sent this to him and he's just
retweeting<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> insinuates

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
retweeting it but it kind of insinuates

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
retweeting it but it kind of insinuates
that<00:00:49.950> he<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:50.760> sleep<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.390> fan<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that he would sleep with a fan which is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.569 
that he would sleep with a fan which is
a<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.770> weird<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.399> really

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a little weird so we don't really

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
a little weird so we don't really
understand<00:00:53.969> why<00:00:54.120> he<00:00:54.329> lost<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.960> who<00:00:55.260> who
