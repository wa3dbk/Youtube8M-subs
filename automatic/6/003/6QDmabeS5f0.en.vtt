00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the eggs and I need five eggs which I'm

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.990 
the eggs and I need five eggs which I'm
going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> separate<00:00:52.610> carefully<00:00:53.610> crack<00:00:53.820> each

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
going to separate carefully crack each

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
going to separate carefully crack each
one<00:00:54.239> when<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> whites<00:00:55.350> into<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
one when it put the whites into the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.630 
one when it put the whites into the
slightly<00:00:56.070> smaller<00:00:56.309> bowl<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.370> drop

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
slightly smaller bowl and then just drop

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.270 
slightly smaller bowl and then just drop
the<00:00:59.820> yolks<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.109> might<00:01:01.920> find<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the yolks into here you might find it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
the yolks into here you might find it
easier<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.640> crack<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.449> egg<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
easier if you just crack the egg on the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
easier if you just crack the egg on the
flat<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> board<00:01:04.949> rather<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> yolk

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
flat of the board rather than the yolk

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.820 
flat of the board rather than the yolk
does<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> bowl<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.560> less<00:01:07.799> likely

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
does a bowl and then you're less likely

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.950 
does a bowl and then you're less likely
to<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.670> bits<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.060> shell<00:01:09.299> dropping<00:01:09.659> into<00:01:09.780> your

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to get bits of shell dropping into your

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.950 
to get bits of shell dropping into your
egg<00:01:10.080> whites<00:01:11.000> okay<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.090> my<00:01:12.210> last<00:01:12.390> egg<00:01:12.659> into

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
egg whites okay it's my last egg into

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.880 
egg whites okay it's my last egg into
the<00:01:13.080> bowl<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.720> I've<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.170> golden<00:01:16.619> caster

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the bowl and I've got some golden caster

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
the bowl and I've got some golden caster
sugar<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.400> pop<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:17.820> whites<00:01:18.119> aside<00:01:18.479> for

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
sugar just pop those whites aside for

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
sugar just pop those whites aside for
the<00:01:18.720> moment<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.830> gonna<00:01:19.950> form<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the moment and this is gonna form the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.370 
the moment and this is gonna form the
base<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.700> our<00:01:20.790> cake<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.360> caster<00:01:21.750> sugar<00:01:21.780> goes<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
base of our cake so caster sugar goes in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.280 
base of our cake so caster sugar goes in
and<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> whisk<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:25.049> really

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and we need to whisk this there's really

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.710 
and we need to whisk this there's really
nice<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.040> thick<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> voluminous

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.410

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
just use a metal spoon to fold it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.460 
just use a metal spoon to fold it
together<00:01:41.830> just<00:01:42.280> try<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.760> make<00:01:42.910> sure<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.270> all

up<00:02:17.170> those<00:02:17.650> egg<00:02:17.950> whites

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.610 

now<00:02:23.700> more<00:02:23.850> once<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.180> beautifully<00:02:24.960> stiff<00:02:25.410> I'm

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
now more once a beautifully stiff I'm

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.190

going to gently fold the whites into the
base<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.090> think<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.630> good<00:02:30.750> idea<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.380> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
base and I think it's a good idea not to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.920 
base and I think it's a good idea not to
do<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.160> all<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.610> go<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.120> take<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> good<00:02:33.569> scoop

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.820

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's all beautifully mixed in there so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.050
