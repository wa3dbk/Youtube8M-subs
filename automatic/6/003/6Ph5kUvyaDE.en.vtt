00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.770
 very good everyone I'm 315 commenting and 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.139
 we are here in a new video the day of 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.250
 today in which some have leaked 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:15.459
 possible trophies for the mod map of 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.800
 of tlc 2a prising that you will have the 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.560
 xbox on Tuesday of next week and 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.710
 those of play will have to wait a bit 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.019
 later, well, these trophies to me 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.179
 seem to look like they are real but 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.490
 the strange thing is that they have leaked to 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.770
 from play 3 and as I said it is 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.690
 a month later so they could be 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.989
 false do not discard and that possibility 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.120
 but well I explain these trophies 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.180
 as if the first trophy were real 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.490
 in nobody escapes with life what is 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.850
 the interest of the map seems to be because 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.920
 it has because it's a silver trophy 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.230
 execute the escape plan good the plan 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.969
 of escape is the plane with which we 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.430
 we will transport possibly to the bridge 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.500
 from san francisco to golden gate and there 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.469
 we will have to continue surviving 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.420
 it's nothing else, that's why I'm surprised that 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.180
 hysteria is just that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 and then later we have to feed the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 beast and all the other trophies are from 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 bronze feeds the beast consists of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.600
 get the hell retriever this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.729
 it means 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.009
 to which as you saw in the trailer 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.960
 We can feed the dog s head 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.720
 of dog fire that possibly 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.520
 be flash and when we feed him 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.890
 with a certain amount of zombies 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.100
 then in the end we will get that kind of 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.130
 tomahawk boomerang that is capable of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 bring us bonuses and kill zombies then 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.940
 then we have making theirs 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.030
 complete the cycle three times here 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.490
 we have to see what a cycle is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.390
 this trophy and for the other cycles a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.390
 cycle is supposed to go from 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.819
 maybe a cycle is possibly something 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.560
 related to purgatory do not go and 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.659
 come back from purgatory but maybe a 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.960
 cycle means like I'm thinking 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.909
 go from the prison to the bridge 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.909
 san francisco and come back three times 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.160
 and so we will get this trophy now 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.050
 we'll see the other trophies passages because 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.910
 I think this then later we have the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.530
 trophy a drop of acid transforms a 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.080
 weapon through a kit not a construction 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.200
 we already know that the shotgun gets the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 box or somewhere else the shotgun 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.980
 to say magic of the map but treyarch 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.440
 he said that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.209
 this weapon would not be improved with the pack 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.620
 punch like normal weapons but that 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.959
 we would have to do it another way so 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.250
 it would be like half weapon half construction 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.379
 because its improved version is a 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.090
 construction plus what a drop of 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.879
 acid also tells us that this weapon 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.500
 because you already know the function of the 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.870
 Improved weapon that shoots with some 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.110
 acid centex and then it explodes 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.080
 Completely blocked full brutus 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.390
 his patrol 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.960
 if you put the name of brutus here 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.370
 means that there is only one 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.920
 there is a guardian or a mayor of these 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.200
 and therefore the zombie that I saw above 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.599
 as much as the one I saw under 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.870
 it's the same zombie brutus what happens is 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.670
 that we may go as 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.170
 removing the armor little by little until 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.950
 that in the end completes his patrol is 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.900
 say we killed him completely and then 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.610
 an explosion of flavor kills 10 zombie 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.829
 at the same time with the new drink you know 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.790
 that the new drink is electric cherry 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.000
 what it does is that while 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.459
 we recharge our rays 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.900
 around that they kill all the zombies 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.640
 then later we have progress 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.930
 paranormal opens a door without spending 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.190
 points this for the progress 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.690
 paranormal because it is clear that 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.890
 refers to purgatory that in the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.870
 purgatory just as we can activate 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.239
 advantage recharge advantages perks and others 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.160
 Well, we can also open 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.800
 electric doors that are spoken by 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.160
 by electricity or whatever later 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.680
 let's skip a trophy and go to 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.400
 spend trapped on time use and improve 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.519
 all the traps before round 10 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.659
 this is a novelty of the map that 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.659
 can improve the traps 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.540
 for the moment we have seen only two 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.549
 traps maybe there are more to the best 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.250
 they have their improved version that makes more 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.139
 of effect or something I do not know but you have to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.430
 use and improve all traps before 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.410
 of round 10 to get this trophy 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.889
 and now we go to the last two 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.259
 trophies golden gate bridge survives 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.410
 an entire round at the golden gate in the 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.190
 round 15 or more and pop code the wish the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.630
 that refers to a song of 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:46.380
 children do not look at youtube because 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.380
 I will not sing breaks the cycle then 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.450
 as we already know when we are going 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.640
 possibly when we go from the plane 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.900
 to the bridge of san francisco there 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.689
 we can survive or survive and then 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.449
 then possibly go back to 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.969
 go back to prison or maybe 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.319
 we can also break the cycle how it 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.879
 break that cycle to return to prison 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:17.709
 well you saw in the trailer behind the 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.029
 zombie that of brutus was seen to bring 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:20.889
 san francisco bridge and on the right it 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.539
 I saw the electric chair is then 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.129
 possibly to break the cycle then 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.749
 let's just have suicidal not here 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.009
 and so they will give us the trophy that is 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:30.099
 when we arrived at San Francisco bridge 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.920
 we can or break the suicide cycle 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:35.780
 or survive in the golden gate 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.380
 during certain amount of rounds and 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.660
 then he will possibly go back to prison 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.760
 and nothing else as I told you these 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.580
 trophy to the best they are false they will have to 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.500
 wait to see until Tuesday or what 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.470
 better a little before 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.170
 and nothing more guys tomorrow I will bring you the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.850
 chapter 3 of the story zombies and I 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.190
 it's possible because today I've been a little 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.630
 busy and tomorrow maybe also and 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.280
 it will also bring us some news 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.550
 about the canal and others that maybe you 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.200
 I greeting the interest and if you liked and 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.200
 see you next video goodbye 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.310
 yes yes
