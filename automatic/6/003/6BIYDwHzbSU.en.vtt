00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
wife to burn exactly there is i kinda

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.470 
wife to burn exactly there is i kinda
like<00:01:53.230> brown<00:01:53.440> rice<00:01:53.470> but<00:01:53.980> yeah<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:55.090> don't<00:01:55.420> know

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
like brown rice but yeah I don't know

like brown rice but yeah I don't know
I'm<00:01:55.720> American<00:01:56.230> so<00:01:56.980> I<00:01:57.550> don't<00:01:57.730> really<00:01:57.970> use<00:01:58.360> any

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
I'm American so I don't really use any

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.050 
I'm American so I don't really use any
and<00:01:59.140> there's<00:01:59.350> not<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.680> real<00:02:00.010> scientific<00:02:00.790> way<00:02:01.000> to

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and there's not a real scientific way to

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.820 
and there's not a real scientific way to
measure<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:01.720> basically<00:02:01.930> just<00:02:02.260> fill<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.770> up

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
measure this I basically just fill it up

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.400 
measure this I basically just fill it up
and<00:02:03.040> I<00:02:03.100> take<00:02:03.310> my<00:02:03.490> hand<00:02:03.790> until<00:02:04.480> it<00:02:04.810> covers<00:02:05.080> about

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
and I take my hand until it covers about

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.340 
and I take my hand until it covers about
my<00:02:05.650> knuckles<00:02:06.070> I'm<00:02:06.750> much<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.170> first

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
my knuckles I'm much like the first

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.260 
my knuckles I'm much like the first
knuckle<00:02:08.590> second<00:02:09.100> output<00:02:09.490> like<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.820> last<00:02:10.060> one

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
knuckle second output like the last one

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.540 
knuckle second output like the last one
so<00:02:10.750> I'm<00:02:10.899> gonna<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.500> go<00:02:11.740> ahead<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.040> pour<00:02:12.400> some

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
so I'm gonna just go ahead and pour some

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.610 
so I'm gonna just go ahead and pour some
more<00:02:12.700> water<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.270> here<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.290> kind<00:02:14.500> of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
more water in here and I'm kind of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.550 
more water in here and I'm kind of
eyeball<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.100> well<00:02:16.000> yeah<00:02:16.180> usually<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:17.020> lot<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
eyeball it well yeah usually a lot of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.010 
eyeball it well yeah usually a lot of
people<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:18.190> which<00:02:18.490> soak<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.090> rights<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
people of which soak the rights for a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.960 
people of which soak the rights for a
while<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.500> overlay<00:02:21.070> minutes<00:02:21.520> because<00:02:21.730> they

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
while like overlay minutes because they

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.970 
while like overlay minutes because they
think<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.270> makes<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.750> rice<00:02:22.930> taste<00:02:23.680> better<00:02:23.830> but

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
think that makes a rice taste better but

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.430 
think that makes a rice taste better but
so<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.180> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.420> eyeball<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:26.200> no

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
so I just kind of eyeball have no

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.590 
so I just kind of eyeball have no
patience<00:02:26.950> yeah<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.060> we'll<00:02:28.240> see<00:02:28.450> how<00:02:28.480> this

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
patience yeah so we'll see how this

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.380 
patience yeah so we'll see how this
turns<00:02:28.900> out<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.130> basically<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.970> take<00:02:31.180> your

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
minutes no way get to that point my free

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.630 
minutes no way get to that point my free
weight<00:03:01.330> once<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.840> reaches<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> boil<00:03:02.410> okay<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.400> we

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
weight once it reaches a boil okay so we

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.810 
weight once it reaches a boil okay so we
just<00:03:03.670> handle<00:03:04.090> out<00:03:04.180> yeah<00:03:04.450> we<00:03:04.780> just<00:03:04.900> hang<00:03:04.989> around

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
just handle out yeah we just hang around

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.640 
just handle out yeah we just hang around
right

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.229 

and<00:03:11.189> then<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.430> know<00:03:11.549> what<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.730> can<00:03:11.909> do<00:03:12.060> during

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
and then you know what you can do during

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.179 
and then you know what you can do during
this<00:03:12.420> point<00:03:12.659> in<00:03:12.959> time<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.500> make<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.829> go<00:03:13.950> by

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
this point in time is make it go by

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.940 
this point in time is make it go by
really<00:03:14.400> fast<00:03:17.480> exact<00:03:18.480> ok<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.140> now<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:19.769> been<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
really fast exact ok so now it's been a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979 
really fast exact ok so now it's been a
few<00:03:20.129> minutes<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.730> your<00:03:21.299> rice<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.720> boiling

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
few minutes and your rice is boiling

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.580 
few minutes and your rice is boiling
vigorous<00:03:22.769> well<00:03:23.329> we're<00:03:24.329> late<00:03:24.510> what's<00:03:25.319> right

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
vigorous well we're late what's right

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.649 
vigorous well we're late what's right
all<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.040> way<00:03:26.099> down<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.489> lowest<00:03:26.790> lowest<00:03:27.329> he

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
all the way down to the lowest lowest he

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.410 
all the way down to the lowest lowest he
possible<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.739> then<00:03:28.950> it'll<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.609> be<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> small

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
possible so then it'll just be a small

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.839 
possible so then it'll just be a small
simmer<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.709> put<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.040> lid<00:03:32.189> back<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.549> and

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
simmer and you put the lid back on and

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.899 
simmer and you put the lid back on and
what<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.720> turn<00:03:34.439> on<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.650> timer<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.370> 30

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
what I do is I turn on the timer for 30

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.550 
what I do is I turn on the timer for 30
minutes<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:36.599> just<00:03:36.689> look<00:03:36.930> 30<00:03:37.140> minutes<00:03:37.470> like

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
minutes so you just look 30 minutes like

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.039 
minutes so you just look 30 minutes like
