00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
her more orders and it looks like it's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:26.449 
her more orders and it looks like it's
getting<00:02:10.590> pretty<00:02:10.770> crazy<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
getting pretty crazy so now you see the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.460 
getting pretty crazy so now you see the
Germany's<00:02:27.150> obviously<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.780> getting<00:02:28.020> great

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
Germany's obviously just getting great

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.949 
Germany's obviously just getting great
and<00:02:29.000> buildings<00:02:30.000> falling<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.720> that's<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
and buildings falling and that's the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.690 
and buildings falling and that's the
first<00:02:31.200> time<00:02:31.320> we've<00:02:31.440> seen<00:02:31.680> proper<00:02:31.980> instruction

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
first time we've seen proper instruction

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.570 
first time we've seen proper instruction
to<00:02:33.510> dee<00:02:33.750> dee<00:02:36.740> snider<00:02:37.740> then<00:02:37.890> they<00:02:38.160> sit<00:02:38.310> down<00:02:38.430> on

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
to dee dee snider then they sit down on

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
to dee dee snider then they sit down on
me<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.360> that's<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.690> modern<00:02:40.019> warfare<00:02:40.170> 3

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
me so that's the modern warfare 3

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.710 
me so that's the modern warfare 3
trailers<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.160> back<00:02:41.580> everything<00:02:42.390> that's

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
trailers but back everything that's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.530 
trailers but back everything that's
being<00:02:43.080> translated<00:02:43.670> hopefully<00:02:44.670> make<00:02:45.180> sense

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
being translated hopefully make sense

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.479 
being translated hopefully make sense
and<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.590> didn't<00:02:46.739> really<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:46.920> much<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> say<00:02:47.310> but

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and I didn't really have much to say but

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.070 
and I didn't really have much to say but
it<00:02:47.820> certainly<00:02:47.970> looks<00:02:48.300> like<00:02:48.360> modern<00:02:48.720> warfare<00:02:48.870> 3

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
it certainly looks like modern warfare 3

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.080 
it certainly looks like modern warfare 3
is<00:02:49.440> gonna<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.070> interesting<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.790> looks<00:02:50.970> like

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
is gonna be interesting so it looks like

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.930 
is gonna be interesting so it looks like
Russians<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.959> taken<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.650> sort<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.370> fight<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
Russians have taken the sort of fight to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.120 
Russians have taken the sort of fight to
our<00:02:54.120> doorstep<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.860> I'm<00:02:55.920> really<00:02:56.040> looking

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
our doorstep and so I'm really looking

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580 
our doorstep and so I'm really looking
