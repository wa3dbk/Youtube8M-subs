of<00:02:01.000> hair<00:02:01.240> for<00:02:01.689> each<00:02:01.869> curl<00:02:02.229> because<00:02:02.920> it'll<00:02:03.189> just

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
of hair for each curl because it'll just

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.029 
of hair for each curl because it'll just
take<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.579> very<00:02:03.939> long<00:02:04.299> time<00:02:04.599> to<00:02:04.869> dry<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:05.469> of

gorgeous they look pretty close I think

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.280 
gorgeous they look pretty close I think
too<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.959> curling<00:03:08.680> wand<00:03:09.010> curls<00:03:09.519> um<00:03:10.299> as

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
too like curling wand curls um as

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.680 
too like curling wand curls um as
opposed<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.919> some<00:03:12.190> other<00:03:12.239> heatless<00:03:13.239> curling

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
opposed to some other heatless curling

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.330 
opposed to some other heatless curling
techniques<00:03:14.169> I<00:03:14.349> think<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.739> gives<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
techniques I think this gives you the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.650 
techniques I think this gives you the
most<00:03:15.669> the<00:03:16.419> closest<00:03:16.840> look<00:03:17.109> I<00:03:17.319> would<00:03:17.530> say<00:03:18.660> you

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
most the closest look I would say you

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.150 
most the closest look I would say you
want<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.870> make<00:03:19.959> sure<00:03:19.989> they're<00:03:20.290> all<00:03:20.319> dry<00:03:20.799> make

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
want to make sure they're all dry make

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.879 
want to make sure they're all dry make
sure<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.669> ones<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.750> back<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.319> lower

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
sure the ones in the back and lower

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.770 
sure the ones in the back and lower
section<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.880> ones<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.269> are<00:03:25.389> like<00:03:25.540> down

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
section so the ones that are like down

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.229 
section so the ones that are like down
here<00:03:25.810> those<00:03:26.620> tend<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.130> stay<00:03:27.430> wet<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.880> little<00:03:28.060> bit

here those tend to stay wet a little bit

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.839 
here those tend to stay wet a little bit
longer<00:03:28.630> through<00:03:29.440> their<00:03:29.650> towel<00:03:29.919> dry<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.400> area
