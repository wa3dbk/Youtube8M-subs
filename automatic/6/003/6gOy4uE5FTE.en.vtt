00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.139 

now<00:00:00.960> we'll<00:00:01.110> talk<00:00:01.290> about<00:00:01.439> expanded<00:00:02.340> form<00:00:02.700> if

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
now we'll talk about expanded form if

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.450 
now we'll talk about expanded form if
you<00:00:03.360> understand<00:00:03.870> place<00:00:04.200> value<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:05.279> can<00:00:05.430> take

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
you understand place value you can take

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.200 
you understand place value you can take
a<00:00:05.609> number<00:00:05.850> such<00:00:06.540> as<00:00:06.980> 297<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.189> write<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> in

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
a number such as 297 and write it in

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.839 
a number such as 297 and write it in
expanded<00:00:09.870> form<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:10.769> expand<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.550> number

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
expanded form you can expand the number

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.060 
expanded form you can expand the number
and<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.420> by<00:00:12.480> expanding<00:00:13.380> each<00:00:13.650> place

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
and you do this by expanding each place

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.720 
and you do this by expanding each place
and<00:00:14.370> here's<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.639> example<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.630> -<00:00:15.929> 9<00:00:16.560> +<00:00:16.920> 7<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> 2

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and here's an example the - 9 + 7 the 2

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.290 
and here's an example the - 9 + 7 the 2
means<00:00:18.060> 200<00:00:18.840> or<00:00:19.020> 2<00:00:19.350> times<00:00:19.770> 100<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.090> write

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
means 200 or 2 times 100 so we can write

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.679 
means 200 or 2 times 100 so we can write
2<00:00:21.740> times<00:00:22.740> 100<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.789> enclose<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.570> in

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
2 times 100 and enclose that in

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.849 
2 times 100 and enclose that in
parenthesis<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.130> 9<00:00:26.340> means<00:00:26.880> 90<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:27.779> 9<00:00:28.050> times<00:00:28.410> 10

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
parenthesis the 9 means 90 or 9 times 10

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.690 
parenthesis the 9 means 90 or 9 times 10
so<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.429> write<00:00:29.640> +<00:00:30.080> 9<00:00:31.080> times<00:00:31.500> 10<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.040> put<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
so I can write + 9 times 10 and put the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
so I can write + 9 times 10 and put the
9<00:00:32.880> times<00:00:33.180> 10<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.780> parentheses<00:00:34.380> 2<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.550> 7<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
9 times 10 in parentheses 2 and the 7 is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
9 times 10 in parentheses 2 and the 7 is
7<00:00:36.480> ones<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.440> write<00:00:37.620> +<00:00:37.980> 7<00:00:38.940> times<00:00:39.329> 1<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
7 ones so I can write + 7 times 1 so we

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.479 
7 ones so I can write + 7 times 1 so we
indicate<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.730> many<00:00:42.020> hundreds<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.489> how

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
indicate how many hundreds we have how

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
indicate how many hundreds we have how
many<00:00:44.760> tens<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.550> how<00:00:47.550> many<00:00:47.840> ones<00:00:48.840> we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
many tens we have and how many ones we

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.000 
many tens we have and how many ones we
have<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.210> 297<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.989> equal<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.530> 2

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
have and 297 you can see is equal to 2

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.610 
have and 297 you can see is equal to 2
times<00:00:53.280> 100<00:00:53.820> plus<00:00:54.690> 9<00:00:55.050> times<00:00:55.379> 10<00:00:55.680> plus<00:00:56.640> 7<00:00:56.850> times<00:00:57.239> 1

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
times 100 plus 9 times 10 plus 7 times 1

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
times 100 plus 9 times 10 plus 7 times 1
now<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.800> aren't<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.160> many<00:00:59.280> places<00:00:59.969> or

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
now there aren't really many places or

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540 
now there aren't really many places or
many<00:01:00.270> instances<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.199> need<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.370> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
many instances when you need to do this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.549 
many instances when you need to do this
when<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> take<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> number<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.260> write

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
when you need to take a number and write

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
when you need to take a number and write
it<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> expanded<00:01:05.040> form<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it in expanded form but you need to be

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
it in expanded form but you need to be
able<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:07.979> able<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> do

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
able to because if you're able to do

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
able to because if you're able to do
this<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.119> shows<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.810> understand<00:01:10.409> place

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
this it shows that you understand place

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
this it shows that you understand place
value<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:12.000> regular<00:01:12.450> way<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.780> we're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
value the regular way that we're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
value the regular way that we're
typically<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.010> typically<00:01:14.310> write<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
typically that we typically write a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
typically that we typically write a
number<00:01:14.909> 297<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.720> called<00:01:15.960> standard<00:01:16.650> form<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
number 297 is called standard form and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.999 
number 297 is called standard form and
this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.909> called<00:01:18.180> expanded<00:01:18.930> form<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.680> we'll<00:01:19.890> do

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
this is called expanded form so we'll do

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.649 
this is called expanded form so we'll do
a<00:01:20.040> couple<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.430> examples<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:20.970> write<00:01:21.450> these

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a couple of examples here write these

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
a couple of examples here write these
numbers<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.229> expanded<00:01:22.409> form<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> see

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
numbers in expanded form that you see

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
numbers in expanded form that you see
next<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> notes<00:01:25.250> 815<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.590> 4372<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> then

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
next in the notes 815 and 4372 and then

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.880 
next in the notes 815 and 4372 and then
in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.150> next<00:01:30.720> video<00:01:31.229> we'll<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
in the next video we'll look at the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560 
in the next video we'll look at the
solution<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.490> go<00:01:32.610> ahead<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.880> try<00:01:33.090> those<00:01:33.329> two

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
solution so go ahead and try those two

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.600 
solution so go ahead and try those two
on<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.780> own<00:01:34.340> 815<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.530> 4372<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.430> make

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
on your own 815 and 4372 and then make

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.590 
on your own 815 and 4372 and then make
sure<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> correct<00:01:39.329> answer<00:01:41.479> okay<00:01:42.479> in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
sure you get the correct answer okay in

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
sure you get the correct answer okay in
these<00:01:42.720> examples<00:01:43.079> were<00:01:43.409> told<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> write<00:01:44.009> these

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
these examples were told to write these

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
these examples were told to write these
numbers<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.790> expanded<00:01:45.030> form<00:01:46.220> 815<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.479> 8<00:01:48.479> times

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
numbers in expanded form 815 is 8 times

00:01:49.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
numbers in expanded form 815 is 8 times
100<00:01:50.030> plus<00:01:51.259> 1<00:01:52.259> times<00:01:52.680> 10<00:01:53.869> plus<00:01:54.869> 5<00:01:55.470> times<00:01:56.130> 1<00:01:59.210> 4372

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.130 
100 plus 1 times 10 plus 5 times 1 4372
is<00:02:01.009> 4<00:02:02.009> times<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.790> thousand<00:02:05.000> plus<00:02:06.000> 3<00:02:06.570> times<00:02:06.960> a

is 4 times a thousand plus 3 times a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
is 4 times a thousand plus 3 times a
hundred

plus 7 times 10 plus 2 times 1 and

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.020 
plus 7 times 10 plus 2 times 1 and
obviously<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:17.040> could<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.519> into<00:02:17.790> even

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
obviously we could go on into even

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.759 
obviously we could go on into even
larger<00:02:18.420> numbers<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> ten<00:02:19.260> thousands

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
larger numbers with the ten thousands
