00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
the more like pointed and separate it

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.290

and<00:02:45.240> dramatic<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.480> stuff<00:02:51.090> that's<00:02:52.090> pretty

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
and dramatic and stuff that's pretty

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.630 
and dramatic and stuff that's pretty
much<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.690> side<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.590> do<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.890> same<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.460> the
