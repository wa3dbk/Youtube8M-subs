00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.280
 great fighters in this release we 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.410
 tell you what makes the radio operator q-5 is not yet 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.749
 right now, do not look at tth non-standard 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.940
 machine guns run potapova 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.539
 technicians and again we drop by for a minute 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.759
 learning 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.560
 but first we could not get through 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930
 past this message from the official 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.730
 group of world of tanks in contact can be seen 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.890
 that sometimes even such sources can 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.450
 make mistakes or maybe group moderators 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 just forgot that last year 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.760
 there was a Japanese branch of technology where 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.160
 level one is reno father with 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.379
 negative wines at minus 22 degrees 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.359
 we wish the group moderator to be a bit 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.170
 more attentively and let's yourself 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.170
 let's talk about the facts 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 As is known, it is difficult for the whole world of tanks 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.289
 radio operator kv-5 has to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.879
 existence in the game is filled with pain and 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.679
 injustice add a pinch of salt 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.960
 the scheme also causes the wound 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.030
 booking his turrets in front of her 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.239
 120 millimeters thick and behind 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.979
 for some reason e140 what's the usual self 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 represents a machine gun world of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.390
 tanks is a small-caliber rapid rate 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.399
 gun with a small armor penetration and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 limited range of the projectile 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.149
 This description fits most. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.090
 machine guns but not for all 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.560
 For example 3 centimeter m to 103 which 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 can be installed on German lungs 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.479
 tanks 4 and 5 levels has a break through 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.479
 the main shell already in 95 millimeters 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.070
 to get a tank level 10 you 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.940
 need to accumulate 6100000 silver no more 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.979
 no less 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.460
 just so much is absolutely any 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:45.650
 top model in combat training 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.330
 changed some parameters of the technique for 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.250
 In order to quickly get rid of 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.619
 panzerkampfwagen 3 first tank 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.030
 reduced armor any armor plate has 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.430
 20 millimeters thick 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.110
 so that the t-34 85 could not break through 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.479
 royal tiger in front of him 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 made a thicker forehead case and tower but 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.860
 cut strength points and review not 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 bypassed and the second panther here 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.280
 similar symptoms developers a little 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.410
 changed booking 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.010
 review and significantly reduced strength 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.500
 cars in April 2014 wargaming 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.970
 released a video from the series we remember everything in 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.440
 which was told about the plans for 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.480
 rebuilding tank maus 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.250
 at about the same time the game client 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.989
 overdo some craftsmen and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.760
 found in the depths of the program files 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.180
 hidden from public view medal 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.980
 remember all the restoration of the tank maus 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.959
 the description of the medal contained the following 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.310
 contribution and participation in the restoration of the tank maus 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.500
 in the central armored museum 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.510
 weapons and equipment in Cuba 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.519
 although information to whom and for what 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.860
 conditions will be issued such a medal 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.410
 and whether it will be served at all 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.060
 moment is shrouded in mystery but a little 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.590
 interesting about the tanks you can 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.480
 read the article on the official website 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.480
 the game link will be in the description 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.730
 armor-piercing shells accompany us 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.570
 the very beginning of acquaintance with the game 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.670
 gradually as major 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.930
 ammunition at higher levels they 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.240
 slowly go by the wayside 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.180
 for example among medium tanks of the tenth 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.260
 only Chinese level 121 is still possible 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.000
 meet armor piercing blanks now 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.950
 smoothly go to the final part 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 issue we decided to revise the criteria 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.940
 choosing the winners of our tricky 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
 questions as interesting facts 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.540
 always come out at different times then the odds 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.280
 be in the top three correctly 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.740
 you have always answered the question 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.900
 different on this we decided it 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.030

 letters with the correct answers 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 then using the generator 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.240
 random numbers we will define three 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.940
 answer 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.459
 only the letters will be properly executed 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.100
