time down the fish pulling the tails

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.890 
time down the fish pulling the tails
they<00:02:54.760> won't<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> tendency<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> come<00:02:55.750> out

they won't have a tendency to come out

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.870 
they won't have a tendency to come out
if<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.109> just<00:02:56.290> tie<00:02:56.500> them<00:02:56.560> directly<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.280> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
if you just tie them directly in the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.970 
if you just tie them directly in the
fish<00:02:58.090> can<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.450> pull<00:02:58.660> them<00:02:58.720> right<00:02:58.989> right<00:02:59.799> out

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
fish can just pull them right right out

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.129 
fish can just pull them right right out
from<00:03:00.250> under<00:03:00.459> where<00:03:00.609> they're<00:03:00.760> tied<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.150> okay<00:03:02.079> so

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
from under where they're tied in okay so

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.240 
from under where they're tied in okay so
what<00:03:02.349> I'm<00:03:02.410> going<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.560> do<00:03:02.650> here<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.859> pull<00:03:03.160> them

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
what I'm going to do here is pull them

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.839 
what I'm going to do here is pull them
back<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:04.569> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.750> come<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.200> and

back and I'm going to come in and

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.069 
back and I'm going to come in and
usually<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:06.970> want<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.299> rubber<00:03:07.450> legs<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.900> be

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
usually you want the rubber legs to be

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.610 
usually you want the rubber legs to be
about<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.209> half<00:03:10.269> times<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.200> length<00:03:11.440> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
about one and a half times the length of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.089 
about one and a half times the length of
the<00:03:11.709> hook<00:03:11.920> shank<00:03:12.569> that's<00:03:13.569> just<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.079> length<00:03:14.889> that

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
the hook shank that's just a length that

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.460 
the hook shank that's just a length that
I've<00:03:15.400> developed<00:03:15.849> from<00:03:16.349> experience<00:03:17.349> of

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
I've developed from experience of

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.710 
I've developed from experience of
practice<00:03:17.919> if<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.639> go<00:03:18.819> much<00:03:19.030> longer<00:03:19.269> than<00:03:19.540> that

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
practice if you go much longer than that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.199 
practice if you go much longer than that
they<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.169> a<00:03:20.200> tendency<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.799> want<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.489> wrap

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
they have a tendency to want to wrap

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.629 
they have a tendency to want to wrap
around<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.780> hook<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:24.220> an<00:03:24.430> interesting

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
around the hook and it's an interesting

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.250 
around the hook and it's an interesting
thing<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.090> when<00:03:25.299> you're<00:03:25.419> efficient<00:03:25.840> popper

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
thing that when you're efficient popper

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.860 
thing that when you're efficient popper
if<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.700> rubber<00:03:27.880> leg<00:03:28.120> gets<00:03:28.450> wrapped<00:03:28.720> around

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
if the rubber leg gets wrapped around

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.930 
if the rubber leg gets wrapped around
the<00:03:29.079> hook<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:30.190> fish<00:03:30.400> will<00:03:30.549> swim<00:03:30.639> up

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
the hook like this the fish will swim up

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.229 
the hook like this the fish will swim up
look<00:03:31.269> at<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.750> swim<00:03:32.019> along<00:03:32.940> now<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.030> know

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
look at it and swim along now I know

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.940 
look at it and swim along now I know
they've<00:03:34.480> never<00:03:34.660> seen<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.989> real<00:03:35.380> bug<00:03:35.709> that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
they've never seen a real bug that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.819 
they've never seen a real bug that
really<00:03:36.310> looks<00:03:36.549> like<00:03:36.639> this<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.359> they<00:03:38.349> honestly

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
really looks like this but they honestly

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.729 
really looks like this but they honestly
will<00:03:39.280> swim<00:03:39.819> up<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.239> if<00:03:40.600> they<00:03:40.780> see<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.169> like

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
will swim up and if they see that like

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.530 
will swim up and if they see that like
that<00:03:42.009> that<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.609> know<00:03:42.729> that<00:03:43.209> didn't<00:03:43.479> look

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
that that you know that didn't look

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.070 
that that you know that didn't look
right

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
right

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.920 
right
swim<00:03:44.350> on<00:03:44.610> ok<00:03:45.610> so<00:03:45.670> what<00:03:45.940> we've<00:03:46.090> done<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.570> tied

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
swim on ok so what we've done is tied

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.330 
swim on ok so what we've done is tied
those<00:03:47.110> with<00:03:47.260> rubber<00:03:47.470> legs<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.890> pulling<00:03:48.190> them

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
those with rubber legs in pulling them

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.310 
those with rubber legs in pulling them
up<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.610> top<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.060> cinch<00:03:49.330> them<00:03:49.510> down<00:03:49.720> make

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
up on top and then cinch them down make

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.190 
up on top and then cinch them down make
some<00:03:50.700> spring<00:03:51.700> like<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:54.720> like<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.990> put<00:03:56.170> a

place now this one I'm going to use just
a<00:04:17.260> piece<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:19.920> piece<00:04:20.920> of<00:04:21.100> variegated<00:04:21.430> chenille

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
a piece of piece of variegated chenille

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.120 
a piece of piece of variegated chenille
this<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.780> chartreuse<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.500> black<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.980> don't

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
this is a chartreuse and black you don't

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.940 
this is a chartreuse and black you don't
need<00:04:30.310> very<00:04:30.520> much<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:31.060> need<00:04:31.240> maybe<00:04:31.920> less<00:04:32.920> than

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
need very much you need maybe less than

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.860 
need very much you need maybe less than
an<00:04:33.280> inch<00:04:35.550> but<00:04:36.550> what<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.730> generally<00:04:37.180> do<00:04:37.330> here<00:04:37.690> is

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
an inch but what I generally do here is

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.130 
an inch but what I generally do here is
if<00:04:38.830> it's<00:04:39.610> been<00:04:39.790> cut<00:04:40.000> off<00:04:40.030> clean<00:04:40.450> like<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.900> I

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
if it's been cut off clean like that I

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.120 
if it's been cut off clean like that I
take<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.560> in<00:04:41.860> strip<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:43.590> fuzz<00:04:44.590> right<00:04:44.920> out<00:04:45.100> of

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
take it in strip the fuzz right out of

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.200 
take it in strip the fuzz right out of
the<00:04:45.310> tip<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:46.440> piece<00:04:47.580> lay<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.640> right<00:04:48.730> on<00:04:48.880> top

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
the tip of the piece lay it right on top

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.540 
the tip of the piece lay it right on top
here<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.590> I'm<00:04:50.680> going<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.830> catch<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.070> thread

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
here and I'm going to catch the thread

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.020 
here and I'm going to catch the thread
there<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:52.390> wind<00:04:52.720> back<00:04:52.990> over<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:54.700> that
