years<00:00:26.220> back<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:28.170> was<00:00:28.320> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
years back you know I think it was a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
years back you know I think it was a
similar<00:00:28.800> allocation<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.580> end<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.849> being

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
similar allocation and end up being

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240 
similar allocation and end up being
about<00:00:30.199> 15,000<00:00:31.199> Evertonians<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
obviously Flanders just a boat tough

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030 
obviously Flanders just a boat tough
terrain<00:00:35.430> playing<00:00:35.880> hop<00:00:36.149> away<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> think<00:00:37.040> there

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
terrain playing hop away I think there

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799

will<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.370> least<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.820> double<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.180> amount<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
will but least be double that amount in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
will but least be double that amount in

something totally different and what you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
something totally different and what you
used<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.460> isn't<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> why<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
used to isn't it this is why that you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.710 
used to isn't it this is why that you
know<00:01:18.990> people<00:01:19.640> sometimes<00:01:20.640> criticized<00:01:21.509> the

know people sometimes criticized the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
know people sometimes criticized the
Europa<00:01:22.140> League<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.530> fans<00:01:23.040> were<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:24.030> wary

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
Europa League and fans were a bit wary

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390 
Europa League and fans were a bit wary
of<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.780> last<00:01:24.960> season<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.740> anything

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
of it last season but I think anything

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100 
of it last season but I think anything
that's<00:01:26.640> different<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that's different than what you you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
that's different than what you you
should<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.890> embraced<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
should be embraced and I think this is a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
should be embraced and I think this is a
fantastic<00:01:30.689> Solomon's<00:01:31.530> okay<00:01:31.770> monetary<00:01:32.400> wise

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
fantastic Solomon's okay monetary wise

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
fantastic Solomon's okay monetary wise
it's<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> shames<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> Champions<00:01:33.900> League

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it's not the shames the Champions League

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's not the shames the Champions League
but<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.490> rich<00:01:35.820> every<00:01:36.180> year

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
but we don't get these rich every year

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
but we don't get these rich every year
and<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.200> over<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.650> France<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> play<00:01:38.280> you
