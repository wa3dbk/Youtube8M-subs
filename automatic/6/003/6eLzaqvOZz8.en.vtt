00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
most part everything is really taking

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.870 
most part everything is really taking
care<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.240> itself<00:02:04.040> that's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> main<00:02:05.490> reason<00:02:05.640> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
care of itself that's the main reason I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.690 
care of itself that's the main reason I
want<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> get<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> bigger<00:02:06.540> property<00:02:06.810> because

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
want to get a bigger property because

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
want to get a bigger property because
this<00:02:08.700> may<00:02:08.910> look<00:02:09.090> huge<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> video<00:02:09.929> but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this may look huge from the video but

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.240 
this may look huge from the video but
this<00:02:10.319> really<00:02:10.770> isn't<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.160> big<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.610> all

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
this really isn't that big at all

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.180 
this really isn't that big at all
this<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.880> really<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.180> small<00:02:13.510> section<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:15.040> got

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
this is really a small section it's got

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.490 
this is really a small section it's got
planted<00:02:16.120> very<00:02:16.330> dense<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.870> know<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> urban

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
planted very dense you know in the urban

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.020 
planted very dense you know in the urban
style

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
style

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.970 
style
it's<00:02:19.030> got<00:02:19.210> between<00:02:19.750> 18<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.200> 20<00:02:20.560> fruit<00:02:20.770> trees

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
it's got between 18 and 20 fruit trees

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.850 
it's got between 18 and 20 fruit trees
in<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.930> system<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.470> really<00:02:23.740> be

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
in it but this system can really be

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.030 
in it but this system can really be
scaled<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.820> as<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.750> see<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.680> takes<00:02:26.890> very

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
scaled up as you can see it takes very

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.580 
scaled up as you can see it takes very
little<00:02:27.250> maintenance<00:02:27.550> from<00:02:27.910> me<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:29.170> if<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.440> was

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
little maintenance from me so if I was

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.190 
little maintenance from me so if I was
trying<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.459> tail<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.200> classic

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
trying to and tail and do classic

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.490 
trying to and tail and do classic
gardening<00:02:32.709> on<00:02:32.970> three<00:02:33.970> acres<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
gardening on three acres or so I just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.900 
gardening on three acres or so I just
wouldn't<00:02:35.740> have<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.950> man-hours<00:02:36.340> enough

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
wouldn't have the man-hours enough

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.210 
wouldn't have the man-hours enough
manpower<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.510> get<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.750> done

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
manpower to get it done

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.260 
manpower to get it done
but<00:02:39.220> if<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> could<00:02:39.520> set<00:02:39.700> up<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.880> system<00:02:40.060> like

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
but if you could set up a system like

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.590 
but if you could set up a system like
this<00:02:41.040> design<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.459> be<00:02:43.090> basically

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
this design it to be basically

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.080 
this design it to be basically
maintenance-free<00:02:44.670> producing<00:02:45.670> fruit<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
maintenance-free producing fruit in the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.479 
maintenance-free producing fruit in the
future<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.760> really<00:02:48.970> can't<00:02:49.209> beat<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:50.489> so

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
future and you really can't beat that so

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.770 
future and you really can't beat that so
that's<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> idea<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.270> learned<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> lot<00:02:52.630> up

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's the idea so I learned a lot up

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.090 
that's the idea so I learned a lot up
from<00:02:52.930> Joel<00:02:53.080> Salatin<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.530> got<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.739> meet<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.040> all

looks like

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.840 
looks like
trees<00:03:33.970> are<00:03:34.000> doing<00:03:34.299> real<00:03:34.450> well<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:35.640> lot<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
trees are doing real well a lot of the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.400 
trees are doing real well a lot of the
trees<00:03:37.060> are<00:03:37.180> doing<00:03:37.390> great<00:03:37.600> peaches<00:03:38.080> are<00:03:38.200> doing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
trees are doing great peaches are doing

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.840 
trees are doing great peaches are doing
great<00:03:38.590> while<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.830> stone<00:03:39.040> fruits<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.489> general

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
great while the stone fruits in general

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.330 
great while the stone fruits in general
are<00:03:39.940> doing<00:03:40.150> great<00:03:41.010> apples<00:03:42.010> are<00:03:42.130> lagging

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
are doing great apples are lagging

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.300 
are doing great apples are lagging
behind<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.820> little<00:03:42.850> bit<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.510> payers<00:03:43.720> but

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
behind a little bit and the payers but

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.960 
behind a little bit and the payers but
they'll<00:03:45.310> be<00:03:45.430> all<00:03:45.549> right

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
they'll be all right

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.550 
they'll be all right
they're<00:03:46.420> both<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.750> same<00:03:46.930> family<00:03:47.140> as<00:03:47.320> well

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
they're both in the same family as well

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.870 
they're both in the same family as well
so<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.890> can<00:03:47.980> kind<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.250> tell<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.640> stone

after I did the previous video so this

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.830 
after I did the previous video so this
is<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.500> garden<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:39.370> harvest<00:05:39.730> after<00:05:40.600> we<00:05:40.720> got

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
is the garden the harvest after we got

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.210 
is the garden the harvest after we got
back<00:05:40.900> from<00:05:41.050> Tennessee<00:05:41.350> no<00:05:41.740> one<00:05:41.860> took<00:05:41.980> care<00:05:42.040> of

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
back from Tennessee no one took care of

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.210 
back from Tennessee no one took care of
it<00:05:42.370> or<00:05:42.460> anything<00:05:42.639> no<00:05:43.180> one<00:05:43.300> water<00:05:43.480> did<00:05:43.870> anything

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
it or anything no one water did anything

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.960 
it or anything no one water did anything
because<00:05:45.220> we<00:05:45.340> really<00:05:45.580> don't<00:05:45.669> do<00:05:45.820> any

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
because we really don't do any

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.610 
because we really don't do any
maintenance<00:05:46.120> anyway<00:05:46.570> so<00:05:46.630> we<00:05:47.290> still<00:05:47.470> got<00:05:47.560> a

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
maintenance anyway so we still got a

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.990 
maintenance anyway so we still got a
decent<00:05:47.800> harvest<00:05:48.100> bunch<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.550> tomatoes<00:05:48.850> and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
decent harvest bunch of tomatoes and

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.970 
decent harvest bunch of tomatoes and
stuff<00:05:49.150> most<00:05:50.050> these<00:05:50.230> Tomatoes<00:05:50.650> I<00:05:50.740> think<00:05:50.919> I'm

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
stuff most these Tomatoes I think I'm

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.280 
stuff most these Tomatoes I think I'm
just<00:05:51.130> going<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.370> end<00:05:51.520> up<00:05:51.669> saving<00:05:52.660> seed<00:05:53.020> from

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
just going to end up saving seed from

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.420 
just going to end up saving seed from
because<00:05:53.470> we<00:05:53.530> already<00:05:53.620> have<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:53.980> many<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.280> eat

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
because we already have so many to eat

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.490 
because we already have so many to eat
so<00:05:55.240> I'll<00:05:55.330> probably<00:05:55.450> just<00:05:55.780> ferment<00:05:56.139> most<00:05:56.350> of

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
so I'll probably just ferment most of

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.490 
so I'll probably just ferment most of
these<00:05:56.590> save<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.160> seed<00:05:57.370> from<00:05:57.580> them<00:05:57.730> and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
these save the seed from them and

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.590 
these save the seed from them and
that'll<00:05:59.500> be<00:05:59.590> it<00:05:59.940> this<00:06:00.940> will<00:06:01.120> be<00:06:01.150> next<00:06:01.389> year's

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
that'll be it this will be next year's

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.719 
that'll be it this will be next year's
garden<00:06:01.780> basically<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.830> lot<00:06:03.100> of<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.280> seeds<00:06:03.490> for

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
garden basically a lot of the seeds for
