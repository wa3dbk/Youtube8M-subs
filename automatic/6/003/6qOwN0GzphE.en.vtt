00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
bag full of a bunch of anime and then

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.680 
bag full of a bunch of anime and then
from<00:03:27.519> there<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:28.540> kept<00:03:29.230> watching<00:03:30.299> all<00:03:31.299> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
from there I just kept watching all the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.770 
from there I just kept watching all the
great<00:03:32.019> titles<00:03:32.530> from<00:03:32.739> back<00:03:32.980> then<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:34.090> because

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
great titles from back then so because

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.780 
great titles from back then so because
of<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:36.190> still<00:03:37.060> hold<00:03:37.720> these<00:03:38.790> old-school

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
of this I I still hold these old-school

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.440 
of this I I still hold these old-school
titles<00:03:40.569> close<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:41.799> heart<00:03:42.099> I<00:03:42.450> definitely

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
titles close to my heart I definitely

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.379 
titles close to my heart I definitely
think<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:44.250> anime<00:03:45.250> was<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.669> different<00:03:45.970> back

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
think that anime was just different back

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.199 
think that anime was just different back
then<00:03:46.419> not<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:47.560> bad<00:03:47.829> now<00:03:48.160> by<00:03:48.549> any<00:03:48.880> means

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
then not that it's bad now by any means

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.479 
then not that it's bad now by any means

think that my family dynamic had a lot

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.970 
think that my family dynamic had a lot
to<00:04:30.200> do<00:04:30.380> with<00:04:30.760> why<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.790> was<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.900> immersed<00:04:33.440> in<00:04:33.800> the

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
to do with why I was so immersed in the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.230 
to do with why I was so immersed in the
anime<00:04:34.850> culture<00:04:35.380> because<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.770> grew<00:04:37.400> up<00:04:37.460> with<00:04:37.610> two

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
anime culture because I grew up with two

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.840 
anime culture because I grew up with two
brothers<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.810> three<00:04:38.900> sisters<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:40.190> that's

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
brothers and three sisters so that's

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.670 
brothers and three sisters so that's
five<00:04:41.360> kids<00:04:42.520> besides<00:04:43.520> me<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.350> they<00:04:45.350> were<00:04:45.410> all

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680

of<00:05:27.470> my<00:05:27.680> older<00:05:27.950> sisters<00:05:28.370> because<00:05:28.910> they<00:05:28.940> were

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
of my older sisters because they were

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.900

they<00:05:30.440> were<00:05:30.500> really<00:05:30.740> fit<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.640> they<00:05:31.850> were

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
they were really fit and they were

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.020 
they were really fit and they were
really<00:05:32.270> talented<00:05:32.450> in<00:05:33.140> sports<00:05:34.100> acrobatics<00:05:34.790> and

really talented in sports acrobatics and

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.780 
really talented in sports acrobatics and
I<00:05:35.270> just<00:05:35.840> wasn't<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.590> there's<00:05:37.340> nothing<00:05:37.610> wrong

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
I just wasn't and there's nothing wrong

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.460 
I just wasn't and there's nothing wrong
with<00:05:38.030> that<00:05:38.150> but<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.420> thought<00:05:38.660> there<00:05:39.080> kind<00:05:39.380> of

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
with that but I thought there kind of

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.880 
with that but I thought there kind of
was<00:05:39.710> at<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.160> time<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.780> so<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.170> just<00:05:42.560> kind<00:05:42.740> of

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
was at the time and so I just kind of

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.010 
was at the time and so I just kind of
really<00:05:43.220> immersed<00:05:43.580> myself<00:05:43.790> into<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.720> anime

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
really immersed myself into the anime

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.500 
really immersed myself into the anime
culture<00:05:45.290> because<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.610> was<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.850> only<00:05:46.880> thing

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
culture because that was the only thing

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.920 
culture because that was the only thing
that<00:05:47.570> I<00:05:48.260> felt<00:05:48.710> like<00:05:48.830> was<00:05:49.160> mine<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.820> was<00:05:50.270> home<00:05:50.570> all

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
that I felt like was mine I was home all

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.900 
that I felt like was mine I was home all
the<00:05:51.230> time<00:05:51.500> so<00:05:52.430> it<00:05:52.910> made<00:05:53.180> sense<00:05:53.210> for<00:05:53.630> me<00:05:53.780> to<00:05:54.910> like

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910
