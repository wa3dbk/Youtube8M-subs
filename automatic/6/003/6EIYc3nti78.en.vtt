00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I hit the ground behind the ball why do

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.939 
I hit the ground behind the ball why do
I<00:00:30.539> hit<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> ground<00:00:30.840> behind<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.410> ball<00:00:31.560> am<00:00:31.830> I

I hit the ground behind the ball am I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.569 
I hit the ground behind the ball am I
sinking<00:00:32.399> too<00:00:32.610> low<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:34.100> think<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.250> would<00:00:35.399> be

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
sinking too low I think that would be

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.910 
sinking too low I think that would be
one<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> good<00:00:36.750> probabilities<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> what's

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
one of the good probabilities of what's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.959 
one of the good probabilities of what's
going<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.950> could<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
going on and and it could be that it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
going on and and it could be that it
could<00:00:42.149> also<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.290> you're<00:00:43.469> moving

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
could also be that that you're moving

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.790 
could also be that that you're moving
off<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.920> ball<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.969> combination<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.629> both

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
off the ball or a combination of both

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
off the ball or a combination of both
because<00:00:46.800> again<00:00:47.070> when<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.420> sink<00:00:48.809> into

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
because again when we when we sink into

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
because again when we when we sink into
this<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.289> load<00:00:49.530> into<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:50.010> side<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this we load into that right side is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
this we load into that right side is
nothing<00:00:50.789> more<00:00:50.940> than<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> picture

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
nothing more than then like the picture

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.360 
nothing more than then like the picture
just<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:55.370> weight

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
just a very little very little weight

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
just a very little very little weight

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
acceptance of the right leg where he

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
acceptance of the right leg where he
sent<00:00:58.260> receives<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.640> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
key to the whole estate this whole thing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.730 
key to the whole estate this whole thing
is<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> point<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> concentrate

the flecks in it that it might flex a
little<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.659> Diego<00:01:16.380> might<00:01:16.560> go<00:01:16.770> from<00:01:16.979> here

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
little bit more Diego might go from here

to me if you're standing here looking at

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
to me if you're standing here looking at
the<00:01:55.229> knee<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:55.890> down<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.579> like

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the knee as I look down at it and like

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
the knee as I look down at it and like
it<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.750> flexing<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.590> might<00:01:59.159> be

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it because it's flexing more it might be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.370 
it because it's flexing more it might be
moving<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:02:00.000> bit<00:02:00.090> about<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> half<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.290> inch

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
resonate together and and you got proof

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.110 
resonate together and and you got proof
positive<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.500> my<00:03:38.040> head<00:03:38.220> moving<00:03:38.519> or<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.000> not

moving in and it's naturally there's a
movement<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:43.950> negligible<00:03:44.459> it's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
movement but it is so negligible it's

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.400 
movement but it is so negligible it's
highly<00:03:44.970> visible<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> heads<00:03:46.049> moving<00:03:46.230> up

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.300 
divots will be consistent in that deal
they<00:04:45.840> should<00:04:46.050> be<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.140> tearing<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.620> ball<00:04:46.800> the
