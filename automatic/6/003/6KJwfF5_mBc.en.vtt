00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.839
 it's an idea I heard during 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.920
 all weekend what is absolutely 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.049
 great is this rivalry and 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 I can now I can attribute myself 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.990
 the title of specialist since I 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.230
 studied it closely this rivalry 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 so it has existed since 1992 and by a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.580
 year since this match of December 92 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.109
 we did not hear this nonsense 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.550
 to say it's not like 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.410
 before 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 in France we have a real problem with 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 with his football now the story 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.190
 of his football we do not know anything about 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 the story of 100 football is amazing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.160
 I read for example the interviews 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 crossed of ginola of sailly in the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.780
 parisian Saturday where marcel desailly the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.760
 psg relay om of what it was 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.910
 before marcel desailly played 2 psg om 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 in his life it's great that this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.000
 marcel desailly a player how much 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 respectable on the charts 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.629
 tremendousness is fantastic and a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.579
 unheard of career but who become us 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.879
 talk about him psg om in the name of what 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.160
 I do not know he played two in his 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.080
 life that's where maybe three I forget 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.189
 maybe all the gear not but after 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.320
 it's not the fault of this one 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.299
 journalists with ali macgraw if all 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.770
 years we hear every year we hear 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.530
 it was not like before but before 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 what actually 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.890
 before a time when marseille and in water 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.229
 packaged paris packing from holland 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.340
 eric lin aulas down it's always been 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.810
 like that I know well a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.960
 book on psg om he did not do a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960
 match 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.759
 I've talked about it so much 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.960
 if I was young and I know them 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:42.060
 inside without him because he's a player 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 in 1999 in 1999 when there is the psg om where 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960
 the om must come to get the title at 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.600
 park princes paris no longer beat 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.350
 marseille at the park for seven years 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.820
 does a lot anyway 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 in today's era when what 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.689
 would say it's over it could have even 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.299
 sharks lover it's not possible we 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.740
 beats more it's more possible at the beginning 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.390
 of the 2000s Paris had to go on 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.950
 eight wins in a row that's it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.630
 believe that there was the big 8 against 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 om it was more beautiful if om om 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.090
 I'm not interested in what these people 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.190
 that you agree and that this salon is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.709
 the best the handover and there under 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 pretext that so the psg has a lot of 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.569
 means and not the om we must all buried 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 criticize madrid has not beaten to 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.500
 calderon l'oréal for 15 years is this 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.569
 that rivalry vanishes no liverpool 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.030
 was in the bag but in the bag of 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.380
 bags in the late '90s while 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.220
 manchester shine is what it did 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.760
 disappear the rivalry 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.620
 not the tottenham spurs on the one hand they 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.180
 are normal the veil to the juve and the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.090
 torino the tory are nothing gained since 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.510
 30 years old no my children me this is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.489
 apparently four minutes 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.950
 saint-amand french love history 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.209
 of his football and we do not know anything about 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.370
 the history of his football 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.510
 it does not interest us and well if it does not 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.280
 We are not interested in telling the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.450
 stories but we are not interested anymore 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.739
 football continues to tell 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.989
 bullshit it's me I'm a lover 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.489
 of this sport a passionate of its history 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.720
 and I only like 10 real things 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.630
 it's like that yes yeah bah made me 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.040
 whine blow completely I'm all to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.330
 agree at least once in the beginning 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.500
 of emission you 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.799
 completely agree with you and I 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.489
 I'll tell you better I like and I have 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.930
 liked this match 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.030
 I liked what they bossent which is 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.099
 passed before maybe found them is due 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.819
 at the limit at the limited site would have 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.830
 make a nice match 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.840
 thomas's statement would not have me 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.069
 embarrassed even though I condemn them 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.340
 if I put my little act in the 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.629
 week before you see after and where I 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.640
 agree with daniel is that me 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.140
 which bothered me in the limits I 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.730
 I did not care what the outcome me 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.470
 bored of insertech clasico before there is 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.050
 had a period when the guys was doing the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.440
 kiss on the mercy tube break the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.450
 balls 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.250
 huawei and that I do not see anymore and captures 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.959
 explain to me to explain to me what is there 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.680
 intellectuals who explained to me 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.840
 in the week that Paris players 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.030
 for them this match was nothing 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.709
 but you do not mess up good 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.720
 very well that to face the om is well 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.709
 severe for the fans and I can tell you 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.989
 to say that last night he wanted 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.579
 to learn it's om and and mellow this 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.840
 happened last night near will speak 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.040
 of the match due form we have not been 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.720
 agree with daniel and play 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.069
 erick surveys on the period of life 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.180
 the period you're referring to 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.860
 these are the kisses in the hallway 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.239
 it was also the period when the players 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.519
 pass and there was a period where he has 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.410
 spent in balo actually 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.170
 exactly because yeah they were 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.670
 all here and and beauchemin and I have 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.200
 known - the period where you do not lose 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.930
 never or even put them a few 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.690
 branlées more so put in the gnons 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.889
 marseille there has not been said 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.960
 robien 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.240
 no but there are no supporters 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.849
 Marseille at the time said huawei no 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.349
 there it has lost flavor flavor because 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.240
 that it's going more ahead and more 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.310
 was happy and has it in paris 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.419
 now because you have become 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.279
 stronger, very strong 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.279
 top is unfortunately interesting effect
