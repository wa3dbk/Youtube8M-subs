the<00:03:40.650> better<00:03:40.799> chance<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.220> any<00:03:41.370> afternoon<00:03:41.849> storm

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the better chance of any afternoon storm

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.430 
the better chance of any afternoon storm
should<00:03:42.389> be<00:03:42.510> west<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.079> state<00:03:43.290> over

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
should be west of the state over

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.140 
should be west of the state over
Mississippi<00:03:44.159> but<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.459> might<00:03:44.639> look<00:03:44.909> at<00:03:45.030> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
Mississippi but we might look at a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.319 
Mississippi but we might look at a
chance<00:03:45.479> of<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.229> late<00:03:46.379> afternoon<00:03:46.560> storm<00:03:47.329> over

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
chance of a late afternoon storm over

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.789 
chance of a late afternoon storm over
the<00:03:48.359> far<00:03:48.599> western<00:03:48.989> part<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.409> state<00:03:49.500> but

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
the far western part of the state but

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.080 
the far western part of the state but
much<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.220> state's<00:03:50.519> sunday<00:03:50.849> should<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.120> dry

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
much of the state's sunday should be dry

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.969 
much of the state's sunday should be dry
monday<00:03:54.090> big<00:03:54.690> ol<00:03:54.810> oh<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.229> goes<00:03:55.409> nowhere<00:03:55.680> it's

sitting over South Dakota and we are in

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.679 
sitting over South Dakota and we are in
its<00:03:57.629> large<00:03:57.930> warm<00:03:58.290> sector<00:03:59.030> this<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.180> suggesting

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
its large warm sector this is suggesting

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.539 
its large warm sector this is suggesting
the<00:04:00.780> better<00:04:00.930> chance<00:04:01.229> of<00:04:01.349> storms<00:04:01.560> Monday<00:04:01.949> would

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
the better chance of storms Monday would

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.830 
the better chance of storms Monday would
be<00:04:02.760> over<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.209> northern<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.750> western

low<00:04:15.090> moves<00:04:15.329> down<00:04:15.479> into<00:04:15.689> Iowa<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.259> we<00:04:16.530> are<00:04:16.709> in

that<00:04:17.039> zone<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.549> showers<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.120> storms<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:19.229> again

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
that zone of showers and storms so again

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.890 
that zone of showers and storms so again
the<00:04:19.709> GFS<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.310> almost<00:04:20.579> hinting<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> yes<00:04:21.750> there

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
the GFS is almost hinting that yes there

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.659 
the GFS is almost hinting that yes there
could<00:04:22.019> be<00:04:22.079> some<00:04:22.409> storms<00:04:22.740> here<00:04:22.950> Monday<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
could be some storms here Monday and

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.040 
could be some storms here Monday and
Monday<00:04:23.700> night<00:04:24.060> for<00:04:24.240> sure<00:04:24.419> but<00:04:24.719> the<00:04:24.870> better

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
Monday night for sure but the better

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.480 
Monday night for sure but the better
chance<00:04:25.440> could<00:04:25.740> be<00:04:25.950> no

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
chance could be no

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.309 
chance could be no
earth<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.729> west<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.060> Birmingham<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.750> really

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
earth and west of Birmingham I really

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.719 
earth and west of Birmingham I really
think<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.590> biggest<00:04:28.860> severe<00:04:29.310> weather<00:04:29.460> day

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
think the biggest severe weather day

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.240 
think the biggest severe weather day
will<00:04:29.910> be<00:04:30.060> on<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.360> day<00:04:30.539> on<00:04:30.690> Tuesday<00:04:31.220> with<00:04:32.220> a

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
will be on this day on Tuesday with a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.600 
will be on this day on Tuesday with a
good<00:04:32.669> round<00:04:32.849> of<00:04:33.090> rain<00:04:33.539> and<00:04:33.750> storms<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.610> then

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
good round of rain and storms and then

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.969 
good round of rain and storms and then
this<00:04:35.729> is<00:04:35.910> Wednesday<00:04:36.389> drier<00:04:37.349> air<00:04:37.590> begins<00:04:37.860> to

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
this is Wednesday drier air begins to

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.469 
this is Wednesday drier air begins to
push<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.400> from<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.639> north<00:04:38.849> and<00:04:39.000> west<00:04:39.210> and

push in from the north and west and

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.510 
push in from the north and west and
maybe<00:04:40.139> by<00:04:40.410> Wednesday<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.919> better<00:04:41.099> chance<00:04:41.370> of

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
maybe by Wednesday the better chance of

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.740 
maybe by Wednesday the better chance of
rain<00:04:41.729> will<00:04:41.759> be<00:04:42.000> during<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.360> morning<00:04:42.630> with<00:04:42.720> a

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
and Aniston and gaston monday could be

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.999 
and Aniston and gaston monday could be
relatively<00:05:23.340> quiet<00:05:23.990> but<00:05:24.990> this<00:05:25.139> is<00:05:25.289> tuesday<00:05:25.800> and

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
relatively quiet but this is tuesday and

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.710 
relatively quiet but this is tuesday and
again<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.340> can<00:05:26.490> see<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.759> very<00:05:26.940> unstable<00:05:27.389> air

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
again you can see the very unstable air

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.149 
again you can see the very unstable air
covering<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.199> region<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.620> instability

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
covering the region the instability

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.040 
covering the region the instability
values<00:05:29.490> are<00:05:29.639> in<00:05:29.699> excess<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.090> 2,000<00:05:30.690> joules<00:05:30.870> per

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
values are in excess of 2,000 joules per

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.260 
values are in excess of 2,000 joules per
kilogram<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:32.280> looks<00:05:32.430> like<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.610> spot<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:32.969> three

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270

thousand joules near the Mississippi
border<00:05:35.039> but<00:05:35.699> certainly<00:05:36.030> we're<00:05:36.270> going<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.449> be

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
border but certainly we're going to be

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.170 
border but certainly we're going to be
in<00:05:36.630> this<00:05:36.719> vast<00:05:37.050> sea<00:05:38.009> of<00:05:38.039> instability<00:05:38.820> monday

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
in this vast sea of instability monday

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.029 
in this vast sea of instability monday
Monday<00:05:39.599> night<00:05:39.780> Tuesday<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.469> Tuesday<00:05:40.650> night

Monday night Tuesday and Tuesday night

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.920 
Monday night Tuesday and Tuesday night
and<00:05:41.280> within<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:42.180> we<00:05:42.389> can<00:05:42.570> have<00:05:42.690> multiple

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
and within that we can have multiple

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.790 
and within that we can have multiple
rounds<00:05:43.380> of<00:05:43.650> thunderstorms<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.639> heavy<00:05:44.729> rain

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
rounds of thunderstorms and heavy rain

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.020 
rounds of thunderstorms and heavy rain
again<00:05:46.800> I'm<00:05:46.889> kind<00:05:47.099> of<00:05:47.130> picking<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.460> random<00:05:47.639> time

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
again I'm kind of picking a random time

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.610 
again I'm kind of picking a random time
here<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.419> is<00:05:48.539> just<00:05:48.659> after<00:05:48.930> midnight<00:05:49.110> Monday

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
here this is just after midnight Monday

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.249 
here this is just after midnight Monday
night<00:05:49.770> very<00:05:50.099> high<00:05:50.370> bulk<00:05:51.330> share<00:05:51.599> values<00:05:52.050> in<00:05:52.169> the

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
night very high bulk share values in the

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.680 
night very high bulk share values in the
low<00:05:52.409> level<00:05:52.590> surface<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.250> 925<00:05:53.759> millibars<00:05:54.419> over

low level surface to 925 millibars over
Alabama<00:05:55.169> Mississippi<00:05:56.069> and<00:05:56.520> parts<00:05:56.759> of

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
Alabama Mississippi and parts of

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.730 
Alabama Mississippi and parts of
Tennessee<00:05:57.030> that's<00:05:57.449> certainly<00:05:57.750> a<00:05:57.840> screaming<00:05:58.680> a

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
Tennessee that's certainly a screaming a

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.010 
Tennessee that's certainly a screaming a
tornado<00:05:59.159> threat<00:05:59.490> there<00:05:59.759> and<00:05:59.969> again<00:06:00.659> this<00:06:00.840> is

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
tornado threat there and again this is

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.950 
tornado threat there and again this is
late<00:06:01.319> late<00:06:01.849> Monday<00:06:02.849> night<00:06:02.880> early<00:06:03.539> Tuesday

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
late late Monday night early Tuesday

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.890 
late late Monday night early Tuesday
morning<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.610> this<00:06:05.610> is<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:05.880> low<00:06:06.360> level<00:06:06.509> jet

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
morning and this is the low level jet

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.200 
morning and this is the low level jet
the<00:06:07.380> numbers<00:06:07.620> are<00:06:07.770> coming<00:06:08.039> up<00:06:08.130> to<00:06:08.250> 50<00:06:08.610> knots<00:06:08.819> so

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
the numbers are coming up to 50 knots so

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.270 
the numbers are coming up to 50 knots so
again<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:09.900> problem<00:06:10.409> right<00:06:10.590> now<00:06:10.620> is<00:06:10.800> telling

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
again the problem right now is telling

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.740 
again the problem right now is telling
you<00:06:11.370> exactly<00:06:11.520> when<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.030> higher<00:06:12.210> chance<00:06:12.569> of

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
you exactly when the higher chance of

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.290 
you exactly when the higher chance of
severe<00:06:13.110> weather<00:06:13.169> will<00:06:13.530> be<00:06:13.969> as<00:06:14.969> we've<00:06:15.150> stated

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
severe weather will be as we've stated

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.999 
severe weather will be as we've stated
here<00:06:15.659> the<00:06:15.780> better<00:06:15.930> chance<00:06:16.020> i<00:06:16.380> think<00:06:16.620> Monday

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
here the better chance i think Monday

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.070 
here the better chance i think Monday
and<00:06:17.190> Monday<00:06:17.219> night<00:06:17.639> will<00:06:17.849> be<00:06:17.969> over<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.360> areas

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080

big old trough that the trough is back

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.600 
big old trough that the trough is back
all<00:06:42.419> of<00:06:42.539> a<00:06:42.599> sudden<00:06:42.899> now<00:06:42.929> the<00:06:43.219> gfs<00:06:44.219> is<00:06:44.399> getting

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
all of a sudden now the gfs is getting

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.309 
all of a sudden now the gfs is getting
back<00:06:44.759> on<00:06:44.969> the<00:06:45.059> bandwagon<00:06:45.300> with<00:06:45.749> a<00:06:45.809> big<00:06:46.019> trough

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
back on the bandwagon with a big trough

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.529 
back on the bandwagon with a big trough
and<00:06:46.529> that<00:06:46.649> would<00:06:46.739> be<00:06:46.769> colder<00:06:47.249> thickness<00:06:48.209> value

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
and that would be colder thickness value

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.999 
and that would be colder thickness value
is<00:06:48.599> coming<00:06:48.899> down<00:06:49.019> and<00:06:49.289> if<00:06:49.349> this<00:06:49.499> is<00:06:49.649> right<00:06:49.800> the

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
is coming down and if this is right the

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.649 
is coming down and if this is right the
high<00:06:50.129> Friday<00:06:50.459> would<00:06:50.669> be<00:06:50.729> in<00:06:50.939> the<00:06:51.029> 60s<00:06:51.509> and

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
high Friday would be in the 60s and

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.509 
high Friday would be in the 60s and
that's<00:06:52.619> probably<00:06:52.949> the<00:06:53.099> correct<00:06:53.339> solution

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:53.519 
that's probably the correct solution

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:55.129 
that's probably the correct solution
we've<00:06:53.909> seen<00:06:54.089> a<00:06:54.119> lot<00:06:54.330> of<00:06:54.360> that<00:06:54.599> from<00:06:54.719> the<00:06:54.809> global

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
we've seen a lot of that from the global

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.379 
we've seen a lot of that from the global
models<00:06:55.499> so<00:06:55.709> next<00:06:56.550> week<00:06:56.789> should<00:06:56.969> feature

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
models so next week should feature

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:58.999 
models so next week should feature
temperatures<00:06:57.779> well<00:06:58.139> below<00:06:58.169> average<00:06:58.439> lows

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009
