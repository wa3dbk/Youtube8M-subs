minecraft half a Minecraft day to a
breed<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.929> started<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> Sun<00:00:32.189> was

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
breed so I started when the Sun was

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.280 
breed so I started when the Sun was
vertical<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.829> sundown<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.290> shall

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
vertical so when it's sundown I shall

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.040 
vertical so when it's sundown I shall
have<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.770> foal<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:39.030> guessing<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.899> will

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
have a little foal I'm guessing it will

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.080 
have a little foal I'm guessing it will
be<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> small<00:00:40.739> baby<00:00:42.379> but<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.730> probably<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
be a small baby but I probably have the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
be a small baby but I probably have the
the<00:00:48.090> room<00:00:48.390> too<00:00:48.719> small<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the room too small because this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.660 
the room too small because this
originally<00:00:50.039> was<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.489> huge<00:00:51.180> stable<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.829> went

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
originally was my huge stable but I went

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.619 
originally was my huge stable but I went
on<00:00:53.850> playing<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:55.460> with<00:00:56.460> zombies<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
on playing on with zombies and all that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
on playing on with zombies and all that
and<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.789> believe<00:01:00.469> it<00:01:01.469> ate<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.370> once

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and I believe it ate it and this once

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.670 
and I believe it ate it and this once
was<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.890> zombie<00:01:04.890> creeper<00:01:05.549> room<00:01:06.409> there<00:01:07.409> used<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
was a zombie creeper room there used to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.810 
was a zombie creeper room there used to
be<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.830> dungeon<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.700> transformed<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
be a dungeon and I transformed it into a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
be a dungeon and I transformed it into a
stable<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.420> maybe<00:01:13.290> these<00:01:13.560> zombies<00:01:14.070> spawned

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
stable so maybe these zombies spawned

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.840 
stable so maybe these zombies spawned
and<00:01:14.880> killed<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> horses<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.580> too

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and killed all the horses I I'm not too

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
and killed all the horses I I'm not too
sure<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:20.930> they're<00:01:21.930> getting<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.439> all

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sure on that but they're getting at all

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.230 
sure on that but they're getting at all
