00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.540
 hi friends today we will talk about a topic 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.180
 very interesting that affects us all 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.000
 what are the contractures and points 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.460
 trigger and how they are produced 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.529
 many people suffer from muscle pain and 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.840
 physical problems but very few people 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.060
 knows that these problems are 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.270
 related to trigger points or 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.430
 trier points understand and apply a 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.379
 treatment to trigger points help 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.140
 much to diminish these problems already 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.780
 improve the health and wellbeing 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.910
 trigger points or trier points are a 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.340
 small muscle contraction maintained 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.590
 that can feel under the skin like a 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.080
 nodule are very painful on palpation 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.149
 the trigger points can exist in 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.550
 all the muscles of the body can 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.630
 present several Arabs or in both 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.370
 sides of the body 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.620
 simultaneously the trigger point 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.300
 keeps the muscle tense and weak 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.300
 limiting their ability to move 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.250
 in most cases they cause 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.570
 pain away from its origin to this is it 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.570
 called pain referred 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.659
 each muscle has a pain map and 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.390
 this makes the diagnosis of 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.460
 trigger points be complicated to 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.220
 below we can see the maps of 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.869
 pain of some trigger points if 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.750
 we analyze the trigger point in 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.090
 depth we can see that always 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.149
 finds located in a muscular band 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.460
 tense we can feel the tense band 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.930
 like a cord if we make a 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.750
 palpation around the trigger point 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.210
 deepening further we observe that each 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 muscle is made up of millions of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.620
 muscle fibers 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.830
 the small lines perpendicular to the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.570
 fibers represent the shark or groupers 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.390
 these act like a bomb 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.450
 contracting simultaneously for 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.550
 produce muscle contraction 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.560
 Arcs mere can be over stimulated 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.720
 losing the ability to relax 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.330
 creating a small thick nodule to the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.700
 palpation this small nodule shortens the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.150
 muscle fiber causing an envelope 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.390
 stretch and tension at its ends 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.370
 forming a tense muscular band 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.950
 a trigger point is composed of 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.700
 several muscle fibers in dysfunction or 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.700
 shortening 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.030
 the mere arcs shortened or in dysfunction 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.890
 cause blood to not flow well 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.260
 result of lack of blood and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.300
 oxygen is the accumulation of products 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.760
 of muscle wastes that remain 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.850
 stagnant in this area needing the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.590
 nerve receptors and the trigger point 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.630
 sending pain signals to our 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.550
 brain our brain acts on 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.860
 consequence tensing the muscle 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.320
 thus preventing us from using it which 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.560
 it increases more the tension and the products 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.810
 of waste within the muscle the points 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.000
 Trigger are not released without treatment 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.820
 adequate the most effective way of 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.830
 treat a trigger point is applying a 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.110
 deep and direct pressure on the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.080
 this is what we can do 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.450
 we will perform pressures or massages 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.730
 deep on the trigger point to 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.280
 achieve your release in this example 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.260
 we put a ball between the back and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.680
 the wall to make passes on the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.680
 muscle 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.370
 by moving the ball slowly and deeply 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.190
 from side to side on the trigger point 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.770
 the blood and the lymphatic fluid are 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.200
 evacuated from the point improving their 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.050
 research providing oxygen and 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.430
 nutrients to the area and decreasing the 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.950
 irritation 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.340
 the ideal is to apply this technique four 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.290
 times a day for two or three minutes 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.689
 the release of a trigger point can 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.579
 take several days or weeks until 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.380
 recover normalcy and relief 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.690
 muscular 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.400
 the trigger points that have endured in 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.800
 our body for longer 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.800
 will require more time to be 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.150
 eliminated but with perseverance 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.150
 we can achieve the same results 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.350
 if you want to learn more about the points 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.870
 trigger and the techniques needed to 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.120
 release them you can click on the
