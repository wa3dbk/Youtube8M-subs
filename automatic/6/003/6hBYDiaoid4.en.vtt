little<00:00:26.980> engineers<00:00:27.460> at<00:00:27.610> boss<00:00:27.790> have<00:00:28.060> done<00:00:28.240> it

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
little engineers at boss have done it

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.960 
little engineers at boss have done it
again<00:00:28.450> they<00:00:28.840> have<00:00:28.930> taken<00:00:29.289> their<00:00:29.440> iconic<00:00:30.010> box

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
again they have taken their iconic box

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.450 
again they have taken their iconic box
you<00:00:31.090> know<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.450> classic<00:00:31.690> boss<00:00:32.619> top<00:00:33.010> box<00:00:33.280> that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
you know the classic boss top box that

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.490 
you know the classic boss top box that
we<00:00:33.520> all<00:00:33.640> know<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.270> love<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:34.510> well<00:00:35.020> and<00:00:35.350> they've

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
we all know and love so well and they've

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.310 
we all know and love so well and they've
put<00:00:36.129> something<00:00:36.550> else<00:00:36.699> in<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:36.970> that's<00:00:37.180> awesome

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
put something else in it that's awesome

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.930 
put something else in it that's awesome
the<00:00:38.590> noise<00:00:38.739> suppressor<00:00:39.160> really<00:00:39.430> works<00:00:39.640> let's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
the noise suppressor really works let's

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.780 
the noise suppressor really works let's
just<00:00:40.150> let's<00:00:40.750> just<00:00:40.840> call<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.140> what<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.409> is<00:00:41.790> it's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
just let's just call it what it is it's

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.000 
just let's just call it what it is it's
a<00:00:43.059> you<00:00:43.480> know<00:00:43.510> an<00:00:43.690> expander/gate<00:00:44.199> sort<00:00:44.920> of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
a you know an expander/gate sort of

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.119 
a you know an expander/gate sort of
thing<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.750> well<00:00:46.750> just<00:00:47.050> here<00:00:47.559> we<00:00:47.650> go<00:00:47.800> let<00:00:48.040> me

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
thing and well just here we go let me

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.380 
thing and well just here we go let me
shut<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.430> off<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.850> can<00:00:48.970> hear<00:00:49.150> what<00:00:49.269> the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
shut it off so you can hear what the

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.410 
shut it off so you can hear what the
what<00:00:49.690> you're<00:00:49.809> not<00:00:50.050> hearing<00:00:50.350> right<00:00:50.589> now<00:00:54.420> right

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
what you're not hearing right now right

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.329 
what you're not hearing right now right
and<00:00:55.659> you<00:00:56.110> also<00:00:56.229> heard<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.739> intro<00:00:57.100> that's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
and you also heard in the intro that's

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.710 
and you also heard in the intro that's
the<00:00:57.430> same<00:00:57.610> sound<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.879> was<00:00:57.970> using<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.390> intro<00:00:58.600> by

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
the same sound I was using the intro by

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.180 
the same sound I was using the intro by
the<00:00:58.780> way<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:58.989> also<00:00:59.140> heard<00:00:59.500> like<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.860> delay

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
the way you also heard like the delay

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.969 
the way you also heard like the delay
trails<00:01:00.699> at<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.330> end<00:01:01.479> of<00:01:01.659> it<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:01.960> how<00:01:02.500> clean<00:01:02.830> it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
trails at the end of it and how clean it

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.649 
trails at the end of it and how clean it
was<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:03.489> how<00:01:03.670> there<00:01:03.820> was<00:01:03.940> no<00:01:04.059> noise<00:01:04.269> well

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
was and how there was no noise well

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.590 
was and how there was no noise well
that's<00:01:04.989> because<00:01:05.350> there's<00:01:06.070> basically<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:07.000> loop

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
that's because there's basically a loop

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.539 
that's because there's basically a loop
built<00:01:07.990> into<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:09.340> take<00:01:09.520> your

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
built into this and you take your

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.070 
built into this and you take your
noisiest<00:01:10.120> pedals<00:01:10.510> which<00:01:10.690> are<00:01:10.810> going<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:10.990> be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
noisiest pedals which are going to be

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840 
noisiest pedals which are going to be
your<00:01:11.200> gain<00:01:11.409> pedals<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:11.979> your<00:01:12.100> compression<00:01:12.640> and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
your gain pedals in your compression and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.279 
your gain pedals in your compression and
that<00:01:13.060> sort<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.329> stuff<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.750> put<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.079> in

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
that sort of stuff and you put that in

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.170 
that sort of stuff and you put that in
the<00:01:14.380> loop<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.860> then<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.369> take<00:01:15.579> all<00:01:15.759> your<00:01:15.789> time

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
the loop and then you take all your time

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.450 
the loop and then you take all your time
base<00:01:16.450> effects<00:01:17.200> like<00:01:17.439> modulation<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.250> delay

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
base effects like modulation and delay

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.310 
base effects like modulation and delay
and<00:01:18.610> reverb<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.149> put<00:01:19.390> them<00:01:19.539> after<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
and reverb and put them after so the the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.929 
and reverb and put them after so the the
way<00:01:23.439> that<00:01:23.469> works<00:01:23.799> is<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.039> your<00:01:24.430> time-based

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
way that works is that your time-based

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.660 
way that works is that your time-based
effects<00:01:25.240> are<00:01:25.359> not<00:01:25.509> affected<00:01:26.140> by<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.460> gate<00:01:27.460> at

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
effects are not affected by the gate at

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.969 
effects are not affected by the gate at
all<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.750> quickly<00:01:29.109> going<00:01:29.380> over<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.680> features

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
all so quickly going over the features

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.760 
all so quickly going over the features
of<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.189> pedal<00:01:30.460> here<00:01:30.640> there's<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.630> light<00:01:32.289> that's

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
of the pedal here there's a light that's

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.469 
of the pedal here there's a light that's
called<00:01:33.159> reduction<00:01:33.460> lets<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.000> know<00:01:34.149> when<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
called reduction lets you know when the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.510 
called reduction lets you know when the
noise<00:01:35.109> reduction<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.649> actually<00:01:35.979> working<00:01:36.219> and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
noise reduction is actually working and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.179 
noise reduction is actually working and
here<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.359> threshold<00:01:37.630> control<00:01:38.289> will<00:01:38.859> turn<00:01:39.039> it

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
here is a threshold control will turn it

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.389 
here is a threshold control will turn it
all<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.340> way<00:01:39.429> down<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.189> can<00:01:42.280> see

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
all the way down right so you can see

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.190 
all the way down right so you can see
that's<00:01:42.520> allowing<00:01:42.939> some<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.240> noise<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
that's allowing some of the noise to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.639 
that's allowing some of the noise to
come<00:01:44.409> through<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:44.920> as<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.280> turn<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.579> back<00:01:45.700> up

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
come through and as we turn it back up

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.910 
come through and as we turn it back up
it<00:01:47.649> squashes<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.369> noise<00:01:48.549> pretty<00:01:49.420> cool<00:01:49.570> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it squashes the noise pretty cool and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.849 
it squashes the noise pretty cool and
the<00:01:50.920> decay<00:01:51.250> time<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.880> how<00:01:52.329> quickly<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:53.140> fades

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
the decay time is how quickly it fades

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.340 
the decay time is how quickly it fades
at<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.429> end<00:01:54.640> or<00:01:54.850> how<00:01:54.969> you<00:01:55.539> know<00:01:55.659> slowly<00:01:56.049> it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
at the end or how you know slowly it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.200 
at the end or how you know slowly it
fades<00:01:56.619> at<00:01:56.859> the<00:01:56.979> end<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.280> note<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.640> allows

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
fades at the end of the note and allows

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.679 
fades at the end of the note and allows
the<00:01:58.509> kind<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.899> noise<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.619> be<00:01:59.829> squelched<00:02:00.689> you've

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
the kind of noise to be squelched you've

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.899 
the kind of noise to be squelched you've
also<00:02:01.840> got<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> mode<00:02:02.499> switch<00:02:02.890> here<00:02:03.219> you've<00:02:03.640> got

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
also got a mode switch here you've got

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.880 
also got a mode switch here you've got
reduction<00:02:04.390> mode<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.780> mute<00:02:04.990> mode<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:05.799> you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
reduction mode and mute mode so if you
