00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
memory so you got a lot of space on here

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.049 
memory so you got a lot of space on here
also<00:00:27.070> there's<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.160> little<00:00:28.520> slot<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:28.939> can

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:30.469 
plug in extra memory card in here if we

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:33.100 
plug in extra memory card in here if we
need<00:00:30.680> it<00:00:30.969> it's<00:00:31.969> really<00:00:32.390> small<00:00:32.780> but<00:00:32.840> it's

also if you know the MX 10 is an
upgraded<00:00:38.270> version<00:00:38.390> of<00:00:38.719> that<00:00:38.870> some<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.410> the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
upgraded version of that some of the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.920 
upgraded version of that some of the
things<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.280> they<00:00:40.370> improved<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:40.970> it<00:00:41.000> we<00:00:41.810> have

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
things that they improved on it we have

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.170 
things that they improved on it we have
a<00:00:41.960> better<00:00:42.829> video<00:00:43.040> quality<00:00:43.310> so<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:43.880> colors

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
a better video quality so the colors

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.160 
a better video quality so the colors
come<00:00:44.329> out<00:00:44.450> more<00:00:44.570> crisp<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.050> beautiful

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
come out more crisp and beautiful

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.770 
come out more crisp and beautiful
they've<00:00:46.100> got<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.310> better<00:00:46.489> LCD<00:00:47.060> screen<00:00:47.390> on<00:00:47.510> here

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
they've got a better LCD screen on here

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.410 
they've got a better LCD screen on here
but<00:00:48.320> face<00:00:48.710> recognition<00:00:48.980> which<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:49.730> pretty

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
but face recognition which is a pretty

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.450 
but face recognition which is a pretty
cool<00:00:50.660> feature<00:00:50.870> can<00:00:51.200> recognize<00:00:51.650> if<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.860> faces

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
cool feature can recognize if it faces

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.490 
cool feature can recognize if it faces
so<00:00:53.239> if<00:00:53.570> you're<00:00:53.750> recording<00:00:53.989> you<00:00:54.200> have<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.410> worry

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
so if you're recording you have to worry

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.930 
so if you're recording you have to worry
about<00:00:54.620> people<00:00:55.010> being<00:00:55.250> out<00:00:55.340> of<00:00:55.399> focus<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:55.910> I

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
about people being out of focus so I

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.240 
about people being out of focus so I
actually<00:00:56.060> recognize<00:00:56.660> how<00:00:57.410> person's<00:00:57.860> face<00:00:58.070> is

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
actually recognize how person's face is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.760 
actually recognize how person's face is
built<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.730> then<00:00:59.110> focusing<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:00.470> up<00:01:00.680> to

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
built and then focusing on that up to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.179 
built and then focusing on that up to
eat<00:01:00.920> people<00:01:01.329> there's<00:01:02.329> also<00:01:02.540> um<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.290> better<00:01:03.829> anti

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
eat people there's also um a better anti

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.370 
eat people there's also um a better anti
shake<00:01:04.630> feature<00:01:05.630> out<00:01:05.840> here<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
shake feature out here so the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.749 
shake feature out here so the
stabilization<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.189> really<00:01:07.369> good<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.640> don't

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
stabilization is really good you don't

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.030 
stabilization is really good you don't
have<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.939> worry<00:01:08.060> about<00:01:08.090> camera<00:01:08.570> shake<00:01:08.810> and

battery life some comparable cameras

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.060 
battery life some comparable cameras
don't<00:01:23.180> come<00:01:23.360> even<00:01:23.479> close<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.960> this<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:24.740> three

the<00:03:45.430> 2.7<00:03:46.430> inch<00:03:46.700> LCD<00:03:46.880> screen<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.989> let's<00:03:51.169> take<00:03:51.260> a

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
the 2.7 inch LCD screen now let's take a

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.800 
the 2.7 inch LCD screen now let's take a
closer<00:03:51.560> look<00:03:51.739> at<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.220> 34<00:03:53.030> times<00:03:53.269> optical<00:03:53.780> zoom

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
closer look at the 34 times optical zoom

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.080 
closer look at the 34 times optical zoom
we've<00:03:54.079> got<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.440> here<00:03:54.650> see<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:55.579> across<00:03:55.790> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
we've got on here see you across the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.780 
we've got on here see you across the
table<00:03:56.299> about<00:03:56.840> 6<00:03:57.799> 7<00:03:57.980> feet<00:03:58.220> away<00:03:58.310> from<00:03:58.430> me<00:03:58.669> I've

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
table about 6 7 feet away from me I've

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.530 
table about 6 7 feet away from me I've
got<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.780> box<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.260> MX<00:04:00.530> 20<00:04:01.299> same<00:04:02.299> all<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
got the box of the MX 20 same all the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.319 
got the box of the MX 20 same all the
way<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:02.840> on<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:05.019> did<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.139> see<00:04:06.349> really<00:04:07.329> clear

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
way in on it did you see really clear

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.030 
way in on it did you see really clear
imaging<00:04:08.750> on<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.049> other<00:04:09.260> side<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.709> thumb

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
imaging on the other side of that thumb

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.589 
imaging on the other side of that thumb
switch<00:04:10.400> because<00:04:10.609> it's<00:04:10.849> optical<00:04:11.299> zoom<00:04:11.329> you

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
switch because it's optical zoom you

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.890 
switch because it's optical zoom you
don't<00:04:11.750> lose<00:04:11.900> any<00:04:12.109> resolution<00:04:12.620> with<00:04:12.769> it<00:04:13.900> now

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
don't lose any resolution with it now

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.479 
don't lose any resolution with it now
since<00:04:15.380> we've<00:04:15.530> got<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.709> zoomed<00:04:15.950> in<00:04:16.099> this<00:04:16.280> far

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
since we've got it zoomed in this far

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.890 
since we've got it zoomed in this far
I'll<00:04:16.789> show<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.030> another<00:04:17.150> cool<00:04:17.510> feature<00:04:17.660> they

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
I'll show you another cool feature they

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900 
I'll show you another cool feature they
put<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.320> actually<00:04:19.130> notices<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> little<00:04:19.820> bit

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
put on you actually notices a little bit

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.510 
put on you actually notices a little bit
of<00:04:20.000> shake<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.599> natural<00:04:21.250> camera<00:04:22.250> shake

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
of shake this is natural camera shake

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.260 
of shake this is natural camera shake
they<00:04:23.270> put<00:04:23.539> a<00:04:24.280> anti<00:04:25.280> shake<00:04:25.490> stabilized<00:04:26.060> around

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
they put a anti shake stabilized around

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.379 
they put a anti shake stabilized around
here<00:04:26.539> though

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
here though

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.580 
here though
turn<00:04:27.629> that<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:27.900> take<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.259> look<00:04:28.439> at<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
turn that on take a look at the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.059 
turn that on take a look at the
difference<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:30.960> does<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.139> smooth<00:04:31.620> out<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
difference so it does it smooth out the

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.029 
difference so it does it smooth out the
shakiness<00:04:32.490> it's<00:04:32.819> not<00:04:33.229> quite<00:04:34.229> so<00:04:34.259> jerky<00:04:34.800> as<00:04:34.889> it

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
shakiness it's not quite so jerky as it

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.300 
shakiness it's not quite so jerky as it
was<00:04:35.129> before<00:04:36.080> pop<00:04:37.080> back<00:04:37.409> so<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.800> can<00:04:37.949> compare

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
was before pop back so you can compare

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:46.080 
was before pop back so you can compare
again

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.990 

and<00:04:46.720> one<00:04:47.139> more<00:04:47.320> time<00:04:47.530> without<00:04:47.850> with<00:04:48.850> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
and one more time without with the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.260 
and one more time without with the
anti-shake<00:04:49.510> on<00:04:51.930> s<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.080> just<00:04:53.110> smooths<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.620> out

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
anti-shake on s it just smooths it out

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.900 
anti-shake on s it just smooths it out
makes<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.389> nicer<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:55.870> when<00:04:55.990> you're<00:04:56.110> trying<00:04:56.290> to

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
makes it nicer so when you're trying to

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.980 
makes it nicer so when you're trying to
show<00:04:57.910> some<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.120> your<00:04:58.270> home<00:04:58.360> videos<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.840> don't

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
show some of your home videos I don't

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.920 
show some of your home videos I don't
get<00:04:59.080> motion<00:04:59.290> sickness<00:04:59.710> because<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.130> got<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
get motion sickness because you got the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.600 
get motion sickness because you got the
anti<00:05:01.930> shake<00:05:02.169> setup<00:05:02.590> on<00:05:02.770> there<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.280> just

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
anti shake setup on there so it just

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.050 
anti shake setup on there so it just
makes<00:05:03.790> it<00:05:03.910> a<00:05:04.000> lot<00:05:04.090> easier<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.480> watch<00:05:05.790> no<00:05:06.790> take<00:05:07.000> a

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
makes it a lot easier to watch no take a

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.430 
makes it a lot easier to watch no take a
look<00:05:07.180> at<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.300> really<00:05:07.450> cool<00:05:07.750> new<00:05:07.960> feature<00:05:07.990> on

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
look at a really cool new feature on

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.340 
look at a really cool new feature on
here<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.800> interval<00:05:09.220> recording<00:05:09.870> says<00:05:10.870> turn<00:05:11.230> it

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
here the interval recording says turn it

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.920 
here the interval recording says turn it
on<00:05:13.440> yeah<00:05:14.440> as<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:14.860> can<00:05:14.889> see<00:05:14.980> here<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:16.389> seconds

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
on yeah as you can see here the seconds

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.420 
on yeah as you can see here the seconds
so<00:05:17.560> up<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.790> 1<00:05:19.000> 3<00:05:19.540> 5<00:05:20.190> 10<00:05:21.190> 15<00:05:22.000> 30<00:05:22.860> what<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.160> is

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
so up to 1 3 5 10 15 30 what that is is

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.490 
so up to 1 3 5 10 15 30 what that is is
um<00:05:24.639> with<00:05:24.970> interval<00:05:25.330> recording<00:05:25.840> normal<00:05:26.229> video

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
um with interval recording normal video

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.280 
um with interval recording normal video
is<00:05:26.830> shot<00:05:27.100> at<00:05:27.310> 30<00:05:27.700> frames<00:05:27.880> per<00:05:28.120> second<00:05:28.570> what

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
is shot at 30 frames per second what

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.930 
is shot at 30 frames per second what
this<00:05:29.410> will<00:05:29.560> do<00:05:29.710> is<00:05:29.740> they<00:05:30.190> only<00:05:30.340> shoot<00:05:30.580> one

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
this will do is they only shoot one

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.210 
this will do is they only shoot one
frame<00:05:31.210> per<00:05:31.240> second<00:05:31.810> or<00:05:31.990> 3<00:05:32.350> frames<00:05:32.650> per<00:05:32.830> second

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
frame per second or 3 frames per second

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.280 
frame per second or 3 frames per second
whatever<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.610> have<00:05:33.729> it<00:05:33.880> set<00:05:34.060> at<00:05:34.090> so<00:05:35.020> you'll<00:05:35.169> go

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
whatever you have it set at so you'll go

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.110 
whatever you have it set at so you'll go
ahead<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.740> will<00:05:35.830> be<00:05:35.979> like<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.220> time-lapse

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
ahead and it will be like a time-lapse

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.100
