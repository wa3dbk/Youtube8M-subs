in-between the NC G 1 &amp; 2 microphones

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.480 
in-between the NC G 1 &amp; 2 microphones
and<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.549> ntg-3<00:01:11.650> now<00:01:12.650> let's<00:01:12.950> have<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.280> quick

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
and the ntg-3 now let's have a quick

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.520 
and the ntg-3 now let's have a quick
look<00:01:13.700> at<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.909> NT<00:01:14.120> g4<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.900> then<00:01:15.020> I'll<00:01:15.110> go<00:01:15.229> on<00:01:15.380> to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
look at the NT g4 and then I'll go on to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.170 
look at the NT g4 and then I'll go on to
the<00:01:15.620> real<00:01:15.799> special<00:01:16.190> features<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.729> 4<00:01:16.940> plus

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
the real special features of the 4 plus

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.930 
the real special features of the 4 plus
so<00:01:17.780> firstly<00:01:18.770> you'll<00:01:19.070> see<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.370> same<00:01:19.549> digital

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
so firstly you'll see the same digital

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.870 
so firstly you'll see the same digital
switching<00:01:20.360> options<00:01:20.690> on<00:01:20.870> both<00:01:21.080> microphones

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
switching options on both microphones

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.810 
switching options on both microphones
starting<00:01:22.880> with<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.180> -10<00:01:23.869> DB<00:01:24.049> pad<00:01:24.530> now<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.070> -10

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
starting with a -10 DB pad now the -10

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.700 
starting with a -10 DB pad now the -10
DB<00:01:25.940> pad<00:01:26.299> basically<00:01:26.840> just<00:01:26.990> attenuates<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
DB pad basically just attenuates the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.859 
DB pad basically just attenuates the
input<00:01:28.220> from<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.549> microphone<00:01:29.090> by<00:01:29.299> 10<00:01:29.570> decibels

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
input from the microphone by 10 decibels

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.800 
input from the microphone by 10 decibels
allowing<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.100> record<00:01:31.600> everything<00:01:32.600> from

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
allowing you to record everything from

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.109 
allowing you to record everything from
very<00:01:33.049> quiet<00:01:33.350> sounds<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.860> very<00:01:34.040> loud<00:01:34.250> sounds<00:01:34.670> we

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
very quiet sounds to very loud sounds we

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.660 
very quiet sounds to very loud sounds we
have<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.509> 75<00:01:36.140> Hertz<00:01:36.380> high-pass<00:01:36.890> filter<00:01:37.340> which

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
have a 75 Hertz high-pass filter which

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.760 
have a 75 Hertz high-pass filter which
basically<00:01:38.210> cuts<00:01:38.509> out<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.750> lower<00:01:39.079> frequency

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
basically cuts out the lower frequency

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.200 
basically cuts out the lower frequency
Rumble<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.460> might<00:01:40.640> find<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.119> typical

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
Rumble that you might find on a typical

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
of our shotgun microphones and that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.200 
of our shotgun microphones and that's
the<00:01:54.200> high<00:01:54.350> frequency<00:01:54.859> boost<00:01:55.130> now<00:01:55.759> any<00:01:55.969> time

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the high frequency boost now any time

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.910 
the high frequency boost now any time
you<00:01:56.329> place<00:01:56.539> any<00:01:56.810> kind<00:01:57.109> of<00:01:57.140> mass<00:01:57.380> in<00:01:57.590> front<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.859> a

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
you place any kind of mass in front of a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.319 
you place any kind of mass in front of a
microphone<00:01:58.280> capsule<00:01:58.729> like<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.909> windshield

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
microphone capsule like a windshield

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.419 
microphone capsule like a windshield
especially<00:02:00.109> the<00:02:00.259> furry<00:02:00.499> kind<00:02:00.859> of<00:02:01.039> windshields

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
especially the furry kind of windshields

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.249 
especially the furry kind of windshields
that<00:02:01.460> you'll<00:02:01.640> use<00:02:01.850> outdoors<00:02:02.299> you'll<00:02:02.990> lose<00:02:03.229> a

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
that you'll use outdoors you'll lose a

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.959 
that you'll use outdoors you'll lose a
tiny<00:02:03.710> little<00:02:03.950> bit<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.130> your<00:02:04.310> high<00:02:04.399> frequency

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
tiny little bit of your high frequency

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.940 
tiny little bit of your high frequency
so<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.420> high<00:02:05.570> frequency<00:02:06.049> boost<00:02:06.320> on<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
so the high frequency boost on the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.919 
so the high frequency boost on the
microphone<00:02:07.399> itself<00:02:07.820> enables<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.450> get<00:02:08.720> all

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
microphone itself enables you to get all

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.749 
microphone itself enables you to get all
of<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.110> high<00:02:09.530> frequency<00:02:09.979> energy<00:02:10.100> back<00:02:10.520> and
