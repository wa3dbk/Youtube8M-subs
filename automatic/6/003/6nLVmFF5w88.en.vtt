 that day I bought the skyrim game myself 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.130
 I was excited because they told me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.109
 It was very good Everything was fine 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.120
 I was a little disconcerted because I did not 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 I had heard about that but I was that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 Rags told me that will make you greedy me 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 I gave it little importance and as it was 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.289
 wait for me I became the harlem 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.210

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 unimaginable 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.180
 then I started looking for the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 objects the first one was a very skull 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.149
 and I defended myself with everything and I beat it with 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.610
 a little bit of difficulty I came back with what 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.979
 they had told me about the objects and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.039
 they said that for sure it was someone who 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.140
 I was looking for the pieces then I left 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.299

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.080

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.000
 very strange and the same woman came out and I 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.670
