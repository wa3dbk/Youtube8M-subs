okay hopefully

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.490 
okay hopefully
got<00:00:10.509> a<00:00:10.539> question<00:00:10.719> about

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
got a question about

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.770 
got a question about
as<00:00:11.680> a<00:00:11.770> pipe<00:00:11.980> I<00:00:12.490> actually<00:00:12.850> sent<00:00:13.210> my<00:00:13.330> pipe<00:00:13.540> to<00:00:13.750> the

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
as a pipe I actually sent my pipe to the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.019 
as a pipe I actually sent my pipe to the
Pacific<00:00:14.710> Crest<00:00:14.860> pipe<00:00:15.070> repair<00:00:15.340> they<00:00:15.850> did<00:00:15.969> a

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
Pacific Crest pipe repair they did a

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.550 
Pacific Crest pipe repair they did a
great<00:00:16.119> job<00:00:16.240> they<00:00:16.540> cleaned<00:00:16.750> it<00:00:16.840> up<00:00:16.930> got<00:00:17.470> this

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
great job they cleaned it up got this

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.810 
great job they cleaned it up got this
big<00:00:17.770> old<00:00:17.890> dent<00:00:18.040> out<00:00:18.190> of<00:00:18.340> that<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:18.520> had<00:00:18.670> right

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
big old dent out of that I had right

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.920 
big old dent out of that I had right
here<00:00:19.060> and<00:00:22.349> burned<00:00:23.349> it<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.570> got<00:00:25.570> most<00:00:25.810> the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
here and burned it and got most the

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.200 
here and burned it and got most the
carbon<00:00:26.290> out<00:00:26.349> they<00:00:26.529> say<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:27.009> most<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:27.910> carbon

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
carbon out they say that most the carbon

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.240 
carbon out they say that most the carbon
builds<00:00:28.480> up<00:00:28.570> in<00:00:28.690> the<00:00:28.750> first<00:00:28.990> Bend<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:30.010> the<00:00:30.039> pipe

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
builds up in the first Bend of the pipe

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.810 
builds up in the first Bend of the pipe
here<00:00:30.580> so<00:00:30.880> that<00:00:31.660> was<00:00:31.779> all<00:00:31.900> burned<00:00:32.110> out<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.640> I

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
here so that was all burned out and I

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.490 
here so that was all burned out and I
was<00:00:33.940> just<00:00:34.059> curious<00:00:34.300> if<00:00:34.690> I<00:00:34.900> want<00:00:35.080> to<00:00:35.140> try<00:00:35.440> to

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
was just curious if I want to try to

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.860 
was just curious if I want to try to
clean<00:00:35.739> my<00:00:35.860> pipe<00:00:36.070> out<00:00:36.280> later<00:00:36.550> now<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.449> could<00:00:37.720> do

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
clean my pipe out later now I could do

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.320 
clean my pipe out later now I could do
it<00:00:38.050> I<00:00:38.710> don't<00:00:39.160> have<00:00:39.340> an<00:00:39.430> oxy<00:00:39.699> acetylene<00:00:39.760> torch

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
it I don't have an oxy acetylene torch

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.880 
it I don't have an oxy acetylene torch
so<00:00:40.420> I'll<00:00:40.510> probably<00:00:40.600> invest<00:00:40.960> in<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.140> matte<00:00:41.320> torch

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
so I'll probably invest in a matte torch

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.560 
so I'll probably invest in a matte torch
that'll<00:00:42.340> get<00:00:42.460> hot<00:00:42.640> enough<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:43.030> propane<00:00:43.390> just

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
that'll get hot enough the propane just

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.819 
that'll get hot enough the propane just
doesn't<00:00:43.809> seem<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:43.960> get<00:00:44.110> hot<00:00:44.260> I<00:00:44.380> can't<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:44.739> it

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
doesn't seem to get hot I can't get it

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.799 
doesn't seem to get hot I can't get it
hot<00:00:44.920> enough<00:00:45.040> with<00:00:45.219> propane<00:00:45.550> torch<00:00:45.790> so<00:00:46.480> came<00:00:46.690> up

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
hot enough with propane torch so came up

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.500 
hot enough with propane torch so came up
with<00:00:46.899> this<00:00:47.020> little<00:00:47.260> cable<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.700> about<00:00:48.880> 26

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
with this little cable this is about 26

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.440 
with this little cable this is about 26
inches<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.079> quarter<00:00:51.010> inch<00:00:51.160> maybe<00:00:51.820> 3/8<00:00:52.270> might

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
inches of a quarter inch maybe 3/8 might

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.420 
inches of a quarter inch maybe 3/8 might
even<00:00:52.600> work<00:00:52.750> better<00:00:52.960> just<00:00:53.500> frayed<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.890> end<00:00:54.100> put

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
even work better just frayed the end put

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.340 
even work better just frayed the end put
a<00:00:54.460> little<00:00:54.730> aluminum<00:00:55.890> end<00:00:57.149> swedge<00:00:58.350> whatever

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
a little aluminum end swedge whatever

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.200 
a little aluminum end swedge whatever
they're<00:00:59.500> called<00:00:59.710> clamp<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:00.700> on<00:01:00.910> right<00:01:01.059> there

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
they're called clamp that on right there

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.700 
they're called clamp that on right there
just<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.480> keep<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:01.719> from<00:01:01.870> fraying<00:01:02.200> way<00:01:02.410> way<00:01:02.559> way

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
just to keep it from fraying way way way

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.249 
just to keep it from fraying way way way
down<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:04.539> want<00:01:04.660> to<00:01:04.720> open<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:04.960> up<00:01:05.110> too

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
down and don't want to open this up too

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.270 
down and don't want to open this up too
much<00:01:05.379> because<00:01:05.530> then<00:01:05.680> I<00:01:05.710> can't<00:01:05.920> get<00:01:06.039> it<00:01:06.130> on<00:01:06.160> the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
much because then I can't get it on the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.999 
much because then I can't get it on the
pipe<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.729> then<00:01:07.539> just<00:01:08.110> chuck<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.410> in<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.649> drill

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
pipe and then just chuck it in the drill

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.620 
pipe and then just chuck it in the drill
I<00:01:09.220> just<00:01:09.580> cut<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.880> end<00:01:10.000> off<00:01:10.090> with<00:01:10.149> a<00:01:10.330> cut-off

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
I just cut the end off with a cut-off

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.490 
I just cut the end off with a cut-off
wheel<00:01:10.690> because<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:13.020> bolt<00:01:14.020> cutters<00:01:14.320> just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
wheel because the bolt cutters just

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.260 
wheel because the bolt cutters just
didn't<00:01:14.710> get<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.830> clean<00:01:15.039> cut<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.090> cutoff

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
didn't get a clean cut so the cutoff

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.000 
didn't get a clean cut so the cutoff
wheel<00:01:16.450> just<00:01:16.689> made<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:16.840> nice<00:01:17.020> clean<00:01:17.229> cut<00:01:17.409> I<00:01:17.680> could

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
wheel just made a nice clean cut I could

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.500 
wheel just made a nice clean cut I could
check<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.430> this<00:01:18.820> old<00:01:19.000> piece<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.360> junk

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
check it in the this old piece of junk

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.210 
check it in the this old piece of junk
drill<00:01:19.720> make<00:01:20.170> sure<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.409> run<00:01:20.530> this<00:01:20.650> backwards<00:01:21.130> if

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
drill make sure to run this backwards if

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.190 
drill make sure to run this backwards if
you<00:01:21.310> run<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.580> forwards<00:01:22.000> if<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:22.840> run<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.170> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
you run it forwards if you run it to the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.390 
you run it forwards if you run it to the
right<00:01:23.470> it'll<00:01:24.220> unwind<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.670> cable<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.890> I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
right it'll unwind the cable which I

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.810 
right it'll unwind the cable which I
found<00:01:28.030> out<00:01:28.180> by<00:01:29.049> experience<00:01:29.500> so<00:01:29.950> run<00:01:30.400> backwards

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
found out by experience so run backwards

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.670 
found out by experience so run backwards
and<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:32.320> we<00:01:32.439> did<00:01:32.590> was<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.900> I<00:01:35.110> got<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> little

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
and all we did was and I got a little

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.609 
and all we did was and I got a little
good<00:01:36.340> little<00:01:36.460> pile<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.759> carbon<00:01:37.210> out<00:01:37.619> even

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
good little pile of carbon out even

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.859 
good little pile of carbon out even
after<00:01:38.710> Pacific<00:01:39.189> Crest<00:01:39.340> cleaned<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.570> they

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
after Pacific Crest cleaned it so they

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.210 
after Pacific Crest cleaned it so they
may<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.110> just<00:01:41.229> burned<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.560> one<00:01:41.770> end<00:01:41.979> and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
may have just burned that one end and

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.819 
may have just burned that one end and
then<00:01:43.229> worried<00:01:44.229> too<00:01:44.350> much<00:01:44.380> about<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.799> rest

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
then worried too much about the rest

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.649 
then worried too much about the rest
that<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.549> didn't<00:01:45.850> really<00:01:46.030> get<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:46.210> much<00:01:46.450> out

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
that I didn't really get that much out

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.410 
that I didn't really get that much out
but<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.530> anyway<00:01:47.650> just<00:01:48.130> use<00:01:48.579> a<00:01:48.610> gloved<00:01:48.939> hand<00:01:49.000> of

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
but so anyway just use a gloved hand of

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.840 
but so anyway just use a gloved hand of
a<00:01:49.869> somewhere<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.350> safety<00:01:50.829> goggles<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:53.850> just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
a somewhere in safety goggles and I just

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.980 
a somewhere in safety goggles and I just
cut<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.090> long<00:01:55.210> enough<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.659> where<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.840> would<00:01:55.960> fit

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
cut it long enough to where it would fit

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.580 
cut it long enough to where it would fit
down<00:01:56.320> about<00:01:57.220> maybe<00:01:57.640> 2/3<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.329> pipe<00:01:58.590> because

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
down about maybe 2/3 of the pipe because

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.050 
down about maybe 2/3 of the pipe because
it<00:01:59.890> has<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.100> make<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.430> Bend<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.790> come<00:02:00.939> back

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
it has to make this Bend and come back

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.020 
it has to make this Bend and come back
and<00:02:01.299> cover<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:01.630> area<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.549> wanted<00:02:03.939> to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and cover this area that and I wanted to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.490 
and cover this area that and I wanted to
kind<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.299> overlap<00:02:04.630> no<00:02:04.750> matter<00:02:04.899> which<00:02:05.079> end<00:02:05.380> I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
kind of overlap no matter which end I

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:35.619 
kind of overlap no matter which end I
came<00:02:05.740> in

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.820 

so<00:02:36.629> what<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> knocks<00:02:37.140> around<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.620> there

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
so what kind of knocks around in there

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.820 
so what kind of knocks around in there
makes<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.640> lot<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.790> noise<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.680> whether<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:40.799> not

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
makes a lot of noise and whether or not

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.800 
makes a lot of noise and whether or not
it<00:02:41.010> gets<00:02:41.099> everything<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.640> don't<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.879> probably

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it gets everything I don't know probably

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
it gets everything I don't know probably
get<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.019> big<00:02:43.170> stuff<00:02:45.319> then<00:02:46.319> getting<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.709> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
get the big stuff then getting it and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.530 
get the big stuff then getting it and
this<00:02:46.920> ends<00:02:47.159> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.370> bit<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.610> pain<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.090> if

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
this ends a little bit of a pain but if

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.850 
this ends a little bit of a pain but if
you<00:02:48.690> kind<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.989> feed<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.409> gloved<00:02:49.620> hand

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
you kind of feed it with the gloved hand

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.430 
you kind of feed it with the gloved hand
and<00:02:50.190> kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.150> put<00:02:51.330> some<00:02:51.480> foil<00:02:51.750> tape<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and kind of put some foil tape in it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:20.839 
and kind of put some foil tape in it
it'll<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.830> around

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.589 

now<00:03:21.849> I've<00:03:21.970> already<00:03:22.180> done<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.510> couple

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
now I've already done this a couple

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.690 
now I've already done this a couple
times<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.770> just<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.099> an<00:03:24.190> example<00:03:24.610> so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
times so this is just for an example so

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.750 
times so this is just for an example so
I<00:03:24.760> don't<00:03:24.880> expect<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.209> get<00:03:25.330> much<00:03:25.510> out
