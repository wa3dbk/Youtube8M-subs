normally<00:04:06.890> we'd<00:04:07.220> be<00:04:07.250> ok<00:04:07.670> find<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.150> direct<00:04:08.450> route

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
normally we'd be ok find a direct route

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.800 
normally we'd be ok find a direct route
but<00:04:09.019> given<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.769> Colorado<00:04:10.310> terrain<00:04:10.850> this<00:04:11.480> time

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
but given the Colorado terrain this time

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.039 
but given the Colorado terrain this time
it's<00:04:12.170> better<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.709> stick<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.220> Airways

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
it's better to stick to the Airways

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.569 
it's better to stick to the Airways
let's<00:04:15.049> assume<00:04:15.350> we've<00:04:15.680> got<00:04:15.859> our<00:04:15.980> clearance<00:04:16.400> and

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
let's assume we've got our clearance and
