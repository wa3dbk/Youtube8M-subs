00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.579 

what's<00:00:02.159> up<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.179> doing<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.589> benchmark

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
what's up going to be doing a benchmark

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.340 
what's up going to be doing a benchmark
here<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.549> might<00:00:05.940> tie<00:00:06.210> all<00:00:06.450> these<00:00:06.660> benchmarks

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
here I might tie all these benchmarks

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.860 
here I might tie all these benchmarks
into<00:00:07.770> one<00:00:08.250> video<00:00:08.429> but<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> first<00:00:09.420> one

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
into one video but this is the first one

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.110 
into one video but this is the first one
that<00:00:09.990> I'm<00:00:10.110> running<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.559> I've<00:00:11.429> got<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.820> pretty

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
that I'm running and I've got it pretty

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.299 
that I'm running and I've got it pretty
close<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.049> top<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.799> I'm<00:00:13.920> pretty

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
close to the top here and I'm pretty

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950 
close to the top here and I'm pretty
close<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.820> screen<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
close to the screen this is the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.490 
close to the screen this is the
obviously<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> macbook<00:00:17.130> pro<00:00:17.160> retina<00:00:17.369> display

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
obviously the macbook pro retina display

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.490 
obviously the macbook pro retina display

650m nvidia graphics as well anyways

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
650m nvidia graphics as well anyways
I've<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.250> statistics<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I've got these statistics up here this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.380 
I've got these statistics up here this
is<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.090> CPU<00:00:39.750> temperature<00:00:40.730> right<00:00:41.730> next<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
is the CPU temperature right next to and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
is the CPU temperature right next to and
that's<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.170> believe<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.980> should<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.399> kind

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's the I believe that should be kind

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.040 
that's the I believe that should be kind
of<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> die<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.730> GPU<00:00:48.450> diode

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of on the die this is the GPU diode

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
of on the die this is the GPU diode
temperature<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> nvidia<00:00:52.730> 650<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
temperature that's the nvidia 650 and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.549 
temperature that's the nvidia 650 and
this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.379> hard<00:00:55.770> drive<00:00:56.039> activity<00:00:56.730> LEDs

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
this is just hard drive activity LEDs

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.819 
this is just hard drive activity LEDs
here<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.800> lights<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.469> network

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
here or lights and this is my network

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.820 
here or lights and this is my network
that's<00:01:02.070> irrelevant<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.000> test<00:01:03.830> here's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that's irrelevant for this test here's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.640 
that's irrelevant for this test here's
the<00:01:04.920> memory<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.880> using<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.470> all

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the memory that I'm using I do have all

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.539 
the memory that I'm using I do have all
the<00:01:07.830> applications<00:01:08.250> closed<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:11.400> know

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the applications closed out but you know

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.870 
the applications closed out but you know
this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.150> what's<00:01:12.600> being<00:01:13.229> used<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this is what's being used there and I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.310 
this is what's being used there and I
allocated<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.200> cpu<00:01:16.740> usage<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.880> graph

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
allocated all the cpu usage to one graph

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.820 
allocated all the cpu usage to one graph
right<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.320> yeah<00:01:22.320> let's<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.680> ahead

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
right over here so yeah let's go ahead

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
right over here so yeah let's go ahead
and<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.880> we've<00:01:24.000> gone<00:01:24.240> through<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> run

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and now that we've gone through that run

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.010 
and now that we've gone through that run
the<00:01:25.290> tests<00:01:26.130> finally<00:01:27.439> yes<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.100> also<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:30.020> plugged

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the tests finally yes and also i plugged

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
the tests finally yes and also i plugged
in<00:01:31.380> i<00:01:31.740> don't<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> makes<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in i don't know if that makes a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.109 
in i don't know if that makes a
difference<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:34.079> speed<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.189> plugged<00:01:35.909> in

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
difference on speed but I'm plugged in

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
difference on speed but I'm plugged in
so<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.259> running<00:01:37.560> directly<00:01:38.009> off<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so it's not running directly off the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:02:26.190 
so it's not running directly off the
battery

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.070 

okay<00:02:26.980> looks<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.730> got<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> score<00:02:29.400> 1103<00:02:30.400> I

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
okay looks like we got a score 1103 I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.550 
okay looks like we got a score 1103 I
actually<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.410> no<00:02:32.709> idea<00:02:32.980> at<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:35.260> that's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
actually have no idea at all if that's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.430 
actually have no idea at all if that's
good<00:02:35.800> or<00:02:35.830> bad<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:37.150> be<00:02:37.300> honest<00:02:38.280> looks<00:02:39.280> like

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
good or bad to be honest looks like

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.229 
good or bad to be honest looks like
drive<00:02:41.440> right<00:02:42.069> speed<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.269> little<00:02:43.690> low<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
drive right speed is a little low you

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.570 
drive right speed is a little low you
know<00:02:46.360> from<00:02:46.630> what<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> was<00:02:46.989> expecting<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:48.099> do<00:02:48.340> have

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
know from what I was expecting I do have

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.150 
know from what I was expecting I do have
a<00:02:48.989> benchmark<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:50.650> we<00:02:50.769> can<00:02:50.950> run<00:02:51.510> um

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
a benchmark for that that we can run um

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.280 
a benchmark for that that we can run um
vets<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.580> mean<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.090> seems<00:02:55.299> really<00:02:55.599> good<00:02:55.840> you

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
vets I mean that seems really good you

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.979 
vets I mean that seems really good you
know<00:02:57.269> 426<00:02:59.280> relatively<00:03:00.280> speaking<00:03:00.519> that's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
know 426 relatively speaking that's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.970 
know 426 relatively speaking that's
pretty<00:03:01.989> good<00:03:02.220> yeah<00:03:03.599> I<00:03:04.599> have<00:03:05.290> no<00:03:05.440> idea<00:03:05.620> actually

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
pretty good yeah I have no idea actually

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.740 
pretty good yeah I have no idea actually
on<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.370> other<00:03:06.640> specifications<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.720> I

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
on the other specifications here I

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.650 
on the other specifications here I
haven't<00:03:08.200> ran<00:03:08.349> this<00:03:08.560> on<00:03:08.819> any<00:03:09.819> other<00:03:10.000> systems<00:03:10.480> to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
haven't ran this on any other systems to

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.509 
haven't ran this on any other systems to
really<00:03:10.840> compare<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.319> but<00:03:11.650> there's<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.160> score

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
really compare it but there's the score

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.880 
really compare it but there's the score
I'm<00:03:12.790> gonna<00:03:13.540> be<00:03:13.750> going<00:03:14.079> ahead<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.500> running

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
I'm gonna be going ahead and running

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.289 
I'm gonna be going ahead and running
some<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.190> these<00:03:15.310> benchmarks<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.150> my

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
some of these benchmarks on my

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.600 
some of these benchmarks on my
hackintosh<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.519> maybe<00:03:18.519> comparing<00:03:19.120> those<00:03:19.410> so
