00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 in the month of May 2010 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.520
 we had the opportunity to fly montilla 4 cent from his side 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.890
 sandoval this alliance 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 thus he has related the comfort that is manaos 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.930
 the one thousand 100 nautical miles 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.870
 that there is approximately 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.790
 when one uses the fierce day hope cut 4 4 2 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.700
 poper corfo 4 4 6 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.640
 to the airport of maiquetía 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.999
 where do we take the photo of the faa 3 15 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.999
 that takes us to manaos the game took about 2 for up to 40 minutes 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.850
 and called a cruising altitude of 40 thousand feet that is 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.250
 level 4 0 0 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 on this flight we left the pri curazao 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.200
 whose initials are 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 franco does not return vest work 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.890
 entering the boat position by signing that tian 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.970
 lands víctor add 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.570
 and then in the vacant position 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.380
 at the end amazon ica 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.870
 Bravo lands step by step 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.500
 with respect to the radio frequency once we take off from aruba in 120 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.810
 points 9 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.410
 we went to the control of curacao 127 1 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.960
 entering the firm that aunt changed us to the frequency of 128 5 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.710
 then on the airport of maiquetía 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.720
 we were for a while in 125 points 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.690
 and the rest of the Venezuelan territory we emit the frequency of 127 95 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.880
 that cover 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 practically all the south of venezuela 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.200
 to the west break of flight that is up to 40 thousand ten 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.590
 we did not have real reach problems 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.440
 on the contrary we copied multiple repeaters that cover the area 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.439
 controlled in 127 25 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.230
 what causes echoes quito not that they need to pay attention to understand 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.309
 correctly the intentions of the cc 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.189
 we also had the same experience 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.099
 when in the vacant position we contact the tc of brazil 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.859
 in what is known as 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.709
 Amazonian control 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.519
 in 125 points 4 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.859
 gift because of the vast space cover 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.459
 there are many repeater 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 Giano the first one also caused echoes 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.629
 when you get to both 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.689
 the limit is to say we are about 150 miles 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:46.739
 of boavista 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.469
 our alternate 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.789
 which is equipped with control tower 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.219
 gas 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.719
 and the df and has the necessary authorities 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.149
 in case we had to enter the country 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.219
 for this airport 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.409
 later when we were at min 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.079
 the distance boavista close bravo bravo víctor 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.079
 it was only 115 nautical miles 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.529
 When flying in Brazil, always have that hand of the artist Pérez 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.409
 then when the art remains a change of frequencies 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.319
 in the u a principal 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.259
 and another alternative 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.589
 this is 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:26.980
 a large number of number to memorize or to select 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.059
 in the neighborhoods once 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:33.559
 in the Amazons we were in constant radar contact 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.729
 which is always a relief 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.799
 like the flight six in the afternoon you called a lot of big clouds 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.289
 vertical development 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.959
 that are formed in the Amazon rainforest 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.159
 but without much trouble we could and communicate them 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.059
 about 100 miles from the portmany november earth 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.399
 of manaos 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.839
 and commanded by the aircraft fmc team 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.159
 we require authorization 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.319
 to start our descent 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.429
 which they gave us up to 15 thousand feet where they changed us with the control of 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.169
 approach manaos 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.309
 and practically did not come down to interpret and ls lafita 10 of 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.349
 airport 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.169
 very soon we begin to have in sight 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.489
 the large amount of water that leads to hatred that form the Amazon river 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.489
 spectacle of incredible majesty 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.690
 soon we are dazzled by the amount of high buildings street manaos 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:32.629
 especially considering that it is located in the heart of the jungle 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.309
 amazonian and the second home very remote when they are coming at hand 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.469
 you alternate 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.599
 pretty 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.759
 you find some 335 nautical miles 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.900
 a little far to be quiet 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.580
 so if there had been a problem with the adjudication is that it has 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.669
 Maradona 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.419
 maybe we would have landed on a military base will restrict it to 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.840
 located just 8 miles 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.919
 it's called font appealed 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.129
 close bravo evil do not sell 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.020
 and that does not have immigration and customs service 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.409
 and prior permission is required to land air 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.669
 but maybe we could have preferred that they know that we are prisoners of málaga 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.589
 that they had not been looking in the Amazon jungle 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.139
 for now we land in hand 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.939
 and what the images of the Amazon jungle will do 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.139
 a part of the planet where the human presence is minimal 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.860
 in Manaus Suframa much ease icon 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.520
 it's a pity that we could not take the picture 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.349
 to better illustrate that video 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.349
 but the housework closes allows it 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.919
 Thank you for joining us in this agreement and do not forget to visit 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.779
 balls three dot com 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:44.559
 We will wait for you
