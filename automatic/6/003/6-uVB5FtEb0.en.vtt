purposes I use one of these nice square
shot<00:00:45.420> glasses<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> rather<00:00:47.100> large<00:00:47.520> and

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.009 
feels very smooth and warm on the way
down<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.049> that's<00:03:52.169> always<00:03:52.409> nice<00:03:54.019> aftertaste

down so that's always nice aftertaste
aftertaste<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:56.069> me<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.669> very<00:03:57.269> important<00:03:57.900> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
aftertaste to me is very important and

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.499 
aftertaste to me is very important and
that's<00:03:58.169> because<00:03:58.379> if<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.879> doesn't<00:04:00.060> taste<00:04:00.329> good

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509 
that's because if it doesn't taste good
