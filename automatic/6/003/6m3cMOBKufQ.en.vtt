00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.780
 let's see how to remove the notice of 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.250
 bootloader unlocked in the motorola 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.639
 head after unlocking the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.940
 bootloader that is this notice that we are going to 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.940
 see below 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.130
 this 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.130
 let's remove it 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.630
 to start with the process we have to 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.400
 have three files the drivers of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.780
 motorola 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.379
 this file called moto hello 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.910
 Android SDK left him three 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.309
 in the description of the video I'm going to 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.790
 leave here and decompress the engine on 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.480
 Wolf and him 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.860
 the sdk then let's unzip 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.740
 copy and we're going to paste in 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.020
 in the sdk of 'does not have dry 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.810
 on your platform 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.880
 and we will pass the phone to put it 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.460
 in usb debug mode and continue with 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.890
 the process to put our engine in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.360
 debug mode usb we have to go 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.970
 to configuration 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.150
 we have to go to the programmer 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.910
 and here we have to have palomeada this 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.060
 debugging option by usb if by 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.579
 some reason they do not have 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 this programmer tab has to go 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.300
 to about the phone and the number of 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.850
 compilation have to give it 7 times 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.500
 until I tell you that they are already 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.620
 programmers and have 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.900
 this tab programmer here the option 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.780
 and already can and activate debugging by 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.640
 usb once installed the raid true 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.890
 motorola 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.790
 put the phone in debug mode 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.780
 usb and add these two files to the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.430
 Android sdk folder 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.140
 let's let's put the phone in 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.140
 fast boot mode and connect it to the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.030
 computer through a usb cable 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.100
 the following way 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.370
