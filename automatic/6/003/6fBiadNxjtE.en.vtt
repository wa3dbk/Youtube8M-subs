the date you pull the crown out to
position<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.879> can

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
position one like that and you can

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.860 
position one like that and you can
rotate<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.600> crown<00:00:45.899> clockwise<00:00:47.570> can<00:00:48.570> advance

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it stops the watch and I can synchronize

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
it stops the watch and I can synchronize
to<00:01:03.030> watch<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.489> reliable<00:01:07.460> time<00:01:08.460> source<00:01:09.320> I'm

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to watch with a reliable time source I'm

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
to watch with a reliable time source I'm
going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> Tom<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> clock<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.570> push

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
going to Tom and clock or so if you push

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
going to Tom and clock or so if you push

me I've had this watch almost six years

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.530 
me I've had this watch almost six years
now<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.010> half<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.700> more<00:03:35.910> than<00:03:36.000> half<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.330> time

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
now and half the more than half the time

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.880 
now and half the more than half the time
it's<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> dark<00:03:37.080> but<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.350> remember<00:03:37.800> to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
it's in the dark but I do remember to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.470 
it's in the dark but I do remember to
take<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> out<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.430> expose<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.000> some<00:03:39.300> light

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
take it out and expose it to some light

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.930 
take it out and expose it to some light
so<00:03:40.080> while<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.470> may<00:03:40.590> not<00:03:40.620> be<00:03:40.770> fully<00:03:41.160> charged<00:03:41.610> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
so while it may not be fully charged it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.790 
so while it may not be fully charged it
still<00:03:42.540> has<00:03:42.630> enough<00:03:42.840> power<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.140> keep<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
still has enough power to keep going and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.940 
still has enough power to keep going and
to<00:03:44.340> keep<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.760> said<00:03:44.940> good<00:03:45.090> time<00:03:45.709> now<00:03:46.709> by

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
to keep like I said good time now by

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.350 
to keep like I said good time now by
good<00:03:47.160> time<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.490> means<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.820> keeps<00:03:48.060> time

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
good time it means that keeps time

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.000 
good time it means that keeps time
within<00:03:48.570> three<00:03:48.990> seconds<00:03:49.410> every<00:03:49.620> couple<00:03:49.950> of

within three seconds every couple of

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.750 
within three seconds every couple of
months<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.940> that's<00:03:51.090> pretty<00:03:51.270> accurate

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
months so I think that's pretty accurate

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.160
