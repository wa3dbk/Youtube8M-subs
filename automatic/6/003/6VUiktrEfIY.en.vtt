 Oberbayern amateurs spoken it would not be good if you communally 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.630

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.870

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.970

 with recipes with the text solms 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 We hope that we will be able to continue like this among the guests 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.930
 Perfect 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 To cook on this standard LF are extremely difficult 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.080
 At these, where you have the curve here, we have great stunts 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.120
 Kitchen locked 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.940
 otherwise one can only get 42 house guests on average 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.730
 and great power this evening 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.159
 490 people and yet 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.159

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.639

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.859
 I think it should look 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.889
 they also do not have to be satisfied with the guests then i think so 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.079
 everything went perfectly 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.909
 to pursue the question 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.149
 the actions of the guests now and then 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:36.469
 if only one can be presented perhaps improved
