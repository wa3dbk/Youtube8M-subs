00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:12.064
Yesterday I found a butterfly

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:31.018
They are flying in the sky

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.399
Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:53.046
they are filling the sky

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Why are they so many?

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:07.027
The butterlfly is coloured

00:01:08.037 --> 00:01:10.009
orange and red

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.019
and also white and black points

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.051
They are super coloured

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:22.067
only a true artist can paint them that way

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.034
They are thousands of thousands

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:41.063
They're all eating

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:46.018
403,000... even more, many, many more!

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.200
I liked when... they were on the trees

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:05.019
This seems to me that it's eating

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.072
or it's resting...

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:16.038
this is a swarm of butterflies

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.055
They're too many|

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.599
They were flying

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:31.074
there are swarms of butterflies flying for kms

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:35.082
now this butterfly is resting on a girl

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.084
... on her hair

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800
A very special place...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.599
voices of the children

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.199
during the workshop in the coop
