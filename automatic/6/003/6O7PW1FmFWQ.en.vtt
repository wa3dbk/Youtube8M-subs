00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
basically you float up to it yeah this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.490 
basically you float up to it yeah this
is<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.480> play<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.470> looks

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
is my first time play but like it looks

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.670 
is my first time play but like it looks
like<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:22.949> floating<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:25.170> ski<00:00:25.470> no

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
like you just floating up and I ski no

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.120 
like you just floating up and I ski no
whoa<00:00:26.599> not<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> rocket<00:00:28.740> ship<00:00:28.949> must

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
whoa not there is the rocket ship must

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.780 
whoa not there is the rocket ship must
be<00:00:29.250> an<00:00:29.400> Astra<00:00:29.849> something<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.640> we

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
be an Astra something like that so we

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.200 
be an Astra something like that so we
can<00:00:33.090> around<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> guess

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.200 

whoa<00:00:40.210> whoa<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.920> this<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.700> your<00:00:42.730> spawning

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
whoa whoa and this is your spawning

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.930 
whoa whoa and this is your spawning
weapon<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.080> m16<00:00:44.710> here<00:00:45.210> well<00:00:46.210> shoddy<00:00:46.480> huh<00:00:47.940> so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
weapon the m16 here well shoddy huh so

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.000 
weapon the m16 here well shoddy huh so
basically<00:00:49.300> now<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.600> rocket<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.350> rocket<00:00:50.560> ship

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
basically now the rocket the rocket ship

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.750 
basically now the rocket the rocket ship
is<00:00:51.220> flying<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:52.000> now<00:00:52.600> we're<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:54.010> land<00:00:54.280> at

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
is flying and now we're going to land at

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.750 
is flying and now we're going to land at
the<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:56.140> moon<00:00:56.410> base<00:00:56.650> so<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.960> we<00:00:59.110> go<00:00:59.760> that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
the the moon base so here we go that

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.780 
the the moon base so here we go that
looks<00:01:00.790> like<00:01:01.120> I'm<00:01:01.239> floating<00:01:01.780> downward<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:03.640> is

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
maybe we should go back to the rock and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.719 
maybe we should go back to the rock and
go<00:02:04.730> somewhere<00:02:05.090> all<00:02:05.510> right<00:02:05.660> oh<00:02:05.930> crap<00:02:06.729> can't

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
go somewhere all right oh crap can't

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.419 
go somewhere all right oh crap can't
bring<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:08.060> graphic<00:02:08.840> oh<00:02:09.020> here<00:02:09.470> we<00:02:09.500> go<00:02:09.619> all<00:02:10.280> right

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
bring a graphic oh here we go all right

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.910 
bring a graphic oh here we go all right
now<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.150> we're<00:02:11.270> out<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.630> space<00:02:11.959> we're

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
now that we're out in the space we're

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.380 
now that we're out in the space we're
probably<00:02:13.190> gonna<00:02:13.370> start<00:02:13.700> floating<00:02:13.970> up<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
probably gonna start floating up in the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.750 
probably gonna start floating up in the
air<00:02:14.570> just<00:02:15.050> go<00:02:15.290> going<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.070> little<00:02:16.280> pad<00:02:16.490> right

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
air just go going that little pad right

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.750 
air just go going that little pad right
there<00:02:17.170> right<00:02:18.170> there<00:02:18.350> now<00:02:18.920> will<00:02:19.160> probably<00:02:19.580> let

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
there right there now will probably let

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.640 
there right there now will probably let
you<00:02:19.820> float<00:02:20.090> up<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.330> here<00:02:25.930> wow<00:02:26.930> that's<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
you float up in here wow that's the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.670 
you float up in here wow that's the
movies<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:29.060> rat<00:02:29.600> looks<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> moon<00:02:30.440> base

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
movies this rat looks like the moon base

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.380 
movies this rat looks like the moon base
right<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:31.790> right<00:02:31.940> now<00:02:33.040> what<00:02:34.040> looks<00:02:34.910> like<00:02:35.000> zero

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
right so right now what looks like zero

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.320 
right so right now what looks like zero
gravity<00:02:35.780> right<00:02:36.170> now<00:02:36.350> whoa<00:02:37.040> whoa<00:02:37.490> whoa<00:02:37.910> whoa

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
gravity right now whoa whoa whoa whoa

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.199 
gravity right now whoa whoa whoa whoa

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
some so like yeah I'm walking through

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.070 
some so like yeah I'm walking through
the<00:03:18.870> fog<00:03:19.140> right<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:20.480> looks<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.720> might

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
the fog right now looks like this might

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.990 
the fog right now looks like this might
be<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> structure<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.220> head<00:03:23.430> or<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:23.819> it's

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
be a structure of a head or so it's

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.600 
be a structure of a head or so it's
funny<00:03:24.209> how<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.290> map<00:03:25.530> counts<00:03:25.920> by<00:03:26.069> tens

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
funny how the this map counts by tens

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.230 
funny how the this map counts by tens
for<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.270> levels<00:03:27.630> pretty<00:03:28.050> weird<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:30.090> this

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
for the levels pretty weird but this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.840 
for the levels pretty weird but this
time<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:30.900> starting<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.500> by<00:03:31.650> twos<00:03:31.920> now<00:03:32.220> so

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
time it's starting to go by twos now so

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.880 
time it's starting to go by twos now so
basically<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.270> start<00:03:33.330> at<00:03:33.720> ten<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.739> goes

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
basically you start at ten and it goes

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.470 
basically you start at ten and it goes
to<00:03:35.069> two<00:03:35.250> out<00:03:35.790> 12<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.950> yeah<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:38.970> calyx

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
to two out 12 so yeah this is this calyx

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.250 
to two out 12 so yeah this is this calyx
wait<00:03:40.310> they<00:03:41.310> say<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:42.390> kind<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.050> looks<00:03:43.230> like<00:03:43.319> a

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
wait they say that kind of looks like a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.630
