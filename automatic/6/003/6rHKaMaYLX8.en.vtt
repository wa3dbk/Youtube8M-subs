00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
a well in the dry mix made a well I'm

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:41.940 
a well in the dry mix made a well I'm
gonna<00:03:30.370> put<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.730> water<00:03:31.629> right<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.139> there<00:03:40.950> yes

you can just keep rocking the bowl if
there's<00:03:45.639> not<00:03:45.849> enough<00:03:45.909> because<00:03:46.480> every<00:03:46.989> flower

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
there's not enough because every flower

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.349 
there's not enough because every flower
is<00:03:47.530> different<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:48.099> is<00:03:48.250> beautiful<00:03:48.879> organic

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
is different this is beautiful organic

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:56.250 
is different this is beautiful organic
white<00:03:49.780> flower<00:03:51.419> it<00:03:52.439> seems<00:03:53.439> to<00:03:53.680> me<00:03:53.799> they<00:03:55.260> it

white flower it seems to me they it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.319 
white flower it seems to me they it
absorbs<00:03:56.709> more<00:03:56.919> liquid<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.639> gotta<00:03:58.090> go<00:03:58.209> get

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
absorbs more liquid so I gotta go get

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:05.630 
absorbs more liquid so I gotta go get
some<00:03:58.389> more<00:03:58.599> water

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.450 

and<00:04:05.820> your<00:04:06.000> trick<00:04:06.270> with<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.860> add<00:04:08.070> your

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
and your trick with this is to add your

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.240 
and your trick with this is to add your
liquid<00:04:09.440> only<00:04:10.440> until<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.160> right

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
liquid only until it's the right

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:22.670 
liquid only until it's the right
consistency<00:04:11.820> now<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.690> bit<00:04:12.990> more<00:04:21.410> bitchy<00:04:22.410> that's

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
consistency now a bit more bitchy that's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.660 
consistency now a bit more bitchy that's
the<00:04:22.830> last<00:04:23.040> of<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.370> shouldn't<00:04:23.850> be<00:04:23.910> fine

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
the last of it shouldn't be fine

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.120 
the last of it shouldn't be fine
or<00:04:26.670> just<00:04:26.820> thick<00:04:27.030> as<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.180> cake<00:04:27.480> batter<00:04:30.920> as<00:04:31.920> much

or just thick as a cake batter as much
stirring<00:04:32.640> don't<00:04:32.880> stir<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.150> too<00:04:33.390> much<00:04:33.660> it's

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
stirring don't stir it too much it's

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.000 
stirring don't stir it too much it's
funny<00:04:35.210> cornbread<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.420> Bannock<00:04:37.040> funny<00:04:40.010> stir

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
funny cornbread and Bannock funny stir

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.980
