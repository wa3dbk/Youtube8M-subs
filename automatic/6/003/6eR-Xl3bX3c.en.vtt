00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hi, I'm Sant United and I'll leave you with the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 third part of the history of the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.240
 consoles where I'll talk about the third 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.900
 generation of consoles without giving more 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 rodeos 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.580
 let's start third generation of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.920
 consoles desktop consoles this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.099
 generation had a lapse of time of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 three years from 1984 to 1987 this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.330
 generation had very few consoles 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.420
 because the crisis of video games 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.010
 83 left this industry very affected and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890
 and everyone was engaged in doing 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.899
 computers and the consoles were almost 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 forgotten until the saving came 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.059
 of this industry the family with 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 nintendo was a tabletop console 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 launched in Japan in 1984 and is called the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 Savior of video games is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.399
 He had a console gaming system 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.590
 individual contents contained in cartridges and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 he also had a peripheral called 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 famicom disk system where their games 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.700
 they were contained on diskettes thanks 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.770
 to the popularity of the console was 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 thrown in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.450
 985 in America and in Europe but 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.550
 redesigned it had a system of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 individual games contained in 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.770
 cartridges and the console had the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.600
 name of nintendo entertainment system 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 also called nes thanks to his acronym 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.280
 this console unveiled great 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.920
 successful franchises like super mario 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.440
 bros and the legend of zelda then 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.660
 would arrive the only significant rival of 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.570
 nintendo in this generation and it would create 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.100
 with this company a great war came 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.660
 sega with his arga third segam thrown in 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 1985 in Japan and was the only one of the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.440
 few consoles that had at that time 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.720
 that was able to cope with 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.940
 nintendo just like your console 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.830
 rival gets redesigned his console and the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.240
 distributed with the name of sega master 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.250
 system in america and the rest of the world 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.869
 atari was already laying its foundations in 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.570
 the consoles and started doing 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.820
 computers in this generation pulled 3 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.100
 consoles were at all times 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.370
 the shadow of nintendo and sega these 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.350
 consoles were the atari 2600 juniors 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.210
 that it was a compact version 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.580
 and improved the atari 2600 launched in 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:26.090
 1986 and it's like saying a atari today 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.830
 2600 slim the atari 7,800 was released in 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 1986 and it was a console that did not succeed 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.170
 and also was forgotten as well 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.880
 that his predecessor the atari 5200 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 finally the atari x released in 1987 and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.710
 it was a console with an operating system 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.020
 of a atari micro computer and also 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.690
 a console without popularity or success 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.730
 this generation was according to many the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.370
 true first generation consoles 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.010
 although it was the third generation 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.230
 it was also nicknamed the war of the 8 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.470
 bits though their predecessor generations 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.630
 have also been 8 bits after 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.240
 this generation was that they started to 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.760
 use classifications by bits here 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.800
 they created the first so-called fanboys and 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.590
 hackers that still remain in a 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.310
 endless and absurd war 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.310
 this generation culminated in October 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.790
 1987 when the pc emerged 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.590
 jim and the fourth generation started now 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.090

 the consoles of sobremesa of that same 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.959

 they were the game and watts of nintendo and 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.030
 the game pocket of poch the nintendo game 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.459
 awards arose in 1981 but it was 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.620
 considered as a third-party console 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.199
 nintendo generation in this generation 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.539
 she was the queen of the consoles since 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.880
 nobody could with their nes and less with the 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.220
 game and watch this console was a 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.470
 calculator that could execute actions 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.990
 over images and only had one 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.900
 only game that was built had 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.690
 a line of 59 consoles where the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.150
 most popular game was donkey kong and he gave 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.639
 to know great franchises like super 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.100

 console was very successful and it was not 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.210
 until the exit of the nintendo game boy 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.910
 that was dethroned 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.220
 on the contrary the epoc game pocket was 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.740
 a total failure and could not snatch him 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.380
 the reign to the nintendo console this 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.199
