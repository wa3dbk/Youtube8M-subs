 arribaçã hello you know not arribaçã 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.420
 in this video we'll cover a little bit of this 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.889
 bird that is one of the Northeastern symbols 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.780
 both their life process and their 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.250
 reproduction and the fact that it is in the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 of ibama as an animal that can be 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.720
 make a threatened species maybe you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.390
 know the names or eared dove 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 night or even arrival bird 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 but what you do not know is that she is 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.250
 entering into a continuous process and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.250
 inexorable its extinction 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.860
 Well, since I can not go with you, I 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.860
 fiction 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.190
 the overflow is a migratory bird adapted 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.260
 the conditions of the semi - arid and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 uses sugarcane plantations 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.700
 to take shelter and today suffers to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.510
 food being considered a pest 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.510
 for farmers 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 the specifically black northeast race 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.489
 between the west-central regions of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 sertão passing by the rivers são francisco 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.130
 a geo motown seridó jaguaribe between 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 others 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.619
 renewal reproduces in colonies and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.200
 their nests are usually made in the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.200
 ground up to two eggs per litter 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 salted in the river where the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.619
 production occurs between the months of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.210
 February to August 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.280
 this time is the moment when they 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.869
 are more vulnerable due to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.869
 to the location of the egg laying 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.160
 indiscriminate hunting with great pressure 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 species that could harm their 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.340
 stocks 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.350
 hunters kill the adults and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.100
 puppies that trample eggs and flower

 club 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 the traps used, among them the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 sangrias also called arapucas 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.330
 made with several of quince use 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 maize and soybeans as bait and 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.939
 about 10 to 12 arrival of a single 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.250
 turn 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.070
 taking into account hunters 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.759
 have an average of 40 to 500 traps 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.709
 these 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.440
 the number of birds trapped in this way 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.360
 can quickly become worrying 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 but another direct problem is that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 pigeons are in the same place for about 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.680
 from 60 to 70 days 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.310
 see the egg laying until the flock 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 of pups when this period occurs 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.560
 generally between July and August coincides 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.329
 with the harvest of sugarcane for 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.549
 the man who in a plantation that 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.380
 will be collected causing the animation 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:43.280
 undocumented species 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.650
 I can not, it 's good, you? 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 ibama is in constant movement 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.780
 to ensure the monitoring of hunting 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.760
 predatory approach and prevent it from 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.100
 between direct risk of extinction 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.990
 we all have an obligation to protect 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.270
 our heritage being the relationship 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.340
 of these assets, we all have a duty 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.830
 to discourage predatory hunting and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.050
 denounce anyone who does so that our 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.940
 future generations to know and 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.050
 enjoy this responsibility 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.050
 delicacy of our land
