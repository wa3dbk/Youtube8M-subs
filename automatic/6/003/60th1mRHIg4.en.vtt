00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
processed to get that pattern

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
get it as close as possible to the one

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.869 
get it as close as possible to the one
you're<00:02:46.260> looking<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.579> you're<00:02:47.760> looking

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
you're looking at so if you're looking

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.400 
you're looking at so if you're looking
at<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.390> different<00:02:48.810> pictures<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
at the different pictures and the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.800 
at the different pictures and the
different<00:02:49.829> names<00:02:50.010> they<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:50.910> are<00:02:51.150> named<00:02:51.390> so

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
different names they all are named so

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.869 
different names they all are named so
you<00:02:52.109> can<00:02:52.349> distinguish<00:02:52.890> which<00:02:53.220> one<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.609> which

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
you can distinguish which one is which

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.089 
you can distinguish which one is which
some<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> title<00:02:55.109> wave<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
some have a title wave some have the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.699 
some have a title wave some have the
looser<00:02:56.310> wave<00:02:56.670> some<00:02:57.599> might<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.959> longer<00:02:58.230> so

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
looser wave some might be longer so

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.979 
looser wave some might be longer so
might<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.099> shorter<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.819> they<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> name<00:03:00.569> and

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
might be shorter so they have a name and

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.649 
might be shorter so they have a name and
then<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.799> select<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.400> limp<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.120> make

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
then you can select the limp and make

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.690 
then you can select the limp and make
sure<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.049> look<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> ounces<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.489> hair

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
sure to look for the ounces of the hair

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.910
