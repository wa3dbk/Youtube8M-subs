the can when it comes to a power supply
but<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.849> continuing<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:13.080> their

but they are continuing with their
original<00:00:14.009> philosophy<00:00:14.549> which<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:15.049> leading<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
original philosophy which was leading a

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.040 
original philosophy which was leading a
customer<00:00:16.710> support<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.580> their<00:00:17.940> PS<00:00:18.300> use<00:00:18.510> now

it's<00:00:19.199> hard<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.410> differentiate<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.100> power

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it's hard to differentiate a power

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.010 
it's hard to differentiate a power
supply<00:00:20.490> these<00:00:20.850> days<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> fan<00:00:21.720> it's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
supply these days it's got a fan it's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900 
supply these days it's got a fan it's
got<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> 24-pin<00:00:22.949> connector<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.550> got<00:00:23.730> like

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
got a 24-pin connector it's got like

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
got a 24-pin connector it's got like
power<00:00:24.269> end<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.080> probably<00:00:25.230> got<00:00:25.439> some

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
power end and it's probably got some

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.080 
power end and it's probably got some
kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:25.920> 80<00:00:26.039> plus<00:00:26.279> rating<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.849> case

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
kind of an 80 plus rating in this case

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
kind of an 80 plus rating in this case
it's<00:00:27.630> 80<00:00:27.930> plus<00:00:28.230> gold<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> i<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.160> where

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's 80 plus gold which is i think where

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.859 
it's 80 plus gold which is i think where
that<00:00:29.519> 90<00:00:30.179> comes<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.570> because<00:00:30.689> it's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that 90 comes from because it's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
that 90 comes from because it's
basically<00:00:31.470> ninety<00:00:32.219> percent<00:00:32.369> efficiency<00:00:32.730> but

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
basically ninety percent efficiency but

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.110 
basically ninety percent efficiency but
check<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> less<00:00:35.880> than

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
check this out this is the less than

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.910 
check this out this is the less than
three<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.020> their<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:37.500> heart<00:00:37.739> rate

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
three which is their little heart rate

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160 
three which is their little heart rate
here<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.670> two<00:00:38.850> steps<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.390> there's<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
here so it's two steps if there's a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
here so it's two steps if there's a
problem<00:00:40.440> within<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> five-year<00:00:41.460> warranty

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
problem within the five-year warranty

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
problem within the five-year warranty
period<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.329> your<00:00:42.420> power<00:00:42.570> supply<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.620> will

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
period for your power supply they will

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
period for your power supply they will
not<00:00:44.219> only<00:00:44.579> pay<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> ship<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.329> back<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
not only pay to ship it back to you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.630 
not only pay to ship it back to you
which<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.320> companies<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.520> they

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
which is what most companies do but they

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.090 
which is what most companies do but they
will<00:00:47.789> also<00:00:48.090> pay<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> simply<00:00:49.770> schedule

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
will also pay for you to simply schedule

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150 
will also pay for you to simply schedule
a<00:00:50.399> pick<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.050> ship<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.079> back<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.890> on

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
a pick up and ship it back to them on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.240 
a pick up and ship it back to them on
their<00:00:53.640> dime<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> idea<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.590> an<00:00:55.770> RMA

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
their dime so the idea is that an RMA

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.889 
their dime so the idea is that an RMA
shouldn't<00:00:56.640> cost<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> customer<00:00:57.180> anything

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
shouldn't cost the customer anything

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
shouldn't cost the customer anything
even<00:00:58.590> though<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.399> industry

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
even though that is not the industry

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180 
even though that is not the industry

residents<00:01:02.670> only<00:01:02.820> apparently<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
residents only apparently but there you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
residents only apparently but there you
go<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.920> they're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
go that's what they're going for here so

with<00:01:17.970> their<00:01:18.090> packaging<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.659> they've<00:01:18.810> got<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
with their packaging so they've got a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
with their packaging so they've got a
nice<00:01:19.170> soft<00:01:19.860> foam<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> gives<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
nice soft foam here that gives you a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.190 
nice soft foam here that gives you a
nice<00:01:21.030> little<00:01:21.240> look<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> power<00:01:21.900> supply

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
nice little look at the power supply

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080 
nice little look at the power supply
through<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.560> window<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> top<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.580> then

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
through that window in the top and then

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.870 
through that window in the top and then
they've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.740> very<00:01:25.740> stylish<00:01:26.640> white<00:01:27.030> bag

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
they've got a very stylish white bag

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
they've got a very stylish white bag
that<00:01:29.880> includes<00:01:30.240> all<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> cables<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that includes all of the cables that you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
that includes all of the cables that you
need<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.579> fully<00:01:32.790> modular<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.540> said

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
need so it's fully modular like I said

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.120 
need so it's fully modular like I said
before<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.200> means<00:01:34.439> you've<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
before which means you've got a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
detachable 24-pin connector actually you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
detachable 24-pin connector actually you
know<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.770> let's<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> let's<00:01:39.180> get

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
know what let's get into the let's get

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
know what let's get into the let's get
into<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> cables<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.380> after

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
into the cables a little bit more after

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.639 
into the cables a little bit more after
so<00:01:41.820> you've<00:01:42.180> got<00:01:42.360> power<00:01:42.750> assurance<00:01:43.350> look<00:01:43.560> at

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so you've got power assurance look at

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
so you've got power assurance look at
that<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:44.310> include<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:44.909> QC<00:01:45.299> thing<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that they include a little QC thing so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
that they include a little QC thing so
they<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.680> 45<00:01:47.100> degree<00:01:47.430> burn<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.079> they<00:01:49.079> do

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
they do a 45 degree burn in they do

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.639 
they do a 45 degree burn in they do
initial<00:01:49.920> test<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.460> check<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> soldering

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
initial test they check the soldering

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.109 
initial test they check the soldering
secondary<00:01:53.149> neat<00:01:54.149> neat<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.229> mean<00:01:55.470> obviously<00:01:56.119> you

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
secondary neat neat I mean obviously you

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
secondary neat neat I mean obviously you
know<00:01:57.240> QC<00:01:57.780> gets<00:01:58.020> done<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.560> point<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.040> most

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
know QC gets done at some point for most

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.649 
know QC gets done at some point for most
products<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> fact<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.390> include

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
products but the fact that they include

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.819 
products but the fact that they include
that<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that for you I think it's just kind of

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
that for you I think it's just kind of
neat<00:02:01.979> users<00:02:02.579> manual<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.210> available<00:02:03.299> in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
neat users manual so it's available in

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.139 
neat users manual so it's available in
850<00:02:04.320> watts<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.829> thousand<00:02:05.159> watts<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> 1200

850 watts a thousand watts and 1200

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.119 
850 watts a thousand watts and 1200
watts<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.409> leaves<00:02:07.590> us<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:08.039> much

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
watts and that leaves us pretty much

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.190 
watts and that leaves us pretty much
with<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.970> power<00:02:09.239> cable<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> power

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
with the power cable and then the power

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
with the power cable and then the power
supply<00:02:10.470> itself<00:02:10.770> look<00:02:11.340> at<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.610> they're<00:02:11.849> using

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
supply itself look at that they're using

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.750 
supply itself look at that they're using
the<00:02:13.200> higher<00:02:13.470> current<00:02:13.860> connector<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the higher current connector for the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.640 
the higher current connector for the
back<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.150> power<00:02:15.330> supply<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.140> spite<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
back of the power supply in spite of the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.990 
back of the power supply in spite of the
fact<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.370> thousand<00:02:17.730> watt<00:02:17.819> unit

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
fact that it's just a thousand watt unit

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.089 
fact that it's just a thousand watt unit
it's<00:02:18.239> not<00:02:18.390> necessary<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.260> including<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.800> beefy

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
it's not necessary but including a beefy

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.699 
it's not necessary but including a beefy
power<00:02:20.280> cable<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.879> not<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> bad<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.410> by

rubberized finish so this isn't metal so
the<00:03:18.900> metal<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.260> actually<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.950> white

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the metal is actually just the white

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.860 
the metal is actually just the white
part<00:03:20.400> here<00:03:20.459> which<00:03:21.060> feels<00:03:21.359> like<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.600> very

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
part here which feels like a very

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.150 
part here which feels like a very
durable<00:03:22.109> paint<00:03:22.440> finish<00:03:22.709> it's<00:03:22.859> got<00:03:22.980> some

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
durable paint finish it's got some

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.590 
durable paint finish it's got some
texture<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.030> not<00:03:24.180> gonna<00:03:24.329> worry

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
texture to it so I'm not gonna worry

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.090 
texture to it so I'm not gonna worry
about<00:03:24.660> accidentally<00:03:25.319> scratching<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.829> that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
about accidentally scratching it that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.940 
about accidentally scratching it that
was<00:03:26.190> my<00:03:26.220> one<00:03:26.489> complaint<00:03:26.760> about<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.840> old<00:03:28.170> ocz

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
was my one complaint about the old ocz

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.699 
was my one complaint about the old ocz
power<00:03:29.310> stream<00:03:29.819> 520<00:03:30.630> awesome<00:03:31.079> power<00:03:31.260> supply

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
power stream 520 awesome power supply

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.770 
power stream 520 awesome power supply

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
single strong 12 volt rail back in the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.690 
single strong 12 volt rail back in the
days<00:03:33.959> when<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.349> wasn't<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.709> common<00:03:35.160> but

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
days when that wasn't that common but

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.190 
days when that wasn't that common but
the<00:03:35.880> finish<00:03:36.239> on<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.450> thing<00:03:36.750> was<00:03:36.870> terrible

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the finish on that thing was terrible

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.449 
the finish on that thing was terrible
you<00:03:37.319> installed<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.920> system<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.370> then

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
you installed it in the system and then

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.610 
you installed it in the system and then
it<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.670> looked<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.530> other

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
it just looked like but on the other

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.259 
it just looked like but on the other
side<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.370> see<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.669> they've<00:03:41.849> got<00:03:41.880> it

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
side so you can see that they've got it

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.270 
side so you can see that they've got it
such<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.319> can<00:03:43.500> install<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.889> either<00:03:44.010> way

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
such that you can install it either way

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.400 
such that you can install it either way
and<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.940> text<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.480> side<00:03:45.660> will<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:45.989> correct

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
and the text on the side will be correct

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.530 
and the text on the side will be correct
see<00:03:46.980> there<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.370> go<00:03:47.519> you've<00:03:47.970> got<00:03:48.180> another

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
see there you go you've got another

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.360 
see there you go you've got another
rubber<00:03:48.780> strip<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.290> looks<00:03:49.590> equally<00:03:49.950> good<00:03:50.190> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
rubber strip that looks equally good and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.159 
rubber strip that looks equally good and
then<00:03:50.519> there's<00:03:50.700> your<00:03:50.940> modular<00:03:51.540> interface<00:03:52.019> so

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
then there's your modular interface so

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.780 
then there's your modular interface so
we're<00:03:52.290> gonna<00:03:52.380> go<00:03:52.709> ahead<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.190> pull<00:03:53.489> out<00:03:53.609> all<00:03:53.760> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
we're gonna go ahead and pull out all of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.370 
we're gonna go ahead and pull out all of
the<00:03:53.970> cables<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.419> we'll<00:03:54.900> be<00:03:54.989> back<00:03:55.109> in<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.290> moment

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the cables and we'll be back in a moment

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.319 
the cables and we'll be back in a moment
so<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.069> terms<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.400> modular<00:03:56.849> connectors

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
so in terms of modular connectors

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.349 
so in terms of modular connectors
there's<00:03:57.660> actually<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.410> very<00:03:59.250> wide<00:03:59.609> variety<00:03:59.849> so

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
there's actually a very wide variety so

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.069 
there's actually a very wide variety so
check<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.690> out

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
check this out

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.390 
check this out
these<00:04:01.590> are<00:04:02.130> all<00:04:02.750> PCI<00:04:03.750> Express<00:04:04.139> here<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.950> six

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
these are all PCI Express here so six

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.240 
these are all PCI Express here so six
six<00:04:06.120> plus<00:04:06.329> two<00:04:06.540> connectors<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.829> is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
six plus two connectors and this is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.250 
six plus two connectors and this is
actually<00:04:08.730> quite<00:04:09.030> nice<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:09.870> even

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
actually quite nice to see so even

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.030 
actually quite nice to see so even
though<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.380> lot<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.709> power<00:04:10.950> supplies<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:12.120> have

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
though a lot of power supplies that have

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.740 
though a lot of power supplies that have
flat<00:04:14.040> cables<00:04:14.579> for<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.910> molex<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:15.510> SATA

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
flat cables for the molex and SATA

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.460 
flat cables for the molex and SATA
connectors<00:04:16.260> you'll<00:04:16.769> see<00:04:18.260> you'll<00:04:19.260> see<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
connectors you'll see you'll see a

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.080 
connectors you'll see you'll see a
sleeved<00:04:19.889> connector<00:04:20.370> four<00:04:20.549> PCIe

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
sleeved connector four PCIe

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.990 
sleeved connector four PCIe
but<00:04:21.570> instead<00:04:21.959> NZXT<00:04:22.650> has<00:04:22.950> opted<00:04:23.430> for<00:04:23.669> flat

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
but instead NZXT has opted for flat

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480 
but instead NZXT has opted for flat
ribbon<00:04:24.210> cables<00:04:24.360> even<00:04:25.289> for<00:04:25.469> PCI<00:04:25.770> Express<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
ribbon cables even for PCI Express the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.430 
ribbon cables even for PCI Express the
it's<00:04:26.759> also<00:04:26.880> quite<00:04:27.509> optimal<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.199> you're<00:04:28.320> gonna

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
it's also quite optimal so you're gonna

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.140 
it's also quite optimal so you're gonna
be<00:04:28.620> able<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.009> manage<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.460> cables<00:04:29.789> behind<00:04:29.910> your

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
be able to manage the cables behind your

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.909 
be able to manage the cables behind your
motherboard<00:04:30.360> tray<00:04:30.720> bring<00:04:31.350> them<00:04:31.470> out<00:04:31.650> behind

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
motherboard tray bring them out behind

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.460 
motherboard tray bring them out behind
your<00:04:32.220> video<00:04:32.490> card<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.539> mean<00:04:33.690> it's<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:34.289> nice

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
your video card and I mean it's so nice

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.550 
your video card and I mean it's so nice
because<00:04:34.680> most<00:04:35.690> most<00:04:36.690> video<00:04:37.020> cards<00:04:37.380> these<00:04:37.500> days

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
because most most video cards these days

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.170 
because most most video cards these days
on<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:37.979> high<00:04:38.100> performance<00:04:38.610> side<00:04:38.820> have<00:04:39.030> at

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
on the high performance side have at

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.870 
on the high performance side have at
least<00:04:39.479> two<00:04:40.110> PCIe<00:04:40.620> connectors<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.340> them<00:04:41.490> so

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
least two PCIe connectors on them so

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.400 
least two PCIe connectors on them so
what's<00:04:42.060> great<00:04:42.240> about<00:04:42.360> having<00:04:42.600> these<00:04:43.020> flat

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
what's great about having these flat

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.860 
what's great about having these flat
cables<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.729> can<00:04:44.910> easily<00:04:45.180> run<00:04:45.660> them

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
cables is that you can easily run them

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.460 
cables is that you can easily run them
somewhere<00:04:46.560> together<00:04:47.449> see<00:04:48.449> that<00:04:48.630> without<00:04:49.110> them

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
somewhere together see that without them

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.469 
somewhere together see that without them
actually<00:04:49.949> taking<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.430> much<00:04:50.729> additional<00:04:51.000> bulk

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
actually taking up much additional bulk

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.450 
actually taking up much additional bulk
at<00:04:51.780> all<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.590> then<00:04:52.770> when<00:04:52.919> they<00:04:53.009> reach<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
at all so then when they reach the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.080 
at all so then when they reach the
destination

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
destination

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.210 
destination
it<00:04:54.240> doesn't<00:04:54.720> look<00:04:54.840> untidy<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.440> gross<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:56.039> just

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
it doesn't look untidy and gross it just

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.279 
it doesn't look untidy and gross it just
looks<00:04:56.430> very<00:04:56.639> very<00:04:57.210> clean<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.930> from<00:04:58.169> an

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
looks very very clean so from an

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.140 
looks very very clean so from an
aesthetic<00:04:58.680> standpoint<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:59.460> think<00:04:59.940> these<00:05:00.090> are

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
aesthetic standpoint I think these are

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.310 
aesthetic standpoint I think these are
this<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.690> one<00:05:00.810> of<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.990> nicest

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
this is one of the nicest

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.810 
this is one of the nicest
implementations<00:05:02.039> I've<00:05:02.190> ever<00:05:02.370> seen<00:05:02.639> of<00:05:02.789> that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
implementations I've ever seen of that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.480 
implementations I've ever seen of that
so<00:05:03.180> kudos<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.810> NZXT<00:05:04.440> for<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:04.830> you've<00:05:05.310> also

the<00:05:26.789> 24<00:05:27.240> pin<00:05:27.389> connector<00:05:27.780> is<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.990> only<00:05:28.199> one

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
the 24 pin connector is the only one

the 24 pin connector is the only one

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
it as opposed to a flat connector I'd

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.820 
it as opposed to a flat connector I'd
love<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.240> see<00:05:33.360> someone<00:05:33.539> implement<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.080> flat<00:05:34.349> 24

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
love to see someone implement a flat 24

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.860 
love to see someone implement a flat 24
pin<00:05:35.039> and<00:05:35.220> then<00:05:35.729> if<00:05:35.849> I<00:05:35.940> had<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.419> complain<00:05:36.750> about

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
pin and then if I had to complain about

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.620 
pin and then if I had to complain about
the<00:05:37.080> power<00:05:37.289> supply<00:05:37.740> which<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.729> guess<00:05:38.909> I<00:05:39.090> sort<00:05:39.539> of

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
the power supply which I guess I sort of

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.379 
the power supply which I guess I sort of
I'm<00:05:39.870> supposed<00:05:40.260> to<00:05:40.440> I'd<00:05:41.430> say<00:05:41.639> not<00:05:41.880> enough<00:05:42.150> SATA

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
I'm supposed to I'd say not enough SATA

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.939 
I'm supposed to I'd say not enough SATA
so<00:05:43.050> we've<00:05:43.289> got<00:05:44.690> three<00:05:45.690> quad<00:05:46.110> SATA<00:05:46.440> harnesses

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
so we've got three quad SATA harnesses

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.250 
so we've got three quad SATA harnesses
which<00:05:47.099> is<00:05:47.250> up<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.580> 12<00:05:47.820> connectors<00:05:48.330> but<00:05:48.990> I'd

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
which is up to 12 connectors but I'd

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.110 
which is up to 12 connectors but I'd
like<00:05:49.409> to<00:05:49.560> see<00:05:49.740> more<00:05:49.919> of<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.159> mixture<00:05:50.520> so<00:05:50.820> maybe<00:05:51.030> a

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
like to see more of a mixture so maybe a

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.360 
like to see more of a mixture so maybe a
couple<00:05:51.449> quad<00:05:51.870> ones<00:05:52.139> and<00:05:52.440> a<00:05:52.470> couple<00:05:52.710> dual<00:05:53.130> ones

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
couple quad ones and a couple dual ones

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.680 
couple quad ones and a couple dual ones
because<00:05:53.789> you're<00:05:53.940> not<00:05:54.060> always<00:05:54.270> going<00:05:54.510> to<00:05:54.599> be

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
because you're not always going to be

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.580 
because you're not always going to be
running<00:05:54.870> them<00:05:55.050> somewhere<00:05:55.380> where<00:05:55.530> you

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
running them somewhere where you

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.810 
running them somewhere where you
actually<00:05:55.740> have<00:05:56.039> to<00:05:56.070> connect<00:05:56.400> four<00:05:56.580> devices

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
actually have to connect four devices

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.360 
actually have to connect four devices
and<00:05:57.240> we<00:05:57.900> really<00:05:58.169> don't<00:05:58.289> need<00:05:58.500> this<00:05:58.680> much<00:05:58.919> molex

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
and we really don't need this much molex

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.360 
and we really don't need this much molex
anymore<00:05:59.789> so<00:06:00.030> we've<00:06:00.210> got<00:06:00.449> a<00:06:00.770> triple<00:06:01.770> molex<00:06:02.159> with

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
anymore so we've got a triple molex with

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.089 
anymore so we've got a triple molex with
a<00:06:02.400> floppy<00:06:02.729> we've<00:06:03.389> got<00:06:03.630> not<00:06:03.930> triple<00:06:04.500> molex<00:06:04.889> with

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
a floppy we've got not triple molex with

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.450 
a floppy we've got not triple molex with
a<00:06:05.130> floppy<00:06:05.460> we've<00:06:06.210> got<00:06:06.479> a<00:06:07.039> triple<00:06:08.039> Boulard

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
a floppy we've got a triple Boulard

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.249 
a floppy we've got a triple Boulard
quadruple<00:06:09.030> molex<00:06:09.449> and<00:06:09.720> then<00:06:09.960> we've<00:06:10.080> got

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
quadruple molex and then we've got

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.350 
quadruple molex and then we've got
another<00:06:10.349> quadruple<00:06:10.919> molex<00:06:11.280> I'd<00:06:11.669> say<00:06:11.880> SATA<00:06:12.150> is

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
another quadruple molex I'd say SATA is

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.939 
another quadruple molex I'd say SATA is
a<00:06:12.389> much<00:06:12.630> more<00:06:12.780> common<00:06:13.080> connector<00:06:13.590> now<00:06:13.710> than

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
a much more common connector now than

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.310 
a much more common connector now than
molex<00:06:14.340> these<00:06:14.550> days<00:06:14.789> so<00:06:15.150> I<00:06:15.720> wouldn't<00:06:16.229> have

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
molex these days so I wouldn't have

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.080 
molex these days so I wouldn't have

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090
