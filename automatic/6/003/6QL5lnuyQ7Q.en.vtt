conditions<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.490> let's<00:01:38.610> pull<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.850> off<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
conditions so let's pull them off to the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.150 
conditions so let's pull them off to the
side<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.860> back<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
side so go and just back to the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.010 
side so go and just back to the
Lightning<00:01:41.610> connector<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.300> can<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
Lightning connector as we can see it is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
Lightning connector as we can see it is
quite<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.740> small<00:01:43.979> enough<00:01:44.220> far<00:01:44.460> we've

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
quite actually small enough far we've

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
quite actually small enough far we've
seen<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> pictures<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
seen a lot of pictures of this in the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
seen a lot of pictures of this in the
media<00:01:46.530> close-up<00:01:47.280> shots<00:01:47.550> with<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.880> when

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
media close-up shots with it but when

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
media close-up shots with it but when
you<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.150> get<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.540> hand<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.840> see

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you actually get in the hand then see

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
you actually get in the hand then see
how<00:01:49.050> small<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.100> definitely<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.550> lot

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
how small is it definitely is a lot

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.749 
how small is it definitely is a lot
smaller<00:01:51.000> than<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> old<00:01:51.600> connector<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
smaller than the old connector now on to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.650 
smaller than the old connector now on to
the<00:01:53.790> star<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.300> show<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.869> iphone<00:01:55.200> 5<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
the star of the show the iphone 5 I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.910 
the star of the show the iphone 5 I
always<00:01:57.660> like<00:01:57.900> peeling<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.350> plastic<00:01:58.740> off

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
always like peeling this plastic off

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
always like peeling this plastic off
quite<00:01:59.340> satisfying<00:01:59.900> so<00:02:00.900> here<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
quite satisfying so here we have the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.890 
quite satisfying so here we have the
iphone<00:02:01.740> 5<00:02:02.210> definitely<00:02:03.210> feels<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.630> light<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
iphone 5 definitely feels very light and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.950 
iphone 5 definitely feels very light and
thin<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.380> we'll<00:02:04.620> say<00:02:04.830> off<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> bat<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.930> not<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
thin and we'll say off the bat and not a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.690 
thin and we'll say off the bat and not a
huge<00:02:07.230> difference<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.800> design<00:02:08.130> now<00:02:08.519> I've<00:02:08.670> seen

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
huge difference in design now I've seen

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.090 
huge difference in design now I've seen
it<00:02:08.850> close<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.840> definitely<00:02:10.200> does<00:02:10.410> feel<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it close up but definitely does feel a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.820 
it close up but definitely does feel a
lot<00:02:11.519> lighter<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> thinner<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:13.410> think<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
lot lighter and thinner I do think it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
lot lighter and thinner I do think it
does<00:02:13.950> feel<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.310> bit<00:02:14.610> nicer<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.300> hand

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
does feel a little bit nicer in the hand

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.370 
does feel a little bit nicer in the hand
over<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> iphone<00:02:17.010> 4s<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.900> would<00:02:18.900> say<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> edges

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
over the iphone 4s I would say the edges

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.140 
over the iphone 4s I would say the edges
the<00:02:19.500> phone<00:02:19.709> don't<00:02:19.950> feel<00:02:20.220> quite<00:02:20.550> as<00:02:20.700> sharp<00:02:20.880> as

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the phone don't feel quite as sharp as

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.270 
the phone don't feel quite as sharp as
they<00:02:21.239> did<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> iphone<00:02:21.959> 4s<00:02:22.410> he's<00:02:23.130> been<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
they did with the iphone 4s he's been a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
they did with the iphone 4s he's been a
little<00:02:23.340> difference<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.330> enough<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
little difference but it's enough to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840 
little difference but it's enough to
like<00:02:24.930> feel<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.799> nicer<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> hand<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
like feel it so it's nicer in the hand I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.780 
like feel it so it's nicer in the hand I
would<00:02:27.000> say<00:02:27.180> overall<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.620> here's<00:02:28.860> my<00:02:28.950> iphone<00:02:29.459> 4

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
would say overall so here's my iphone 4

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.390 
would say overall so here's my iphone 4
and<00:02:30.000> comparing<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.230> see<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:32.130> look

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and comparing it you can see they look

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.830 
and comparing it you can see they look
very<00:02:32.430> similar<00:02:32.670> obviously<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.570> there's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
very similar obviously but there's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.000 
very similar obviously but there's
definitely<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.200> difference<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> height

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
definitely a difference in the height

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.210 
definitely a difference in the height
and<00:02:35.959> look<00:02:36.959> at<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.140> screen<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.739> it's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and look at the screen there it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.979 
and look at the screen there it's
definitely<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.450> Billy<00:02:39.630> different

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
definitely is not so Billy different

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.600 
definitely is not so Billy different
which<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.440> nice<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.160> stuff<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.459> bigger

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
which is nice and I stuff that bigger

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.840 
which is nice and I stuff that bigger
screen<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.769> fitness<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.489> if<00:02:44.549> it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
screen and fitness I don't know if it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.190 
screen and fitness I don't know if it
shows<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.120> well<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.570> video<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.080> it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
shows up well in this video but it

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600 
shows up well in this video but it
definitely<00:02:46.410> feels<00:02:46.680> fit<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> hand<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
definitely feels fit in the hand and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.150 
definitely feels fit in the hand and
it's<00:02:48.239> obviously<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.019> found<00:02:49.320> far<00:02:49.590> was<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> thin

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it's obviously I found far was a thin

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's obviously I found far was a thin
phone<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.000> definitely<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> noticeable

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
phone but definitely is a noticeable

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.470 
phone but definitely is a noticeable
difference<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:53.820> leave<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> unboxing

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
difference so we leave the unboxing

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.270 
difference so we leave the unboxing
there<00:02:54.690> keep<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.049> sharp<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.130> want<00:02:56.250> to
