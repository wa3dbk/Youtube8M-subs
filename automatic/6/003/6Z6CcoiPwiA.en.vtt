if<00:00:03.460> you<00:00:03.610> think<00:00:03.760> natural<00:00:04.330> harmonics<00:00:04.900> are<00:00:05.020> good

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 
if you think natural harmonics are good

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.280 
if you think natural harmonics are good
you<00:00:05.590> really<00:00:05.890> enjoy<00:00:06.490> false<00:00:06.819> harmonics<00:00:07.420> I<00:00:07.720> don't

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290

what<00:01:52.939> I'm<00:01:53.060> actually<00:01:53.210> doing<00:01:53.509> is<00:01:54.409> playing<00:01:54.860> a

what I'm actually doing is playing a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.940 

then<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.869> harmonica<00:02:09.240> Lord<00:02:10.240> rennard's<00:02:10.950> all

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
then the harmonica Lord rennard's all

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.559 
then the harmonica Lord rennard's all
right<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.610> know<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.510> Mary<00:02:13.780> note<00:02:14.819> harmonic<00:02:15.819> an

right I know it Mary note harmonic an
ordinary<00:02:17.200> note<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.220> get

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:39.180 

this<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.630> bar<00:02:29.170> at<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.390> 6th<00:02:31.390> fret

sometimes<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.129> even<00:02:49.340> use<00:02:49.760> pull-ups

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.310
