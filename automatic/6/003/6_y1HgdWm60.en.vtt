00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 it's a good day to travel to the triangle 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.510
 of the Bermuda shorts 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.990
 there come the boys who will travel 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.990
 with me 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.010
 there is the plane driver we are going 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.080
 I hope we survive there in the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.080
 triangle has been lost and many people 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.800
 Hi, driver, we're here 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.490
 good guys, I want to tell you that 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.200
 travel to the triangle of Bermuda is 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.680
 very risky since it has been lost 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.680
 many people ok driver we are 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.570
 fortunate to travel to there we are 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.570
 ready to go as we train 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.900
 too much to go and we're going lucky to 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.900
 everyone 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 checking the plane so there is not 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.600
 no problem I will leave the pilot 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.600
 automatic to see how the kids go 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.420
 driver and how much is very little needed 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.600
 about an hour 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.640
 driver believes that we survive is me 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.330
 scary is not that lose the faith 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.330
 boys 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.780
 I will return to handle the plane rest 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.000
 until we get there 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.729
 It is very cloudy and raining and we lose 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.479
 control driver shit we will die 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.430
 we lose control I do not want to die for 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.799
 please driver I'm too young to die 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.720
 but we lose control if we die 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.090
 We will be proud to travel to 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.219
 Bermuda Triangle 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.219
 symbol tell my wife that I love her 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.670
 oaxaca and you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.490
 then we survive but we are in the middle 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.490
 out of nowhere something swallows us down 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.079
 marine to the air 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.079
 driver I am very afraid 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.830
 we are in the background breathing or in a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.390
 Lost City native will be here this 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.210
 every time I get more afraid I want to 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.490
 Mom like that is not giving much fear 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.470
 driver we make wait 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.590
 quietly if someone remembers 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 we 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020
 I have received reports of lost people 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.820
 in the 'triangle of Bermuda' 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.250
 they traveled at one thirty 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.290
 approximately they arrived there at ten o'clock 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.100
 at night his plane disappeared from the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.350
 nothing and there is no trace on the radar 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.990
 do not worry we'll take a few units 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.820
 to the triangle of Bermuda we're going 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.310
 Let's start with the mission of saving the 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.770

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 other side 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.200
 I hope we save these guys 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.780

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.690
