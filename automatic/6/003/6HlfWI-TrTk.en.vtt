00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.080
Let's go!

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:08.534
There's another match coming!

00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:15.880
What's up, dude?

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:19.731
You've shown the goal
I scored, right?

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:20.790
It was a masterpiece!

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:24.046
Take a look at Crispim's backpack!

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:28.333
Take a look at his backpack,
he's going to travel using that!

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:29.160
Take a look!

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:05.034
It's 3-3,

00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:08.145
we let you guys tie the dispute,
now we're going to win again.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:10.427
I won't stop mocking you!

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:12.370
There's no way out!

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:14.312
Robinho, Elano...

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:16.188
We must make some changes,

00:01:16.838 --> 00:01:19.598
we have to do something about
our team, things can't stay the same,

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:21.726
the blue team is...

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.062
Your team is psychologically shaken.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.840
- It isn't, let me say something...
- It's shaken...

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:29.323
- 3-3, now it's getting better!
- It is not!

00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:30.897
It's bad for you guys.

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:34.835
If we had been winning,
we'd have a huge advantage.

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:36.279
Your problem is...

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.554
If we had won 3 more matches,
the score would be 6-6.

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.232
we let them tie the dispute!

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.173
Take a look at the images, after
they started recording the matches...

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:46.302
- Take a look at YouTube!
- They can't film the matches!

00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:51.213
Blood and urine tests should
be carried out on them,

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:53.943
they must be sick!

00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:57.348
He was talking about
my backpack,

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.143
but take a look at his shoes!

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.109
They're great!

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.902
You can buy them,
they're great!

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:11.993
They are great, as well as
Lucas' backpack and Zeca's hat!

00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:14.162
You gotta be kidding me!

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.472
I hope we manage
to play well,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.348
- we're very happy...
- We destroyed you in the last match!

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.188
- and I hope I manage to play well...
- We destroyed you in the last match!

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.750
You haven't won a match
in three weeks!

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.724
I hope I manage to play well,

00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:54.298
but the victory
is what really matters.
