00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.530

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.950

 hot 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.900

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.900

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.210
 and let's see 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.210
 the good figurine 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.680
 well in a little bag 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.969
 then 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 for ages 6 or more needed 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.360
 time to open it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.540
 Well well here it says that it has 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.030
 four pieces that is a toy for 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 build 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.260
 let's do 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 disarmed 6 more than what was coming 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.459
 but good 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.540
 the sachet 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.020
 and if you see here the little piece comes this is 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.020
 the body 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.830
 these are the legs 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.569
 is the little head 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.690
 and of course 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.820
 the piece of chase mate 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.960
 Well, I'm going to put it together in a second 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.430
 so we can see it 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.969
 let's go say these parts in front 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.969
 well here 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 we put the head 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.870
 yes 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.980
 and that blond skinny 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.850
 more or less good 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.130
 others are independent because here 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.130
 we have to know how to try to approach 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.690
 a brito focuses on 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.790
 wait a second that the camera is I know 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.790
 what I'm going to put manual focus 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.270
 always brings it closer 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.270
 Hi I am 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.780
 Well, here you can see it 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.229
 is very small the truth is that we 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.820
 I was expecting a little bit bigger to see a 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.880
 second that promotes autofocus 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.990
 and ready 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.990
 I was waiting for her a little bit bigger 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.410
 but the truth is that it is very nice 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.410
 well 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.749

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:56.580
 some figurine 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.580

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.869
 Well, I have 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.110
 amorÃ³s and over there behind 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.110
 I also have some notions 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.370
 Well this cake does not help 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.370
 nothing around save 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.370

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.700

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.560
