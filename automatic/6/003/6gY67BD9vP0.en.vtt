let's start with my ease Thunder a as

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.960 
let's start with my ease Thunder a as
ease<00:00:25.769> own<00:00:26.010> immunity<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.359> he's<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.660> anime<00:00:28.080> type

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
ease own immunity so he's an anime type

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.490 
ease own immunity so he's an anime type
we<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.210> different<00:00:30.869> types<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
we have the different types which is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.569 
we have the different types which is
anima<00:00:32.189> breaker<00:00:33.050> guardian<00:00:34.250> Oracle<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.370> Lord

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
anima breaker guardian Oracle and Lord

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.270 
anima breaker guardian Oracle and Lord
five<00:00:36.149> types<00:00:36.829> anima<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.870> type<00:00:40.140> matters<00:00:40.920> when

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
five types anima the type matters when

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.729 
five types anima the type matters when
you<00:00:41.370> level<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.420> there's<00:00:42.870> HP<00:00:43.410> attack

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you level up like there's HP attack

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.889 
you level up like there's HP attack
defense<00:00:44.190> re<00:00:44.820> C<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> recovery<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
defense re C which is recovery and

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
defense re C which is recovery and
depending<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.110> type<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.770> stats<00:00:50.250> may

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
depending on your type your stats may

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.180 
depending on your type your stats may
differ<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.980> anima<00:00:53.579> type<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:54.059> does<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.390> do

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
differ so anima type what does it do

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.979 
differ so anima type what does it do
whenever<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.340> level<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.420> HP

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
whenever you level up you get more HP

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.860 
whenever you level up you get more HP
but<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.859> less<00:00:59.190> recovery<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.270> compared

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
but you get less recovery that compared

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
but you get less recovery that compared
to<00:01:00.899> other<00:01:01.079> types<00:01:02.359> it<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:05.010> some<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.729> best

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to other types it is to some the best

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
to other types it is to some the best
type<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:07.490> I've<00:01:08.490> seen<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.450> Japanese

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
type like I've seen some Japanese

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.980 
type like I've seen some Japanese
content<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.710> apparently<00:01:11.430> anima<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.689> best

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
content and apparently anima is the best

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
content and apparently anima is the best
because<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.460> survivability<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
because it's best for survivability and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.630 
because it's best for survivability and
then<00:01:15.420> Guardian<00:01:15.840> next<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.920> I'll<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.400> to

but oh well breaker breaker increases

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.600 
but oh well breaker breaker increases
attack<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.329> defense<00:01:39.329> doesn't<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
attack but defense doesn't is a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
decreased when I real evelope like when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
decreased when I real evelope like when
you<00:01:43.619> level<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.950> you'll<00:01:44.189> increase<00:01:44.579> every

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you level up you'll increase every

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.359 
you level up you'll increase every
single<00:01:45.299> stat<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.750> defense<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
single stat but defense will go up a

single stat but defense will go up a
little<00:01:47.759> less<00:01:48.090> than<00:01:48.479> every<00:01:48.960> other<00:01:48.990> type<00:01:49.700> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
little less than every other type and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
little less than every other type and
next<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.310> Guardian<00:01:53.790> guardian<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.439> exact

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
next is Guardian guardian is the exact

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
next is Guardian guardian is the exact
opposite<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.490> breaker<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.000> defense<00:01:57.450> will

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
opposite and breaker like defense will

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.090 
opposite and breaker like defense will
increase<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.110> attack<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.560> increase<00:01:58.799> less

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
increase an attack will increase less

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.550 
increase an attack will increase less
like<00:02:00.060> my<00:02:00.210> Sofia<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:00.990> has<00:02:01.520> 1396<00:02:02.520> attack<00:02:03.329> in

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
like my Sofia here has 1396 attack in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.370 
like my Sofia here has 1396 attack in
1395<00:02:04.759> defense<00:02:05.759> there's<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.780> breaker<00:02:07.020> she

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
1395 defense there's a breaker she

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
1395 defense there's a breaker she
probably<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.039> eleven<00:02:08.489> hundred<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
probably have about eleven hundred to a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.830 
probably have about eleven hundred to a
thousand<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:10.050> even<00:02:10.319> 1200<00:02:10.860> defense<00:02:11.840> but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
thousand maybe even 1200 defense but

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.470 
thousand maybe even 1200 defense but
should<00:02:13.110> have

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
should have

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.640 
should have
14:52<00:02:15.480> 1,500<00:02:16.409> attack<00:02:16.709> right<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:19.549> and<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:22.140> don't

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
14:52 1,500 attack right now and I don't

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.319 
14:52 1,500 attack right now and I don't
think<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.189> have<00:02:23.280> an<00:02:23.370> Oracle<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.090> hate

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
think I have an Oracle because I hate

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:24.800 
think I have an Oracle because I hate
those

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
those

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.770 
those
but<00:02:25.610> Oracle<00:02:26.610> I'll<00:02:27.329> go<00:02:27.569> back<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.870> Thunder<00:02:28.140> as

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
but Oracle I'll go back to Thunder as

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.520 
but Oracle I'll go back to Thunder as
his<00:02:30.780> re<00:02:31.170> EC<00:02:31.680> would<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.010> higher<00:02:32.280> than<00:02:32.609> as<00:02:32.790> HP<00:02:33.530> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
his re EC would be higher than as HP so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.589 
his re EC would be higher than as HP so
when<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> level<00:02:35.700> them<00:02:35.760> up<00:02:35.909> yeah<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.359> would

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
when you level them up yeah that would

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.259 
when you level them up yeah that would
happen<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.409> our<00:02:37.920> recovery<00:02:38.700> would<00:02:38.849> level<00:02:39.150> up

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
happen is our recovery would level up

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.759 
happen is our recovery would level up
and<00:02:39.390> his<00:02:39.540> HP<00:02:39.959> would<00:02:40.079> go<00:02:40.260> down<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:43.560> can

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
and his HP would go down so it can

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.699 
and his HP would go down so it can
differ<00:02:43.950> greatly<00:02:44.159> like<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:45.629> could<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:46.019> five

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
differ greatly like you could have five

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.460 
differ greatly like you could have five
like<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.849> maxed<00:02:48.209> out<00:02:48.329> completely<00:02:48.989> met<00:02:49.260> five

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like the maxed out completely met five

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.190 
like the maxed out completely met five
or<00:02:49.650> six<00:02:49.859> star<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.190> could<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.480> 500<00:02:51.480> HP

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
or six star you could have 500 HP

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
or six star you could have 500 HP
difference<00:02:52.650> between<00:02:53.930> anima<00:02:54.930> type<00:02:55.220> regular

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
difference between anima type regular

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
difference between anima type regular
types<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.819> then<00:02:57.299> recovery<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.049> animal

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
types and then recovery and animal

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.179 
types and then recovery and animal
recovery<00:02:59.040> versus<00:02:59.879> an<00:03:00.030> Oracle<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.569> mean

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
recovery versus an Oracle one I mean

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.289 
recovery versus an Oracle one I mean
they<00:03:02.189> would<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.459> maybe<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.790> thousand

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
they would have maybe a thousand

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.740 
they would have maybe a thousand
difference<00:03:03.829> sometimes<00:03:05.239> maybe<00:03:06.239> around<00:03:06.450> there

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
difference sometimes maybe around there

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.929 
difference sometimes maybe around there
actually<00:03:07.170> sometimes<00:03:08.159> even<00:03:08.489> more<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:10.939> it

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
actually sometimes even more but it

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.890 
actually sometimes even more but it
depends<00:03:12.480> on<00:03:12.599> care<00:03:13.079> unit<00:03:13.500> 2<00:03:13.590> unit<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.689> like<00:03:15.689> for

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
depends on care unit 2 unit so like for

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.099 
depends on care unit 2 unit so like for
example<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:17.310> unit<00:03:17.699> brand<00:03:18.120> new<00:03:18.239> unit<00:03:18.629> she's

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
example this unit brand new unit she's

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.460 
example this unit brand new unit she's
really<00:03:19.410> good<00:03:19.590> any<00:03:19.889> type<00:03:20.449> if<00:03:21.449> you're<00:03:22.139> unlucky

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
really good any type if you're unlucky

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.530 
really good any type if you're unlucky
in<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.280> getting<00:03:23.430> oracle<00:03:23.879> you<00:03:24.060> could<00:03:24.209> still

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
in you getting oracle you could still

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.530 
in you getting oracle you could still
use<00:03:24.810> her<00:03:25.430> that's<00:03:26.430> what<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.699> really<00:03:27.120> love<00:03:27.329> what

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
use her that's what I really love what

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.949 
use her that's what I really love what
the<00:03:27.660> new<00:03:27.810> units<00:03:28.199> is<00:03:28.379> they<00:03:28.709> do<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.699> and<00:03:30.030> since

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the new units is they do that and since

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.470 
the new units is they do that and since

decrease its balanced out now like the

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.890 
decrease its balanced out now like the
stats<00:03:41.340> won't<00:03:41.609> may<00:03:41.849> not<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.209> balanced<00:03:42.599> like<00:03:42.750> you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
stats won't may not be balanced like you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.659 
stats won't may not be balanced like you
might<00:03:43.049> have<00:03:43.199> less<00:03:43.379> recovery<00:03:43.889> than<00:03:44.069> intact<00:03:44.549> in

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
might have less recovery than intact in

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.819 
might have less recovery than intact in
defense<00:03:44.909> but<00:03:45.030> some<00:03:45.720> units<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.229> is<00:03:46.260> completely

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
defense but some units it is completely

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.770 
defense but some units it is completely
balanced<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.879> lira<00:03:48.569> or<00:03:48.989> farlan<00:03:50.780> they're

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
balanced like lira or farlan they're

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.059 
balanced like lira or farlan they're
just<00:03:52.199> wow<00:03:53.629> well<00:03:54.629> yeah<00:03:54.720> Lord<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.349> no<00:03:55.680> increase

or decrease a lot of people prefer that

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.439 
or decrease a lot of people prefer that
because<00:03:58.549> there<00:03:59.549> isn't<00:03:59.699> a<00:03:59.849> decrease<00:04:00.269> or

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449
