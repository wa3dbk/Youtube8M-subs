00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
compression socks so the way that this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.929 
compression socks so the way that this
works<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.390> maximum<00:02:04.380> compression<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
works is maximum compression and the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.370 
works is maximum compression and the
angle<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> gradually<00:02:07.259> decrease

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
angle that's going to gradually decrease

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
angle that's going to gradually decrease
as<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.489> make<00:02:08.670> your<00:02:08.700> way<00:02:08.849> through<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> calf

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
as you make your way through the calf

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
maybe the the gray on the form so we can

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.430 
maybe the the gray on the form so we can
see<00:02:30.130> compression<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:31.450> show<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:32.020> as<00:02:32.230> well

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
see compression I just show this as well

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.250 
see compression I just show this as well
if<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.310> there's<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.760> rib<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.960> is<00:02:35.110> where

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
if I can there's a rib and this is where

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
if I can there's a rib and this is where
you<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.800> what<00:02:36.040> Nicolette<00:02:36.550> was<00:02:36.670> trying<00:02:36.940> to

you can see what Nicolette was trying to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.900 
you can see what Nicolette was trying to
show<00:02:37.210> us<00:02:37.240> that<00:02:37.560> varied<00:02:38.560> compression<00:02:39.310> starts<00:02:39.820> a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
show us that varied compression starts a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.790 
show us that varied compression starts a
little<00:02:40.060> bit<00:02:40.330> tighter<00:02:40.660> here<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.500> part<00:02:41.740> of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
little bit tighter here and this part of

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.890 
little bit tighter here and this part of
your<00:02:41.890> foot<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.310> there<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.580> can<00:02:42.700> see<00:02:42.900> release

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
your foot and there you can see release

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.470 
your foot and there you can see release
is<00:02:44.140> at<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.500> heel<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.459> not<00:02:45.640> pulling<00:02:46.180> too

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
is at the heel so it's not pulling too

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.690 
is at the heel so it's not pulling too
tight<00:02:46.510> there<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.800> also<00:02:47.980> not<00:02:48.400> going<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
tight there and it's also not going to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.730 
tight there and it's also not going to
cut<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.150> off<00:02:49.180> across<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.110> front<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> foot

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and then it opens up there's just like

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.699 
and then it opens up there's just like
different<00:02:54.010> widths<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> ribbing<00:02:56.320> as<00:02:56.470> it

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
different widths of the ribbing as it

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.280 
different widths of the ribbing as it
gets<00:02:56.890> your<00:02:57.190> calf<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.239> it's<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.750> cutting

already August first so if you want to
tuck<00:05:34.620> them<00:05:34.770> away<00:05:34.949> you<00:05:34.979> can<00:05:35.129> do<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.789> for<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
tuck them away you can do that for the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.719 
tuck them away you can do that for the
holidays<00:05:36.830> twenty<00:05:37.830> one<00:05:37.979> dollars<00:05:38.159> and<00:05:38.490> fifty

this<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.580> varied<00:05:42.060> compression<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.199> can

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
this is varied compression so you can

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.459 
this is varied compression so you can
really<00:05:44.189> see<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.789> think<00:05:44.909> when<00:05:45.270> it's<00:05:45.449> on<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:45.839> form

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
really see I think when it's on the form

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.469 
really see I think when it's on the form
I'm<00:05:47.009> gonna<00:05:47.129> grab<00:05:47.430> this<00:05:47.610> in<00:05:47.819> the<00:05:47.909> gray<00:05:48.149> again

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
I'm gonna grab this in the gray again

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.019 
I'm gonna grab this in the gray again
one<00:05:48.719> more<00:05:48.870> time<00:05:48.930> Nicolette<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:49.979> just<00:05:50.729> show

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
one more time Nicolette and just show

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.659 
one more time Nicolette and just show
that<00:05:51.659> varied<00:05:52.139> compression<00:05:52.860> starting<00:05:53.399> at<00:05:53.520> the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
that varied compression starting at the

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.550 
that varied compression starting at the
toe<00:05:54.439> see<00:05:55.439> how<00:05:55.589> it<00:05:55.770> releases<00:05:56.129> at<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.669> heel<00:05:57.180> and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
toe see how it releases at the heel and

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.800 
toe see how it releases at the heel and
then<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.680> starts<00:05:59.099> to<00:05:59.310> slowly<00:05:59.939> gradually

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
then it starts to slowly gradually

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.469 
then it starts to slowly gradually
release<00:06:01.560> as<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:01.979> goes<00:06:02.159> up<00:06:02.339> the<00:06:02.639> leg<00:06:02.879> so<00:06:03.270> it

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
release as it goes up the leg so it

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.529 
release as it goes up the leg so it
keeps<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.960> energy<00:06:04.560> and<00:06:05.099> the<00:06:05.520> movement<00:06:06.089> going

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
keeps the energy and the movement going

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.619 
keeps the energy and the movement going
this<00:06:06.899> way<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.469> slowly<00:06:08.460> releases<00:06:09.149> as<00:06:09.300> it<00:06:09.479> gets

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
this way and slowly releases as it gets

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.119 
this way and slowly releases as it gets
up<00:06:09.779> to<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:09.960> top<00:06:10.259> so<00:06:10.439> it's<00:06:10.589> not<00:06:10.740> cutting<00:06:10.949> off

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
up to the top so it's not cutting off

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.189 
up to the top so it's not cutting off
she<00:06:11.370> doesn't<00:06:11.610> need<00:06:11.849> more<00:06:12.120> energy<00:06:12.240> nowadays<00:06:12.990> I

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
she doesn't need more energy nowadays I

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.110 
she doesn't need more energy nowadays I
could<00:06:13.379> always<00:06:13.529> use<00:06:13.649> more<00:06:13.979> energy<00:06:14.129> this<00:06:15.060> time

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
could always use more energy this time

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.339 
could always use more energy this time
in<00:06:15.449> the<00:06:15.509> morning<00:06:16.099> that's<00:06:17.099> why<00:06:17.310> we're<00:06:18.349> all
