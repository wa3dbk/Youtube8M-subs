00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.310 

and<00:00:12.070> this<00:00:12.820> is<00:00:12.940> a<00:00:13.059> science<00:00:13.450> experiment<00:00:14.049> that

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
and this is a science experiment that

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.010 
and this is a science experiment that
I'm<00:00:14.469> going<00:00:14.680> to<00:00:14.740> do<00:00:14.920> it's<00:00:15.549> a<00:00:15.700> filter<00:00:16.090> combine

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
I'm going to do it's a filter combine

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.859 
I'm going to do it's a filter combine
with<00:00:17.200> four<00:00:17.470> layers<00:00:17.680> first<00:00:18.490> it's<00:00:19.000> steel<00:00:19.570> wool

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
with four layers first it's steel wool

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.859 
with four layers first it's steel wool
then<00:00:20.290> J<00:00:20.680> cloth<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.820> cotton<00:00:22.090> balls<00:00:22.419> and<00:00:22.720> then<00:00:22.810> a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
then J cloth and cotton balls and then a

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.140 
then J cloth and cotton balls and then a
little<00:00:23.080> sponge<00:00:23.380> there<00:00:23.680> at<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:23.860> bottom<00:00:24.189> now

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
little sponge there at the bottom now

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.019 
little sponge there at the bottom now
we're<00:00:25.689> gonna<00:00:25.810> pour<00:00:26.140> some<00:00:26.580> mixture<00:00:27.580> of<00:00:27.789> this

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
we're gonna pour some mixture of this

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.710 
we're gonna pour some mixture of this
dirt<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.329> water<00:00:28.980> yeah<00:00:29.980> isn't<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:30.460> into<00:00:31.419> here

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
dirt and water yeah isn't it into here

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.280 
dirt and water yeah isn't it into here
and<00:00:31.899> see<00:00:32.169> if<00:00:32.349> our<00:00:32.710> filter<00:00:33.130> works

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and see if our filter works

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910 
and see if our filter works
look<00:00:35.290> slow<00:00:36.180> slow<00:00:37.180> slow

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
look slow slow slow

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.450 
look slow slow slow
spilling<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:44.470> as<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.710> can<00:00:44.830> see<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.220> steel

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
spilling so as you can see the steel

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.120 
spilling so as you can see the steel
wool<00:00:45.610> has<00:00:45.760> caught<00:00:46.000> know<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.330> bigger<00:00:47.130> dirt

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
wool has caught know the bigger dirt

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.470 
wool has caught know the bigger dirt
particles<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:53.250> our<00:00:54.250> water<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.910> now<00:00:55.150> leaking

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
particles and our water is now leaking

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.000 
particles and our water is now leaking
to<00:00:55.810> the<00:00:55.840> bottom<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.380> bottom<00:00:56.860> of<00:00:56.950> the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
to the bottom of the bottom of the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.910 
to the bottom of the bottom of the
cotton

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920
