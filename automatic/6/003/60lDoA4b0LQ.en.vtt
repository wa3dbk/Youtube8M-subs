00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
dug it out there's still a lot of roots

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.009 
dug it out there's still a lot of roots
in<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> ground<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.489> our<00:02:33.209> family<00:02:33.540> deep<00:02:33.750> what's

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
in the ground but our family deep what's

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.680 
in the ground but our family deep what's
there<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.650> I've<00:02:34.769> left<00:02:34.920> those<00:02:35.299> I'd<00:02:36.299> also

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
