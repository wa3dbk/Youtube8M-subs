metal for I've been I've been calling it

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.120 
metal for I've been I've been calling it
spine<00:00:18.750> metal<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:19.859> spine

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
spine metal but I think I like spine

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.380 
spine metal but I think I like spine
metal<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.789> better<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> looks<00:00:21.240> like

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
metal a little bit better it looks like

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.010 
metal a little bit better it looks like
a<00:00:21.420> spine

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
a spine

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.870 
a spine
it<00:00:22.320> looks<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.650> metal<00:00:22.890> spine<00:00:23.310> metal<00:00:23.640> sounds

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it looks like metal spine metal sounds

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.429 
it looks like metal spine metal sounds
better<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.150> spin<00:00:24.510> metal<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
better but spin metal it is but it is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470 
better but spin metal it is but it is
alright<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.279> fellas<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.359> have

been<00:00:27.510> asking<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.320> spin<00:00:28.680> metal<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> what

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
been asking what is spin metal and what

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
been asking what is spin metal and what
exactly<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.279> right<00:00:32.460> well<00:00:32.610> first

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
exactly is it for all right well first

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240 
exactly is it for all right well first
of<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.750> begin<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.350> spin<00:00:34.770> metal<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of all to begin a spin metal is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.650 
of all to begin a spin metal is
basically<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.730> material<00:00:36.300> you're<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> be

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
basically a material you're going to be

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
basically a material you're going to be
able<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> collect<00:00:37.230> within<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> map<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
able to collect within the map now the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
able to collect within the map now the
the<00:00:39.180> only<00:00:39.420> thing<00:00:39.600> with<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> spin<00:00:40.079> metal<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the only thing with the spin metal is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
the only thing with the spin metal is
that<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.129> always<00:00:41.370> spawning<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that it's not always spawning in the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
that it's not always spawning in the
same<00:00:42.570> exact<00:00:43.469> location<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> be

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
same exact location you're going to be

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
same exact location you're going to be
having<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> spawning<00:00:45.660> sometimes<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.320> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
having it spawning sometimes as in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
having it spawning sometimes as in
respond<00:00:46.800> exactly<00:00:47.399> where<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> location<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.510> at

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
respond exactly where the location is at

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
respond exactly where the location is at
or<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:48.840> close<00:00:49.500> proximity<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.430> where<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
or very close proximity to where that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
or very close proximity to where that
location<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> guys<00:00:52.079> have

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
location is at so like if you guys have

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
location is at so like if you guys have
been<00:00:52.379> following<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:53.250> spin<00:00:53.579> metal<00:00:53.850> location

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
been following my spin metal location

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
been following my spin metal location
guard<00:00:54.390> sometimes<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
guard sometimes if it's not at that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
guard sometimes if it's not at that
exact<00:00:56.190> location<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> left<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
exact location look to the left or the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.560 
exact location look to the left or the
right<00:00:57.980> you're<00:00:58.980> most<00:00:59.250> likely<00:00:59.520> find<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> within

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
right you're most likely find it within

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.060 
right you're most likely find it within
that<00:01:00.809> area<00:01:00.989> another<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.800> you're<00:01:01.949> able

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that area another way that you're able

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
that area another way that you're able
to<00:01:02.250> collect<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> spin<00:01:02.879> metal<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.480> you're

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to collect the spin metal is that you're

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.170 
to collect the spin metal is that you're
also<00:01:03.870> able<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> collect<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> once<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> defeat

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
also able to collect it once you defeat

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
also able to collect it once you defeat
an<00:01:06.299> enemy<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.500> spin<00:01:07.740> metal<00:01:08.010> will

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
an enemy the spin metal will

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
an enemy the spin metal will
automatically<00:01:08.700> appear<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.299> show<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.470> what

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
automatically appear or show up so what

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.340 
automatically appear or show up so what
can<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.260> where<00:01:13.260> do

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
there and collect and see what spin

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.679 
there and collect and see what spin
metal<00:01:29.009> does<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.000> able<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.420> do

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
metal does and what it's able to do

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
metal does and what it's able to do
within<00:01:31.409> our<00:01:33.500> destiny<00:01:34.500> pretty<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:34.890> take<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
within our destiny pretty much take a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
within our destiny pretty much take a
jigger<00:01:35.490> alright<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.479> basically<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.470> going

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
jigger alright so basically we're going

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.810 
jigger alright so basically we're going
to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.710> able<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> you're<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.700> able

that you can collect within the map but
since<00:02:48.740> we're<00:02:48.890> talking<00:02:49.010> about<00:02:49.190> spin<00:02:49.610> metal

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
since we're talking about spin metal

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.630 
since we're talking about spin metal
spin<00:02:50.870> metal<00:02:51.170> provides<00:02:51.560> lightweight<00:02:52.190> strength

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
spin metal provides lightweight strength

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.210 
spin metal provides lightweight strength
and<00:02:52.910> everything<00:02:53.660> from<00:02:53.870> personal<00:02:54.170> armor<00:02:54.800> to

and everything from personal armor to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.120 
and everything from personal armor to
JumpShip<00:02:55.810> structured<00:02:56.810> components<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:57.980> this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
JumpShip structured components so this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.800 
JumpShip structured components so this
is<00:02:58.220> what<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.490> pretty<00:02:58.910> much<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.240> going<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.420> be
