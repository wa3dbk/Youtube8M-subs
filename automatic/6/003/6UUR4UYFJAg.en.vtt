00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
the way the packaging is I see a lot of

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.020 
the way the packaging is I see a lot of
collectors<00:02:34.680> keeping<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.519> BOTS<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> if

box hina damages the packaging and if

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.360 
box hina damages the packaging and if
you<00:02:40.200> were<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> try<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> read<00:02:40.950> put<00:02:41.130> them<00:02:41.220> in

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
you were to try to read put them in

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.789 
you were to try to read put them in
there<00:02:41.489> after<00:02:41.670> opening<00:02:42.599> up<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.959> figures<00:02:43.319> they

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
there after opening up the figures they

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.289 
there after opening up the figures they
probably<00:02:44.069> wouldn't<00:02:44.459> stay<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.849> same<00:02:45.060> place

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
probably wouldn't stay in the same place

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.150 
probably wouldn't stay in the same place
the<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.049> they're<00:02:46.230> packaged<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.950> I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the way that they're packaged so I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.059
