00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
can use to blow up the gate but that is

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.470 
can use to blow up the gate but that is
pretty<00:02:35.130> much<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.460> can<00:02:35.610> run<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
pretty much that you can run to the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.020 
pretty much that you can run to the
undercarriage<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.760> 747<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.940> hop<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.170> if

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
undercarriage of the 747 and hop in if

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.730 
undercarriage of the 747 and hop in if
all<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.240> do<00:02:42.420> blow<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.440> think<00:02:43.620> you

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
all you do blow it up then I think you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.650 
all you do blow it up then I think you
