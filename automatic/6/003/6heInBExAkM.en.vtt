00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
gave me pretty much no guidance on time

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
gave me pretty much no guidance on time
they<00:00:52.530> said<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:52.890> expect<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> layers<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.180> take

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
they said they expect the layers to take

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.330 
they said they expect the layers to take
less<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.140> 10<00:00:55.770> seconds<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:58.040> that's<00:00:59.040> pretty

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
less than 10 seconds and that's pretty

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.970 
less than 10 seconds and that's pretty
much<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.879> said<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:01.110> these<00:01:01.470> are<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.710> less

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

I<00:05:22.050> am<00:05:25.740> pretty<00:05:26.740> amazed<00:05:27.100> this<00:05:27.400> printed<00:05:28.170> at<00:05:29.170> all<00:05:29.530> I

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
I am pretty amazed this printed at all I

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:38.810 
I am pretty amazed this printed at all I
guess<00:05:30.520> these<00:05:30.930> fast<00:05:31.930> times<00:05:33.510> are<00:05:34.510> also<00:05:34.810> good<00:05:36.540> for

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
guess these fast times are also good for

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:53.280 
guess these fast times are also good for
Venus<00:05:39.820> creator<00:05:40.210> resin

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.920 

let<00:05:54.290> us<00:05:54.410> take<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.710> look<00:05:54.860> here<00:05:58.570> of<00:05:59.570> what<00:05:59.720> this

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
let us take a look here of what this

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.270 
let us take a look here of what this
looks<00:06:00.290> like<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:03.410> have<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.680> consult<00:06:04.070> the

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
looks like and have to consult the

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.750 
looks like and have to consult the

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.470 

this<00:06:13.760> part<00:06:14.090> seems<00:06:14.420> good

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.420 

and

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.830 

it's<00:06:29.030> quite<00:06:29.450> clear<00:06:29.960> you<00:06:31.390> will<00:06:32.390> have<00:06:32.600> bleed

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
it's quite clear you will have bleed

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.420 
it's quite clear you will have bleed
through<00:06:33.140> issues<00:06:33.470> if<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:33.710> have<00:06:33.860> really<00:06:34.190> fine

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
through issues if you have really fine

of this thing worked out I'm going to

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.530 
of this thing worked out I'm going to
have<00:06:40.070> to<00:06:40.130> clean<00:06:40.430> this<00:06:40.610> print<00:06:40.970> and<00:06:41.180> then<00:06:41.270> take<00:06:41.510> a

have to clean this print and then take a

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.990 
have to clean this print and then take a
couple<00:06:41.840> of<00:06:42.020> pictures<00:06:42.260> on<00:06:42.590> it<00:06:42.770> but<00:06:43.700> I<00:06:43.760> guess<00:06:43.970> you

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
couple of pictures on it but I guess you

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.840 
couple of pictures on it but I guess you
can<00:06:44.390> start<00:06:45.020> with<00:06:45.410> if<00:06:45.770> you're<00:06:46.100> using<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.550> Venus

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850

can start with if you're using the Venus
creator<00:06:47.210> you<00:06:47.330> would<00:06:47.600> start<00:06:47.870> with<00:06:48.140> the

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
creator you would start with the

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.660 
creator you would start with the

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
exposure settings that could o3d used

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:59.050 
exposure settings that could o3d used
for<00:06:53.060> their<00:06:55.690> resolution<00:06:56.690> calibration<00:06:57.290> part<00:06:58.060> so

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
for their resolution calibration part so

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.900 
for their resolution calibration part so
I'm<00:06:59.150> pretty<00:06:59.360> clear<00:06:59.720> with<00:06:59.990> half<00:07:00.910> millimeter

I<00:07:31.360> think<00:07:32.360> I<00:07:32.720> lost<00:07:33.170> a<00:07:33.500> bunch<00:07:33.680> of<00:07:33.830> stuff<00:07:33.890> i<00:07:34.430> mean

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030 
I think I lost a bunch of stuff i mean

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.390 
I think I lost a bunch of stuff i mean
again<00:07:35.120> 93<00:07:36.040> microns<00:07:37.120> but<00:07:38.120> i<00:07:38.800> think<00:07:39.800> i<00:07:40.190> may<00:07:40.370> have

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
again 93 microns but i think i may have

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.940 
again 93 microns but i think i may have
lost<00:07:40.730> a<00:07:40.940> bunch<00:07:41.120> of<00:07:41.240> stuff<00:07:41.530> but<00:07:42.530> anyway<00:07:42.830> i'll

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950 
lost a bunch of stuff but anyway i'll

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:49.930 
lost a bunch of stuff but anyway i'll
take<00:07:43.190> pictures<00:07:43.520> of<00:07:43.550> this<00:07:43.790> and<00:07:46.450> and<00:07:47.450> post<00:07:47.720> them
