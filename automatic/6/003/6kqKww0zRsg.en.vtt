crashing<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> stuff<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> still<00:01:31.500> have

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
crashing all the stuff and we still have

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.710 
crashing all the stuff and we still have
a<00:01:31.619> bit<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> crashing<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.400> anyways<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.360> ak-12

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
a bit of crashing but anyways the ak-12

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.060 
a bit of crashing but anyways the ak-12
just<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> brought<00:01:34.409> back<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.890> bad

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
just kind of brought back some bad

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
just kind of brought back some bad
memories<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.360> I'll<00:01:36.570> tell<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> after<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
memories but I'll tell you after I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
memories but I'll tell you after I
started<00:01:37.619> using<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> adjusted

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
started using it and I kind of adjusted

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
started using it and I kind of adjusted
my<00:01:39.570> play<00:01:39.810> style<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> rate<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> fire<00:01:41.220> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
my play style for the rate of fire of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
my play style for the rate of fire of
this<00:01:41.520> weapon<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.150> started<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> realize

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this weapon I kind of started to realize

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
this weapon I kind of started to realize
this<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.530> actually<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> lot<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.130> effective

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
this was actually a lot more effective

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
this was actually a lot more effective
than<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.149> ever<00:01:45.180> thought<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.570> could<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.259> that

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
than I ever thought it could be and that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
than I ever thought it could be and that
the<00:01:46.649> low<00:01:46.829> rate<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.130> fire<00:01:47.310> by<00:01:47.520> definitely<00:01:47.909> no

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the low rate of fire by definitely no

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
the low rate of fire by definitely no
means<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.840> weapon<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
means that this weapon is going to be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
means that this weapon is going to be
something<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.159> won't<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.610> effective<00:01:51.180> now

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
something that won't be effective now

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.330 
something that won't be effective now
when<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.630> say<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.350> my<00:01:52.470> play<00:01:52.740> style<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
when I say I just as my play style to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740 
when I say I just as my play style to
the<00:01:53.520> rate<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> fire<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> mean<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the rate of fire what I mean is that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.990 
the rate of fire what I mean is that
this<00:01:55.079> weapon<00:01:55.530> has<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.430> low<00:01:56.640> rate<00:01:56.880> of

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
this weapon has a pretty low rate of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.840 
this weapon has a pretty low rate of
fire<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.329> 650<00:01:58.229> rounds<00:01:58.829> per<00:01:59.250> minute<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.700> with

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
fire at 650 rounds per minute so with

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
fire at 650 rounds per minute so with
that<00:02:00.000> rate<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.299> fire<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.020> don't<00:02:01.320> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> be

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that rate of fire you don't want to be

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.319 
that rate of fire you don't want to be
getting<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.009> close<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> personal<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
getting up close and personal and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
getting up close and personal and
getting<00:02:03.899> into<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.259> close<00:02:04.530> quarters

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
getting into really close quarters

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
getting into really close quarters
firefights<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.820> weapon<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.390> found<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
firefights with this weapon I found that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.499 
firefights with this weapon I found that
it<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.290> worked<00:02:07.500> best<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.099> domination<00:02:08.700> just

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
it really worked best in domination just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.600 
it really worked best in domination just
kind<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> sit<00:02:09.989> back<00:02:10.020> defend<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> objectives

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
kind of sit back defend the objectives

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
kind of sit back defend the objectives
and<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.450> kind<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> back

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and just be kind of on the back

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
and just be kind of on the back
lines<00:02:13.829> and<00:02:14.159> just<00:02:14.310> take<00:02:14.459> enemies<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.939> from

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
lines and just take enemies out from

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.270 
lines and just take enemies out from
afar<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:16.109> this<00:02:16.439> weapon<00:02:16.799> has<00:02:16.829> literally

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
afar because this weapon has literally

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.000 
afar because this weapon has literally
no<00:02:18.030> recoil<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.019> begin<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.769> with<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
no recoil to begin with and with the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.670 
no recoil to begin with and with the
compensator<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.180> recoil<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.780> pretty<00:02:22.469> much

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
compensator the recoil is pretty much

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.800 
compensator the recoil is pretty much
not<00:02:23.010> even<00:02:23.459> there<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.909> can<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.120> laser<00:02:24.540> beam

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
not even there you can just laser beam

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.259 
not even there you can just laser beam
guys<00:02:25.019> from<00:02:25.650> across<00:02:25.980> pretty<00:02:26.400> much<00:02:26.549> any<00:02:26.760> map<00:02:27.030> if

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
guys from across pretty much any map if

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.610 
guys from across pretty much any map if
you're<00:02:27.420> playing<00:02:27.540> domination<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.439> maps

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you're playing domination as the maps

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
you're playing domination as the maps
are<00:02:28.829> pretty<00:02:29.099> small<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.849> far<00:02:30.269> as<00:02:30.389> your

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
are pretty small so as far as your

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420 
are pretty small so as far as your
distance<00:02:30.959> goes<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.439> engage<00:02:31.739> enemies<00:02:32.250> if

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
distance goes to engage enemies if

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
distance goes to engage enemies if
you're<00:02:32.879> playing<00:02:33.000> domination<00:02:33.689> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.349> pretty

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you're playing domination you can pretty

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.830 
you're playing domination you can pretty
much<00:02:34.620> engage<00:02:35.069> anybody<00:02:35.639> on<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.329> map<00:02:36.540> just

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
much engage anybody on the map just

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020 
much engage anybody on the map just
because<00:02:37.139> your<00:02:37.409> recoil<00:02:38.159> is<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.760> non-existent

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
because your recoil is just non-existent

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.629 
because your recoil is just non-existent
it<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.870> quite<00:02:40.109> incredible<00:02:40.319> though<00:02:41.159> up<00:02:41.340> close

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
it is quite incredible though up close

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.849 
it is quite incredible though up close
that<00:02:42.000> low<00:02:42.209> rate<00:02:42.389> of<00:02:42.420> fire<00:02:42.719> is<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.469> that

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
that low rate of fire is not that

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.800 
that low rate of fire is not that
competitive<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:44.969> do<00:02:45.180> want<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> avoid

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
competitive so you do want to avoid

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.899 
competitive so you do want to avoid
those<00:02:46.169> situations<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:47.459> one<00:02:47.700> nice<00:02:47.849> thing

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
those situations now one nice thing

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.879 
those situations now one nice thing
about<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.419> weapon<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.139> in<00:02:49.319> burst<00:02:49.650> fire

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
about this weapon is that in burst fire

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.979 
about this weapon is that in burst fire
mode<00:02:49.919> its<00:02:50.430> rate<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:51.030> fire<00:02:51.209> actually<00:02:51.450> goes<00:02:51.750> up

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
mode its rate of fire actually goes up

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.300 
mode its rate of fire actually goes up
from<00:02:52.250> 650<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.849> way<00:02:53.939> to<00:02:54.139> 750<00:02:55.139> and<00:02:55.260> now<00:02:55.349> 750

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
from 650 all the way to 750 and now 750

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.159 
from 650 all the way to 750 and now 750
is<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.730> pretty<00:02:57.120> competitive<00:02:57.510> rate<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.959> fire

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
is a pretty competitive rate of fire

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.559 
is a pretty competitive rate of fire
that<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> same<00:02:58.829> fire<00:02:59.129> rate<00:02:59.310> seen<00:02:59.879> on<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
that is the same fire rate seen on the

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.229 
that is the same fire rate seen on the
m416<00:03:01.439> but<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:01.919> noticed<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.639> wasn't<00:03:03.000> really

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
m416 but I noticed that it wasn't really

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.050 
m416 but I noticed that it wasn't really
ideal<00:03:04.019> using<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.799> setup<00:03:05.159> because<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.819> first

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
ideal using this setup because the first

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.539 
ideal using this setup because the first
shot<00:03:06.269> recoil<00:03:06.299> is<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:07.769> limits<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.340> in

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
shot recoil is really what limits you in

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.149 
shot recoil is really what limits you in
burst<00:03:09.000> fire<00:03:09.269> mode<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:10.109> if<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.439> were<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.829> for

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
burst fire mode so if I were to go for

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.830 
burst fire mode so if I were to go for
burst<00:03:11.370> fire<00:03:11.609> on<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.879> weapon<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.419> would

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
burst fire on this weapon I would

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.330 
burst fire on this weapon I would
probably<00:03:13.290> want<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.829> angled<00:03:14.340> grip

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
probably want to go for the angled grip

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.800 
probably want to go for the angled grip
and<00:03:14.730> said<00:03:14.939> but<00:03:15.150> because<00:03:15.450> i<00:03:15.480> had<00:03:15.719> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and said but because i had the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.589 
and said but because i had the
compensator<00:03:16.409> and<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:17.010> had<00:03:17.189> such<00:03:17.430> low<00:03:17.879> recoil<00:03:18.150> I

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
compensator and I had such low recoil I

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.330 
compensator and I had such low recoil I
just<00:03:19.139> played<00:03:19.319> in<00:03:19.440> full<00:03:19.620> auto<00:03:19.829> because<00:03:20.220> I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
just played in full auto because I

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.460 
just played in full auto because I
believe<00:03:20.549> that's<00:03:20.819> really<00:03:21.120> how<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.840> load<00:03:22.229> up

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
believe that's really how this load up

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.770 
believe that's really how this load up
or<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.250> loadout<00:03:23.549> rather<00:03:23.909> was<00:03:24.419> meant<00:03:24.659> to<00:03:24.750> be

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
or this loadout rather was meant to be

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.930 
or this loadout rather was meant to be
played<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.530> as<00:03:25.650> far<00:03:25.799> as<00:03:25.919> gadgets<00:03:26.400> go<00:03:26.609> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
played now as far as gadgets go and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.640 
played now as far as gadgets go and
secondary<00:03:27.659> with<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.049> flow<00:03:28.229> told<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.530> was

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
secondary with this flow told I was

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.520 
secondary with this flow told I was
using<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.040> MP<00:03:29.430> 443<00:03:30.180> pistol<00:03:30.569> again<00:03:30.659> just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
using the MP 443 pistol again just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.229 
using the MP 443 pistol again just
because<00:03:31.799> that's<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.159> secondary<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.909> favor

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
because that's a secondary that I favor

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.000 
because that's a secondary that I favor
and<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:33.659> been<00:03:33.810> using<00:03:34.199> for<00:03:34.739> quite<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:34.919> few

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and have been using for quite a few

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.099 
and have been using for quite a few
games<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:35.849> as<00:03:35.939> far<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.359> gadgets<00:03:36.780> go<00:03:36.930> we

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
games now and as far the gadgets go we

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.920 
games now and as far the gadgets go we
have<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.470> defibrillators<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:39.389> medic

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
have the defibrillators and the medic

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.719 
have the defibrillators and the medic
bag<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.379> that's<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.650> an<00:03:40.859> extra<00:03:41.189> way<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.699> you

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
bag so that's just an extra way do you

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.189 
bag so that's just an extra way do you
get<00:03:41.879> some<00:03:42.060> points<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:42.509> on<00:03:42.569> domination

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
get some points and on domination

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.569 
get some points and on domination
there's<00:03:43.620> pretty<00:03:43.829> much<00:03:43.889> always<00:03:44.159> people<00:03:44.519> to

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
there's pretty much always people to

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.849 
there's pretty much always people to
revive<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.150> that's<00:03:45.359> another<00:03:45.629> useful<00:03:45.959> factor

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
revive so that's another useful factor

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.009 
revive so that's another useful factor
for<00:03:47.159> being<00:03:47.340> with<00:03:47.579> your<00:03:47.970> team<00:03:48.239> now<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:48.930> you

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
for being with your team now if you

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.330 
for being with your team now if you
weren't<00:03:49.169> aware<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.500> reason<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.829> we<00:03:50.069> have

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
weren't aware the reason that we have

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.580 
weren't aware the reason that we have
the<00:03:50.579> stubby<00:03:51.120> grip<00:03:51.209> coupled<00:03:52.109> with<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
the stubby grip coupled with the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.059 
the stubby grip coupled with the
compensator<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.329> compensator

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
compensator is that the compensator

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.920 
compensator is that the compensator
decreases<00:03:56.069> your<00:03:56.430> horizontal<00:03:56.970> recoil<00:03:57.569> and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
decreases your horizontal recoil and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.869 
decreases your horizontal recoil and
this<00:03:58.079> gun<00:03:58.290> has<00:03:58.319> one<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.250> them<00:03:59.400> know<00:03:59.699> it<00:03:59.849> I

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
this gun has one of them know it I

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.939 
this gun has one of them know it I
pretty<00:04:00.359> sure<00:04:00.479> it<00:04:00.540> has<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.900> lowest<00:04:01.169> horizontal

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
pretty sure it has the lowest horizontal

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.159 
pretty sure it has the lowest horizontal
recoil<00:04:02.099> of<00:04:02.489> all<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.389> assault<00:04:03.720> rifles<00:04:04.049> so

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
recoil of all the assault rifles so

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.960 
recoil of all the assault rifles so
adding<00:04:04.409> a<00:04:04.470> compensator<00:04:05.099> makes<00:04:05.729> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
adding a compensator makes the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.270 
adding a compensator makes the
horizontal<00:04:06.569> drift<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.079> weapon

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
horizontal drift on this weapon

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.979 
horizontal drift on this weapon
non-existent<00:04:08.280> which<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:09.000> super<00:04:09.359> nice<00:04:09.689> but

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
non-existent which is super nice but

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.050 
non-existent which is super nice but
another<00:04:10.259> thing<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.650> compensator<00:04:11.220> does<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.939> it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
another thing the compensator does is it

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.869 
another thing the compensator does is it
decreases<00:04:12.810> your<00:04:13.139> accuracy<00:04:13.769> when<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.639> full

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
decreases your accuracy when in full

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.699 
decreases your accuracy when in full
automatic<00:04:15.449> fire<00:04:15.810> by<00:04:15.989> twenty-five<00:04:16.500> percent

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
automatic fire by twenty-five percent

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.800 
automatic fire by twenty-five percent
and<00:04:17.159> what<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.370> stubby<00:04:17.669> grip<00:04:17.759> does<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.359> it

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and what the stubby grip does is it

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.499 
and what the stubby grip does is it
increases<00:04:19.500> your<00:04:19.680> accuracy<00:04:20.159> by<00:04:20.820> fifteen

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
increases your accuracy by fifteen

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.510 
increases your accuracy by fifteen
percent<00:04:21.900> when<00:04:22.200> in<00:04:22.320> full<00:04:22.529> automatic<00:04:22.889> fire<00:04:23.250> so

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
percent when in full automatic fire so

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.560 
percent when in full automatic fire so
essentially<00:04:23.880> what<00:04:24.060> we're<00:04:24.210> trying<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.450> do

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
essentially what we're trying to do

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.170 
essentially what we're trying to do
there<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.110> compensate<00:04:26.070> exactly<00:04:26.969> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
there is just compensate exactly the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.740 
there is just compensate exactly the
name

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
name

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.030 
name
sade<00:04:27.990> here<00:04:28.140> we're<00:04:28.230> trying<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.440> compensate<00:04:28.740> for

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
sade here we're trying to compensate for

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440 
sade here we're trying to compensate for
the<00:04:29.100> compensator<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.790> think<00:04:30.060> I've<00:04:30.150> said<00:04:30.300> that

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
the compensator I think I've said that

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.180 
the compensator I think I've said that
before<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.590> just<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.800> reasoning

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
before and that is just the reasoning

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.800 
before and that is just the reasoning
behind<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.180> loss<00:04:33.510> of

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
behind that so that that loss of

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.200 
behind that so that that loss of
accuracy<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.620> full<00:04:35.100> automatic<00:04:35.460> fire<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:36.030> not

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
accuracy in full automatic fire is not

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.630 
accuracy in full automatic fire is not
as<00:04:36.450> pronounced<00:04:37.110> when<00:04:37.530> we<00:04:37.710> are<00:04:37.830> using<00:04:38.100> that

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
as pronounced when we are using that

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.480 
as pronounced when we are using that
