we are releasing curse from wherever
he's<00:00:40.950> trapped<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> way<00:00:42.149> we're<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
he's trapped now the way we're going to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
he's trapped now the way we're going to
do<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> complete<00:00:43.410> five<00:00:43.680> nodes

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
do this we have to complete five nodes

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
do this we have to complete five nodes
so<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.030> five<00:00:45.510> steps

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so you can think of that as five steps

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.220 
so you can think of that as five steps
so<00:00:46.620> let's<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.070> started<00:00:47.570> node<00:00:48.570> 1<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> really

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so let's get started node 1 is really

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.750 
so let's get started node 1 is really
easy<00:00:49.379> you're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> left<00:00:50.550> of

easy you're going to go to the left of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.630 
easy you're going to go to the left of
the<00:00:50.969> mp5k<00:00:51.660> window<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> you're<00:00:53.190> gonna<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the mp5k window and you're gonna see a
