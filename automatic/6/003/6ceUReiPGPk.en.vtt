00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.190
 and not how guys with you of course 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.840
 max marmat which is shared with you in 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.450
 once again something new 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.439
 and something awesome interesting on 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.540
 today we have at 41 01 ceratherm 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.790
 formerly known something so 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.020
 Britain but strangely enough developers 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.630
 decided to rebalance him 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.540
 and make by quiet stated that this 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.850
 will be at 3 or 7 or 8 level 90 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.780
 percent of what it will be 9 very 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.470
 eighth level 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.180
 pd new branches of the tower type but no matter how 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.190
 strangely for some reason they thought it was 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 will st britain because purely by 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.300
 aesthetic characteristics of this 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.520
 english tank yesterday ker who 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.060
 was the modernization of the tank Cromwell 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.860
 the times of the 1950s for the tank was 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.500
 developed a new tower in which 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.970
 coping 20 pound guns who don't 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.880
 knows it is eighty eight millimeters 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.009
 with an average penetration of 210 220 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 millimeters as well as hard front 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.150
 body reservation up to 101 millimeters 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.290
 the British army they auditioned thousands 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.820
 56 years after which it was sold out 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.340
 have aesthetic characteristics 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.380
 this st our developers love to do 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.750
 some strange splash and very strange 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.659
 things actually sometimes do like that 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.760
 9 tenths of the levels of the tower at tss just 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.979
 unreal appearance who guys do not 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.600
 watched me on the channel there is already a plot 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.470
 about these machines that is ninth and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.050
 tenth level 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.900
 this very branch and so guys now you 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.080
 tell tdh tdh stock configuration and 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.479
 tth top configuration and so in stock 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.729
 hmmm 1150 units 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.700
 mass we have 30 shake monophonic and 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.530
 dviglo 600 horsepower maximum 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.060
 the speed of this tank is only 50 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.810
 kilometers per hour chassis turning speed 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.140
 from 34 degrees to 36 what can be improved 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.790
 Naturally putting a new chassis 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.119
 booking body 100 10 meters forehead 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.470
 35 millimeters board and 32 unfortunate 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.209
 millimeter our folder 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.159
 booking a tower is also very 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.610
 Belyovskaya Crimea, weak food 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.850
 tower 76 millimeters forehead 35 millimeters 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.060
 board and 32 millimeters 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.540
 ass turret base projectile damage in stock 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.790
 we have 230 millimeters and armor penetration 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.420
 base projectile we have 220 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.770
 millimeters 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.150
 more precisely damage to the boss of this 230 units 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.960
 ska confused our guns 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.030
 naturally also something to him 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.560
 varies depending on the top gun 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.470
 or stock so in my stock 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 rate of fire is 5 and 5 or and almost 6 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.260
 merry in a minute this is information we have 2 and 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.840
 9 seconds and spread over 100 meters 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.120
 039 that can be improved by putting the tower and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.610
 put the top gun with a spread of 0 36 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.770
 millimeters bk we have only twenty 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.990
 five shells guys this is very little i 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.580
 I think that let will give in 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.620
 In general, all these characteristics can 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.750
 change because they don't 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.730
 final it's not even a drain from super 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.740
 test and this is just magic so to speak 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.050
 associative guesses and in general 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.590
 small roasts in our 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.230
 Internet review of the origins of the meme 360 â€‹â€‹meters and 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.860
 so what do we have in top in top 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.140
 1350 units of biomechies are not bad 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.620
 for fun it's basically for the eighth 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.080
 level 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.480
 normally considering that we have a good 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.640
 dynamics is still the same maximum 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.790
 speed of 50 kilometers per hour but this 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.460
 times when dvigle 650 horsepower that 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.580
 says that we have about a ton 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.760
 20 horses that is, with a mass of 30 tons 71 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.960
 noisy forces it is very very good 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.780
 dynamics will not yield to almost 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.390
 not 1st at your level but many even 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.390
 bypass uranium base projectile with us 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.830
 stayed and punch me all the same you 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.500
 talking about something talking about what we have 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.000
 perhaps almost identical bowls were 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.820
 drains in the top again guys 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.990
 characteristics are not yet final in 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.360
 this time the rate of fire we have already 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.000
 almost 8 rounds of fire per minute 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.520
 that we are improving the top gun will have 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.410
 about the same we will check about 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.600
 with the same damage but we will have 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.680
 much faster speed you will become 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.680
 shot speed 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.720
 we now have seats 2 and 3 and this is 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.400
 very good and scatter by 100 meters 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.919
 us 034 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.710
 the bull is now thirty-five shells and 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.230
 Turning speed around 44 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.880
 times per second that is basically here 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.700
 such are the top characteristics 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.490
 This bird guys, I do not know what at all 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.890
 from this wait but most importantly 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.590
 which titan has quite good 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.100
 mobility of almost 20 horsepower on 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.650
 a ton is very good for pc and i'm so 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.150
 I think and excellent weapons plus 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.040
 small size of cromwell 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.450
 but as small ammunition as a whole 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.970
 only 35 shells because but what am I 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.760
 not bad guys in since 2 branches with you 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.090
 it won't be possible anyway 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.500
 calmly claiming to be fun 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.720
 of course some time many thought that 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.310
 it will be a premium tank but guys with 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.830
 such characteristics developers 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.750
 just won't take this car because 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.730
 characteristics with him are slightly imbalanced 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.720
 for by t 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.910
 premium because even if not myself 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.280
 so the jagger tigra jagger just 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.220
 will lose its relevance so we wait 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.740
 This fun in the new branch of the tower patek 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.540
 patek tower type is not finish 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.450
 Thank you guys for watching. 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.530
 likes write your comments regarding 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.720
 this wonderful car all 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.060
 characteristics I will expose in the description 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.670
 You can view and, in general, for themselves 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.660
 understand a good machine or not good at all 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.660
 thanks guys bye
