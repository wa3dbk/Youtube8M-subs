00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.770
 hello and welcome to my new tutorial 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.950
 I think I'll teach you how to do the trick and that graph 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.309
 do you get used to it and then after that it's a trick that follows 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.309
 and we will take the versions 2 it will be expensive something like that 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.880
 it's not a trick that follows 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.269
 that allow to make small lights all around 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.539
 Montreal 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 we will go against 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 so we can see what the little lights so what I read 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.570
 will not go away 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.690
 - right here 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.680
 so 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.300
 we can disable 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 but we tighten especially the same 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.550
 sofia is the one of colors are more funny 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.870
 take a phoenix plate time meaning we do not care anything you want 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920
 a record she was aware that any other position horns horns 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.110
 rather what you want is not important to reach the traders 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 did indeed make you blame task than elsewhere tadjer tpc of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.930
 notables of thunder 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 the lack of listening from his entourage especially that the om 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.460
 click here like that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 then 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160
 bedited arithmetic 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.530
 the whole team 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 in other 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.530
 anne mulcahy 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 three sentry box 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.770
 fake also say earlier 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.770
 it will also be like water is suffering from a flu 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.900
 but when our instructors 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.370
 what wanted to kill me both together without it will not work 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.570
 then you will need a constant of lyon 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 so you're concentrating alien godillots 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 so inherited from them it will be the 15th 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.389
 - 20 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.389
 they were able to award their prizes 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.239
 in any case 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.269
 more mutant whore 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.239
 so you will need 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.739
 a key 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 so far so fast that he will have to be with them all good 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.629
 a key 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.169
 keep the target 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.039
 with some flights 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.239
 and one touch to change target without any other 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.659
 whatever it may be at the beginning he has returned 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.479
 rollier 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.739
 I did not see everything 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.399
 it's a being 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.269
 and with the fold 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.589
 this week to be able to shop 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.289
 then 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:51.459
 the text 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.559
 all the laurels on the team 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.069
 the budget riquiqui on the titles eads 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.839
 and z that said maybe I know it's not pretty to pour water believe 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.229
 after the bac steeve foal been on the flat to activate 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.609
 that you put him super six 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.360
 surely visitor doorman 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 hand the cordova case 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.229
 so now nando can not 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.839
 it will be the peixe 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.509
 to this will be 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.199
 75 ' 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.459
 only 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.259
 to it will be in vain 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.789
 high and it will be at least twenty 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.619
 after to read it here 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.719
 that will pass by the profit will be - 20 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.529
 and the z 175 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.999
 in fact we want cerep signs 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.090
 in an area 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.700
 of bench 20 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.229
 I am what cÃ©cile centimeters of snow 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.009
 two years earlier from the player 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.499
 more than 75 author who matches the size of the Duke of the player who has the size 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.599
 of its balance sheet 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.599
 for the time the paddock so you add the man ranks booths 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.589
 so what we start over first will be the site 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.339
 the second will be the cricr is who 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.339
 this is the third it will be the 16th 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.979
 then 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:12.979
 normally 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.349
 all were connected 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.840
 if it is well policed 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.809
 torres remake that every day 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:22.759
 you say halde 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.759
 here is a feature on the result 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.259
 What is it 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.259
 all this crowd 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.449
 Allawi 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.809
 it is that 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.800
 I think you have not seen it 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 just a little problem is that I'm here is that I did 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.879
 it's actually he just took a goal 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.869
 it is true that at home is that the team chopper 2 however an hour 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:03.159
 effort 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.300
 this is good I mocked 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.300
 now when you can see it, it leaves us a trace 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.529
 like what the place has to go back to see 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.580
 so it works the titles 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.270
 if the future 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930
 three little benguela 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.589
 so we can see it when there was no longer 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.569
 for me as you can see so it works pretty well 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.569
 be it behind the scenes knowing that it 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:52.629
 power 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:53.800
 in addition every turn
