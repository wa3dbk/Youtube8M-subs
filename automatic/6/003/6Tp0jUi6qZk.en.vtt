in there and some fine chunks and the
custard<00:02:34.910> powder<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.420> case<00:02:35.599> you're<00:02:35.780> wondering

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
custard powder in case you're wondering

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.530 
custard powder in case you're wondering
why<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.590> put<00:02:37.010> custard<00:02:37.400> powder<00:02:37.519> in<00:02:37.849> my<00:02:38.299> crumble

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
why I put custard powder in my crumble

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.960 
why I put custard powder in my crumble
is<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.709> my<00:02:39.860> topping<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.430> be<00:02:40.519> lovely

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
is that I like my topping to be lovely

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.270 
is that I like my topping to be lovely
and<00:02:41.150> crispy<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.989> little<00:02:42.230> bit<00:02:42.319> crunchy<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.190> it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
and crispy a little bit crunchy so it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.839 
and crispy a little bit crunchy so it
basically<00:02:43.670> helps<00:02:43.970> get<00:02:44.329> that<00:02:44.480> crunch<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:45.230> on

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
basically helps get that crunch going on

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.350 
basically helps get that crunch going on
now<00:02:46.849> you<00:02:47.299> can<00:02:47.480> pour<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.840> topping<00:02:48.230> over<00:02:49.360> all

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.300 
now you can pour the topping over all
the<00:02:50.599> apples<00:02:51.819> there<00:02:52.819> we<00:02:52.880> go<00:02:54.040> make<00:02:55.040> sure
