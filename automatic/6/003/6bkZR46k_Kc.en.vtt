I<00:00:45.030> love<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.199> lashes<00:00:46.499> and<00:00:47.069> they<00:00:47.550> kinda<00:00:47.940> like

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
I love these lashes and they kinda like

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.989 
I love these lashes and they kinda like
multi-dimensional<00:00:50.249> and<00:00:50.339> the<00:00:50.399> reason<00:00:50.729> I<00:00:50.819> say

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
multi-dimensional and the reason I say

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.149 
multi-dimensional and the reason I say
that<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.359> when<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.929> put<00:00:52.589> them<00:00:52.769> on<00:00:52.920> then

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
that is because when I put them on then

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.729 
that is because when I put them on then
it's<00:00:53.339> not<00:00:53.639> like<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.909> flat<00:00:54.359> lash<00:00:54.749> like<00:00:55.139> hair's

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it's not like a flat lash like hair's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.729 
it's not like a flat lash like hair's
kind<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.519> in<00:00:56.850> different<00:00:57.749> layers<00:00:58.319> I<00:00:58.589> guess

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
kind of go in different layers I guess

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.919 
kind of go in different layers I guess
that's<00:00:58.979> why<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.249> call<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.489> smoky<00:01:00.329> layers

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
that's why they call them smoky layers

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.289 
that's why they call them smoky layers
but<00:01:01.679> these<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:02.129> beautiful<00:01:02.879> these<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.209> my

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.499 
using the new I don't it's not new but

one<00:06:19.690> but<00:06:19.990> I<00:06:20.020> do<00:06:20.110> find<00:06:20.530> that<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:22.630> dark<00:06:22.960> one

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
one but I do find that that the dark one

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.010 
one but I do find that that the dark one
is<00:06:23.289> a<00:06:23.320> bit<00:06:23.590> stronger<00:06:24.130> than<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.120> regular<00:06:25.539> white

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
is a bit stronger than the regular white

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.779 
is a bit stronger than the regular white
color<00:06:26.320> that<00:06:26.500> I<00:06:26.530> use<00:06:26.830> which<00:06:27.100> is<00:06:27.220> okay<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.639> white

color that I use which is okay the white

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.450 
color that I use which is okay the white
when<00:06:27.970> it<00:06:28.060> dries<00:06:28.510> clear<00:06:28.870> but<00:06:29.740> the<00:06:29.860> dark<00:06:30.160> when<00:06:30.370> I

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460
