of previous hitch somebody tapped into
these<00:01:13.770> wires<00:01:14.040> using<00:01:14.430> those<00:01:14.790> stupid<00:01:15.450> clamps

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
these wires using those stupid clamps

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.150 
these wires using those stupid clamps

they<00:01:20.160> like<00:01:20.370> clamp<00:01:21.000> open<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:22.260> when<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.500> close

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
they like clamp open and when they close

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.610 
they like clamp open and when they close
they<00:01:23.070> got<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.910> slots<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.350> little

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.100 
they got like two slots with like little
half<00:01:26.460> razor<00:01:26.790> blades<00:01:27.120> on<00:01:27.330> them<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.660> don't<00:01:27.870> like

half razor blades on them I don't like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.650 
half razor blades on them I don't like
those<00:01:28.790> because<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> take<00:01:30.330> them<00:01:30.510> off

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
those because when you take them off

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.680 
those because when you take them off
it's<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.220> leaves<00:01:32.220> exposed<00:01:32.970> wire<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.480> stuff

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
it's just leaves exposed wire and stuff

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's just leaves exposed wire and stuff
but<00:01:34.380> yeah<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.830> left<00:01:35.040> signal<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
but yeah that's the left signal as you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.370 
but yeah that's the left signal as you
can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.150> green<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.330> yellow<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.080> for

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
can see here green and yellow it's for

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
can see here green and yellow it's for
signal<00:01:42.680> there's<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.040> tapping<00:01:44.280> into<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
signal there's all be tapping into that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.500 
signal there's all be tapping into that
one<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:46.470> he<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:47.310> he<00:01:47.700> tapped<00:01:48.270> into

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
one and what he did is he tapped into

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.410 
one and what he did is he tapped into
this<00:01:48.720> side<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
this side so I might actually do that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.710 
this side so I might actually do that
we've<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.950> straight<00:01:52.950> green<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:54.510> green

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
gonna have to figure out which ones

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.620 
gonna have to figure out which ones
which<00:02:00.900> okay<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:01.950> green<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.610> orange<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.150> marker

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
and green and orange translates to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.890 
and green and orange translates to

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and black is signal green and white is

break<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:18.260> should<00:02:18.379> be<00:02:18.470> pretty<00:02:18.680> easy<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.099> wire

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
break that should be pretty easy to wire

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.339 
break that should be pretty easy to wire
out<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.879> think<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.690> might<00:02:20.840> be<00:02:20.989> one<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> those

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
out I think it might be one of those

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.059 
out I think it might be one of those
days<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.510> did<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.900> cut<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.319> off<00:02:24.440> BC

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
days is what I did when I cut it off BC

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.949 
days is what I did when I cut it off BC
I<00:02:25.099> left<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:26.060> wire<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.569> could<00:02:26.720> tell<00:02:26.870> what

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
I left the wire so I could tell what

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.699 
I left the wire so I could tell what
color<00:02:27.140> was<00:02:27.379> since<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.129> green<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.549> white<00:02:29.709> goes

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
color was since is green and white goes

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.640 
color was since is green and white goes
to<00:02:31.099> stop<00:02:31.989> I've<00:02:32.989> got<00:02:33.519> just<00:02:34.519> straight<00:02:34.910> green

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
to stop I've got just straight green

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.930 
to stop I've got just straight green
which<00:02:36.650> goes<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.099> taillights<00:02:37.640> or<00:02:37.879> marker

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
which goes to taillights or marker

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.880 
which goes to taillights or marker
lights<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.849> got<00:02:41.030> green<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.450> black

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
lights and then we got green and black

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.440 
lights and then we got green and black
which<00:02:42.890> goes<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.459> left<00:02:43.700> turn<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.450> friggin<00:02:46.450> so

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
which goes to left turn so friggin so

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.199 
which goes to left turn so friggin so
what<00:02:47.629> I<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.780> when<00:02:48.079> I'm<00:02:48.230> splicing<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:49.160> wire<00:02:49.790> into

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
what I do when I'm splicing a wire into

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.280 
what I do when I'm splicing a wire into
another<00:02:50.810> wire<00:02:51.079> is<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:52.579> cut<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:53.090> cut<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.140> wire

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
another wire is I cut that cut the wire

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.520 
another wire is I cut that cut the wire
and<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.590> cut<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:54.920> right<00:02:55.069> where<00:02:56.260> whatever<00:02:57.260> these

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
and I cut it right where whatever these

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.130 
and I cut it right where whatever these
are<00:02:57.590> stupid<00:02:58.310> tap<00:02:58.549> things<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.810> what<00:02:59.930> I'm<00:03:00.019> gonna

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
are stupid tap things so what I'm gonna

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.339 
are stupid tap things so what I'm gonna
do<00:03:00.379> is<00:03:00.700> I'll<00:03:01.700> peel<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.239> shielding<00:03:02.690> back<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
do is I'll peel the shielding back to

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.800 
do is I'll peel the shielding back to
cut<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.739> wire<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.069> I'm<00:03:04.190> splicing<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.209> cut

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
cut the wire that I'm splicing in I cut

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.420 
cut the wire that I'm splicing in I cut
it<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.989> little<00:03:06.019> bit<00:03:06.349> longer<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.980> what<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.129> do<00:03:07.220> is

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it a little bit longer and what I do is

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.770 
it a little bit longer and what I do is
I<00:03:07.459> wrap<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.180> end<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> wire<00:03:08.629> around

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
I wrap the one end of the wire around

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.809 
I wrap the one end of the wire around
the<00:03:08.930> bottom<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:10.190> wrap<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.459> other<00:03:10.489> wire

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
the bottom and I wrap the other wire

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.479 
the bottom and I wrap the other wire
around<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.269> top<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:12.500> way<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.799> try<00:03:13.280> not<00:03:13.430> to

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
around the top that way I try not to

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.960 
around the top that way I try not to
lose<00:03:13.730> any<00:03:13.910> length<00:03:14.180> but<00:03:15.130> when<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.160> took<00:03:16.819> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
lose any length but when I took the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.610 
lose any length but when I took the
shilling<00:03:17.359> off<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.660> wire<00:03:17.840> accidentally<00:03:18.410> cut

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
shilling off this wire accidentally cut

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.250 
shilling off this wire accidentally cut
into<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.889> couple<00:03:19.130> wires<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:19.849> they<00:03:20.090> fell<00:03:20.930> off<00:03:21.109> so

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
into a couple wires so they fell off so

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.800 
into a couple wires so they fell off so
had<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.440> cut<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:21.920> little<00:03:22.069> bit<00:03:22.250> shorter<00:03:22.579> but

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
had to cut it a little bit shorter but

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.720 
had to cut it a little bit shorter but
yeah<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.079> now<00:03:24.200> I'll<00:03:24.319> s'alright<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.220> now<00:03:25.519> that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
yeah so now I'll s'alright and now that

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.280 
yeah so now I'll s'alright and now that
it's<00:03:25.849> soldered<00:03:26.299> I'll<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.750> slide<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.139> heat

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
it's soldered I'll just slide the heat

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.370 
it's soldered I'll just slide the heat
shrink<00:03:27.319> up<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.359> she's<00:03:29.359> done<00:03:29.569> all<00:03:30.049> right<00:03:30.230> and

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
shrink up and she's done all right and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.289 
shrink up and she's done all right and
I'm<00:03:30.470> gonna<00:03:30.590> use<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:30.919> ring<00:03:31.459> terminal<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
I'm gonna use a ring terminal for the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.509 
I'm gonna use a ring terminal for the
ground<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:32.930> I'll<00:03:33.260> just<00:03:33.470> add<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.280> an

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
ground and I'll just add it to an

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.830 
ground and I'll just add it to an
existing<00:03:34.609> ground<00:03:35.299> there<00:03:35.859> so<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:38.660> to

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
existing ground there so I like to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.440 
existing ground there so I like to
solder<00:03:39.139> my<00:03:39.380> ground<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:39.919> not<00:03:40.099> well<00:03:40.639> I<00:03:40.910> don't

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
solder my ground or not well I don't

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.360 
solder my ground or not well I don't
know<00:03:41.540> sometimes<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.079> saw<00:03:42.260> her<00:03:42.410> them<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:43.190> I'll

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
know sometimes I saw her them but I'll

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.699 
know sometimes I saw her them but I'll
probably<00:03:43.579> end<00:03:44.030> up<00:03:44.269> I'll<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:45.049> crimp<00:03:45.349> it<00:03:45.530> and

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
probably end up I'll just crimp it and

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.220 
probably end up I'll just crimp it and
then<00:03:45.859> heat<00:03:46.639> shrink<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.690> that's<00:03:47.959> how<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.139> do

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
then heat shrink it and that's how I do

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.320 
then heat shrink it and that's how I do
ring<00:03:48.500> terminus

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.080 

and<00:03:52.080> just<00:03:52.290> jam<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.220> heat<00:03:53.370> shrink<00:03:53.580> up<00:03:53.820> as<00:03:53.970> high

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
and just jam the heat shrink up as high

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.980 
and just jam the heat shrink up as high
as<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.330> could<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.660> it

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
as I could get it

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.500 
as I could get it
what's<00:03:55.320> up<00:03:55.470> stretching<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.420> when<00:03:57.420> you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
what's up stretching it and when you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.450 
what's up stretching it and when you
heat<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.720> up<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.140> shrinks<00:03:58.770> back<00:03:58.950> down<00:03:59.220> and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
heat it up it just shrinks back down and

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.180 
heat it up it just shrinks back down and
that's<00:03:59.580> perfect<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:01.590> got<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.890> run<00:04:02.010> that

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that's perfect I just got to run that

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.990 
that's perfect I just got to run that
right<00:04:03.060> hand<00:04:03.270> signal<00:04:03.750> Yeah<00:04:04.200> right

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
right hand signal Yeah right

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.140 
right hand signal Yeah right
Alex<00:04:06.810> damn<00:04:07.110> dude<00:04:08.870> I'll<00:04:09.870> probably<00:04:11.030> throw<00:04:12.030> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
Alex damn dude I'll probably throw a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.680 
Alex damn dude I'll probably throw a
little<00:04:12.330> bit<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.720> conduit<00:04:13.350> on<00:04:13.530> here<00:04:14.510> just<00:04:15.510> to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
little bit of conduit on here just to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.430 
little bit of conduit on here just to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
at the bottom somewhere I'm not sure

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.540 
at the bottom somewhere I'm not sure
we're<00:04:51.750> there<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.560> know<00:04:52.650> what<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.830> might<00:04:53.010> do<00:04:53.310> I

we're there you know what I might do I

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.110

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
might just like fix this thing and then

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.350 
might just like fix this thing and then
keep<00:04:57.450> it<00:04:57.630> inside<00:04:58.200> here<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.550> then<00:04:59.910> when<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.090> need

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
keep it inside here and then when I need

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
keep it inside here and then when I need
to<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.930> just<00:05:01.410> tried<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.919> I<00:05:02.070> could<00:05:02.900> pop<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.169> down

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
to I just tried this I could pop it down

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.290 
to I just tried this I could pop it down
the<00:05:04.620> bottom<00:05:04.800> through<00:05:05.220> here<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.790> close<00:05:06.060> it

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
the bottom through here and close it

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.400 
the bottom through here and close it
because<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.740> just<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.190> soft<00:05:08.490> gasket<00:05:08.820> that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
because it's just the soft gasket that

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.159 
because it's just the soft gasket that
would<00:05:10.410> close<00:05:10.680> against<00:05:11.040> that<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.940> closed<00:05:12.900> it

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
would close against that and I closed it

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.000 
would close against that and I closed it
and<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.350> didn't<00:05:13.980> even<00:05:14.040> holy<00:05:15.030> frig<00:05:15.600> I<00:05:15.870> closed<00:05:16.740> it

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
and it didn't even holy frig I closed it

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.460 
and it didn't even holy frig I closed it
and<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.340> didn't<00:05:17.669> even<00:05:17.850> kink<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.600> wire<00:05:18.810> nothing

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
and it didn't even kink the wire nothing

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.250 
and it didn't even kink the wire nothing
so<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:20.690> think<00:05:21.690> that's<00:05:21.840> what<00:05:22.020> I'll<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.140> doing

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
so I think that's what I'll be doing

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.810 
so I think that's what I'll be doing

might<00:06:27.960> do<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.140> separate<00:06:28.500> video<00:06:28.650> depending<00:06:29.430> on

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
might do a separate video depending on

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.450 
might do a separate video depending on
how<00:06:29.640> long<00:06:29.850> this<00:06:30.150> main<00:06:30.420> video<00:06:30.690> is<00:06:30.840> but<00:06:31.710> if<00:06:32.130> it's

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
clearance it for higher angles hopefully

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.600 
clearance it for higher angles hopefully
hopefully<00:07:10.380> I<00:07:10.710> can<00:07:10.830> get<00:07:11.040> it<00:07:11.100> done

hopefully I can get it done

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.000 
hopefully I can get it done
this<00:07:12.450> is<00:07:12.630> way<00:07:12.990> more<00:07:13.350> difficult<00:07:13.470> than<00:07:13.860> I

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
this is way more difficult than I

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.280 
this is way more difficult than I
thought<00:07:14.040> it<00:07:14.310> would<00:07:14.400> be<00:07:14.840> what<00:07:15.840> you<00:07:15.900> have<00:07:15.990> to<00:07:16.080> do

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290 
thought it would be what you have to do

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.760 
thought it would be what you have to do
is<00:07:17.510> you<00:07:18.510> have<00:07:18.660> to<00:07:18.810> have<00:07:18.840> something<00:07:19.410> on<00:07:19.560> this

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
is you have to have something on this

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.770 
is you have to have something on this
side<00:07:20.070> and<00:07:21.440> press<00:07:22.440> this<00:07:23.040> side<00:07:23.370> down<00:07:23.700> with<00:07:24.300> this

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
side and press this side down with this

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.600 
side and press this side down with this
piece<00:07:25.350> being<00:07:25.710> supported<00:07:26.220> if<00:07:26.310> you<00:07:26.400> try<00:07:26.550> to

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
piece being supported if you try to

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.400
