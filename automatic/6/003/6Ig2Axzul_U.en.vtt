00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.959
 welcome everyone to my new site 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 what's called what finite jean is a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.880
 site that is entirely dedicated to the 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.450
 snorkeling apache apnea this is my 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.820
 great passion 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.250
 it's been more than thirty years between 30 and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.670
 35 years old that I practice this sport 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.590
 basically in the basin 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.180
 Mediterranean 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.859
 so over the years I've seen at 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.330
 pretty much good material evolution 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.109
 but different fishing techniques 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.880
 are refined or even improved why 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.310
 have made a site on snorkeling 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 snorkeling again you're going to me 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.160
 to say it is when you type at the end of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.690
 account on youtube I realized 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.480
 account when you tap on youtube fishing 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.510
 in apnea we basically see 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.660
 confirmed fisherman videos showing 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.120
 their exploits so that's for sure 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 dreaming it makes you want you want to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
 share this moment with them but by 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 against what we do not know it's all 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.250
 that everything needed to be done to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 get there 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.109
 So that's what I advise you 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.760
 what I propose is in 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.079
 videos 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 I will do especially in a first 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.369
 time to a comparative study of the material 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.670
 to use more after the techniques of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.530
 fishing the behavior of the fish 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.479
 depending on the environment in which you go 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 evolve go the sea ​​basically due 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.840
 according to the topography ie the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.430
 seabed you will meet some 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.290
 totally different fish species 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 so that too is something to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.040
 take into account 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.650
 and then what did I want 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.050
 others and especially here I hope that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 my videos will be will be useful to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.060
 people who want to learn about 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.070
 diving 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.510
 do not forget little things 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.970
 that the marine environment is a medium 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.160
 dangerous we do not put like that the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 feet like that here it is still necessary 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.820
 has adapted we are we are as we say 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.190
 we and guests must respect the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.620
 marine environment and not do you a course 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.220
 of ecology but we are still not 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.560
 in our natural environment that and then 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 last thing 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.650
 here are my different videos at the end of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.759
 warrant sir returned as well as that 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.100
 I will not make videos that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.229
 lasts a very long time of 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 highs and lows up it will be a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.459
 6 minute video will be fast but 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.920
 at least I hope they will 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.980
 to the greatest number of you 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.840
 to have the answers to the questions that 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.060
 arose and ultimately to 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 no one may have answered 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.070
 so I do not allow myself to say that I 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.380
 know everything nor that I'm really 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.320
 the scholar in this area but at least 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.000
 I prefer to bring you material or my 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.010
 little contribution to the building 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.620
 so do not hesitate to subscribe to my 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.910
 chain called what jean phi and 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.590
 See you soon 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 ciao ciao and it's gone
