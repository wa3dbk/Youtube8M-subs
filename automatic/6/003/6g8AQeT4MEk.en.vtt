palettes see they're the same size so

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.139

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
magnetize so I came up with a way to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
magnetize so I came up with a way to
make<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.600> work<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.199> sure<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.500> guys

a dollar ninety-nine they're just little
round<00:01:50.790> magnets<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.540> adhesive<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.320> back

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
round magnets with adhesive on the back

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.080 
round magnets with adhesive on the back
and<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> did<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.869> applied<00:01:55.320> those<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
and so what I did was I applied those on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.730 
and so what I did was I applied those on
the<00:01:57.090> backs<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> hot<00:01:57.869> pots<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.439> applied

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the backs of the hot pots and I applied

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340 
the backs of the hot pots and I applied
it<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.130> above<00:01:59.610> where<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> shade<00:02:00.420> name<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it just above where the shade name is so

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.560 
it just above where the shade name is so
like<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.680> m10<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.759> still<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.299> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
like that's m10 I can still see that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.300 
like that's m10 I can still see that
there<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.950> want<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> go<00:02:05.280> back

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
there so that way if I want to go back

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.330 
there so that way if I want to go back
and<00:02:05.729> refer<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:08.220> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

wanted to you know take these and then
put<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.569> shift<00:02:12.569> them<00:02:12.810> into<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
put them in shift them into the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.309 
put them in shift them into the
palette<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.910> one<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.390> magnetized<00:02:15.140> I

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
palette the one that is magnetized I

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.110 
palette the one that is magnetized I
could<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.560> course<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.459> take<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.910> off

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
something underneath it to kind of pry

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.509 
something underneath it to kind of pry
it<00:02:23.330> off<00:02:23.540> but<00:02:23.810> I'm<00:02:23.900> sure<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> could<00:02:24.349> do<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.709> so

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519
