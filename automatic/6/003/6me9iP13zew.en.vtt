we're<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.379> flowing<00:00:07.649> two<00:00:08.010> hundred

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
we're going to be flowing two hundred

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.580 
we're going to be flowing two hundred
and<00:00:08.550> eighty<00:00:08.880> two<00:00:09.330> hundred<00:00:09.360> sixty-six<00:00:10.110> gallons

and eighty two hundred sixty-six gallons

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.339 
and eighty two hundred sixty-six gallons
a<00:00:10.650> minute<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> first<00:00:12.540> way<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.259> know

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
a minute the first way is what you know

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.950 
a minute the first way is what you know
basically<00:00:13.740> Superman<00:00:14.429> style<00:00:14.820> you're<00:00:15.570> hanging

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
basically Superman style you're hanging

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.250 
basically Superman style you're hanging
on<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.350> dear<00:00:16.410> life<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.480> you're<00:00:18.480> using<00:00:18.660> total

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
on for dear life and you're using total

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.519 
on for dear life and you're using total
arm<00:00:19.590> strength<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> hold<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.789> thing<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.529> what

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
arm strength to hold this thing up what

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.640 
arm strength to hold this thing up what
you'll<00:00:22.710> find<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.390> you<00:00:24.390> can't<00:00:24.980> hold<00:00:25.980> much<00:00:26.550> water

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
you'll find is you can't hold much water

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
you'll find is you can't hold much water
without<00:00:28.650> starting<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.550> fall<00:00:29.789> backwards

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
without starting to fall backwards

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
without starting to fall backwards
you're<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.710> doing<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.640> arm

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you're just doing this all with arm

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.220 
you're just doing this all with arm
strength<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> least<00:00:34.770> efficient<00:00:35.370> way

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
strength this is the least efficient way

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.900 
strength this is the least efficient way
to<00:00:37.230> flow<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> big<00:00:37.950> water<00:00:38.219> line

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to flow a big water line

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.470 
to flow a big water line
hey<00:00:39.210> guys<00:00:39.420> switch<00:00:39.809> over

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.520 

a<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:43.230> smarter<00:00:43.710> way<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:45.320> grab<00:00:46.320> your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
a much smarter way is to grab your

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.070 
a much smarter way is to grab your
straps<00:00:48.020> that<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.200> got

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.230 

put<00:00:52.560> them<00:00:52.650> around<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.950> nozzle<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.150> them

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
put them around the nozzle or I put them

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.150 
put them around the nozzle or I put them
round<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> hose<00:00:54.830> gonna<00:00:55.830> run<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.070> across

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
round the hose gonna run them across

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.870 
round the hose gonna run them across
your<00:00:56.370> back<00:00:57.680> reason<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.130> if<00:00:59.700> you

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
your back reason to do that is if you

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.840 
your back reason to do that is if you
lose<00:01:00.150> this<00:01:00.420> nozzle<00:01:01.010> it'll<00:01:02.010> spin<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.520> away

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
lose this nozzle it'll spin you away

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
lose this nozzle it'll spin you away
from<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.240> nozzle<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.810> you<00:01:03.930> hold<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.380> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
from the nozzle if you hold it to the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.370 
from the nozzle if you hold it to the
back<00:01:04.740> but<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.660> nozzle<00:01:07.050> man<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.230> going<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
back but now the nozzle man is going to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.930 
back but now the nozzle man is going to
make<00:01:07.560> sure<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> he's<00:01:07.980> got<00:01:08.130> lots<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.670> pressure

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
make sure that he's got lots of pressure

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.060 
make sure that he's got lots of pressure
on<00:01:09.150> his<00:01:09.270> strap<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.080> guy<00:01:10.230> behind<00:01:10.560> him<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.830> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
on his strap the guy behind him is going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
on his strap the guy behind him is going
to<00:01:11.160> get<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.550> much<00:01:11.730> pressure<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.210> he<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.480> has

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to get as much pressure as he can has

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
to get as much pressure as he can has
strap<00:01:13.640> go<00:01:14.640> ahead<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:16.080> helps<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.830> guy<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.370> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
bodies are taking the nozzle reaction

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
bodies are taking the nozzle reaction
it's<00:01:26.910> going<00:01:27.680> 266<00:01:28.680> gallons<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> minute<00:01:29.510> two<00:01:30.510> guys

the smartest way go ahead and shut it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
the smartest way go ahead and shut it
down

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
down

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.390 
down
not<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.000> arms<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:41.130> sit

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
not to use your arms at all is the sit

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
not to use your arms at all is the sit
on<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.700> darn<00:01:41.939> thing<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.270> put<00:01:42.659> nozzle

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
on the darn thing and put nozzle

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.460 
on the darn thing and put nozzle
reaction<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.400> ground<00:01:45.259> we're<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
reaction into the ground we're going to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.730 
reaction into the ground we're going to
have<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.830> person<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.580> Flo<00:01:48.049> 266<00:01:49.049> gallons<00:01:49.530> by

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
have one person here Flo 266 gallons by

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.370 
have one person here Flo 266 gallons by
himself<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.149> guy<00:01:51.330> behind<00:01:51.720> them<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.020> help<00:01:52.229> by

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
himself the guy behind them can help by

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
himself the guy behind them can help by
just<00:01:52.590> putting<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.890> foot<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.430> line<00:01:53.580> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just putting this foot on the line to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
just putting this foot on the line to
add<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.330> more<00:01:54.420> friction<00:01:54.810> loss<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
add a little more friction loss but the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190 
add a little more friction loss but the
idea<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> start<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> nozzle<00:01:57.240> point<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.080> up

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
idea is you start the nozzle point it up

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
idea is you start the nozzle point it up
is<00:01:58.380> pretty<00:01:58.979> high<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.580> air<00:01:59.670> until<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.060> get

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
is pretty high in the air until you get

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.260 
is pretty high in the air until you get
comfortable<00:02:00.539> open<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:02.030> right<00:02:03.030> now<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
comfortable open it up right now the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.440 
comfortable open it up right now the
nozzle<00:02:03.780> reaction<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.649> into<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.979> ground

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
nozzle reaction is going into the ground

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.029 
nozzle reaction is going into the ground
and<00:02:06.450> set<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.080> firefighter<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.739> then

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
and set it into the firefighter and then

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.350 
and set it into the firefighter and then
as<00:02:11.190> he<00:02:11.310> feels<00:02:11.489> comfortable<00:02:11.730> he's<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.300> to

as he feels comfortable he's going to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.270 
as he feels comfortable he's going to
lower<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.840> stream<00:02:13.410> down<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.269> effective

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
lower the stream down so it's effective

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.040 
lower the stream down so it's effective
if<00:02:17.280> he<00:02:17.400> starts<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> slide<00:02:18.030> backwards<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.930> he

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
if he starts to slide backwards all he

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.800 
if he starts to slide backwards all he
has<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.200> do<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.739> lift<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.450> most<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.720> you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
has to do is lift it up most of it you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
a nice big loop and tie it up and so it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.960 
a nice big loop and tie it up and so it
makes<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.239> fixed<00:02:27.690> position

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
