00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.160
 interpreted themes as without waking up 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.100

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.900

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.450
 excited help and I enjoy sharing 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.670

 Ecuadorian how he felt at

 acoustics at the end are themes of the new 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 album that we've tested but 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.380
 that always the first times up 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.520
 assemble yes everything and apart the funny ones 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.710
 so that when it 's an audience 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.590
 Little girl is much more nervous because 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.340
 you see the faces to each one also the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.290
 pop band 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.780
 I take the opportunity to comment on your new 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.670
 name disk nothing the truth that 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.070
 we are super happy this record is 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.440
 super different I believe the first and the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.479
 second or almost that people by 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.850
 please do not make any expectation or 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.180
 no one and if it might look like a 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.430
 little I do not know what not because the first 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.890
 well we have always said it is more pope 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.959
 we were just starting with kudai the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.160
 second we put a little bit a 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.300
 much darker wave a little bit 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.210
 little bit from Moscow 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.380
 and this is a much more neutral thing 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.760
 where we wanted more than anything in the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.580
 look more at the power of the sound and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.100
 that sounds awesome besides having 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.350
 the plan to take his music to the USA and 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.600
 europe for two he referred to a great 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.990
 change in the music of Kuwait said 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.490
 goodbye to the synthesizers and much better 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.980
 because he really listens to a sound more 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.240
 true more pure and I feel like they say 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.860
 to be in a synthesizer that 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.900
 will hear the type and hitting the battery 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.360
 I really do not know is really a disc 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.920
 very good in our favorites are 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.030
 very happy that this May 13th leaves like this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.010
 we hope that people listen to it 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.820
 for the universal gustavo television 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.820
