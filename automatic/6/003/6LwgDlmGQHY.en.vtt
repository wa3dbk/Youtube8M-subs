00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.780
 Hi , Iâ€™m not a couch at all 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.120
 and you are only two years old, but he already looks 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.549
 not at all commodity in the house lives 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.280
 little baby and on the couch this is very 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.679
 strongly reflected see he all in 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.790
 divorce but divorce he after vanish 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.970
 at first he was spotted i washed with vanish 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.800
 instead of spots there were divorces and the same 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.610
 padding stretched now she just 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.310
 lies like a rag ie state 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.180
 disgusting and so I decided to just 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.790
 I take off wash and drag I 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.890
 make out sofa into its constituent parts I 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.890
 helped a lot window so it came out 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 faster now well, now you need to remove the upholstery 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.840
 there is absolutely nothing in this 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.300
 you just need to pull out the brackets although you need 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.300
 a lot of time passed 15 minutes I took off everything 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.760
 staples in one of the parts and my joy 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.309
 just had no limit it turned out that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.440
 not really all that it was just 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.370
 brackets that held the inner lining 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:16.220
 and now here is another layer of brackets on 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.000
 the outer upholstery then must one part 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.690
 uncovered 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.720
 it looks like this here at all about all 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.840
 it took about forty minutes left two more parts 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.659
 with the same perimeter upholstery removed 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
 spent a little over three hours in total 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.590
 if splitting completely including the back 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.740
 and armrests I think that you can back 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.290
 to cope now you need to wash all of you 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.670
 erased dried now we need 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.670
 ordinary furniture stapler 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.500
 well everything and bill sofa collected looks like 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 newcomer also just can change 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.689

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.689
