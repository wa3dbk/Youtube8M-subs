today's Wednesday

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.150 
today's Wednesday
so<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:08.010> DIY<00:00:08.730> Wednesday<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.599> today<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.679> wanted

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
so it's DIY Wednesday and today I wanted

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.669 
so it's DIY Wednesday and today I wanted
to<00:00:11.250> quickly<00:00:11.490> walk<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.000> through<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.410> RO

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
to quickly walk you through the RO

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.540 
to quickly walk you through the RO
system<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.759> work<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> 90<00:00:16.350> gallon<00:00:16.770> reef

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
system at work for the 90 gallon reef

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.900 
system at work for the 90 gallon reef
tank<00:00:18.529> first<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.800> we're<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.340> kind<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
tank first of all we're in kind of a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.590 
tank first of all we're in kind of a
little<00:00:21.390> used<00:00:21.960> room<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.210> used<00:00:24.480> for

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
little used room here which is used for

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.700 
little used room here which is used for
makeup<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.650> whatnot<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.480> conveniently

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
makeup and whatnot and conveniently

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.130 
makeup and whatnot and conveniently
there's<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> sink<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.420> that<00:00:30.420> almost<00:00:30.660> no<00:00:31.109> one

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
there's a sink here that almost no one

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.010 
there's a sink here that almost no one
ever<00:00:31.650> uses<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.390> we've<00:00:33.510> done<00:00:33.750> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
ever uses and so what we've done is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.060 
ever uses and so what we've done is
we've<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> cold<00:00:35.489> water<00:00:35.850> line<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
we've got the cold water line here and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.330 
we've got the cold water line here and
what<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.190> did<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.610> attached<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:40.040> tea<00:00:41.040> valve

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
what we did was we attached a tea valve

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.450 
what we did was we attached a tea valve
to<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.450> cold<00:00:42.750> water<00:00:42.989> line<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> shut-off

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
to that cold water line got the shut-off

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.299 
to that cold water line got the shut-off
here<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.539> tea<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> leads<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
here the tea and then that leads up to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
here the tea and then that leads up to
the<00:00:47.640> sink<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.360> still<00:00:48.600> turn<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> cold

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the sink so you can still turn the cold

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.250 
the sink so you can still turn the cold
water<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.910> but<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> retrofit<00:00:51.960> allows

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
water on but what this retrofit allows

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.529 
water on but what this retrofit allows
you<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.940> tee<00:00:54.239> off<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:55.250> 1/4<00:00:56.250> inch

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
you to do is tee off your 1/4 inch

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.950 
you to do is tee off your 1/4 inch
direct<00:00:57.539> line<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.940> your<00:00:59.940> three<00:01:00.239> stage<00:01:00.480> carbon

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
direct line to your three stage carbon

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.380 
direct line to your three stage carbon
filter<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> we've<00:01:02.160> got<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> mounted<00:01:03.030> here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
filter and we've got that mounted here

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
filter and we've got that mounted here
on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.140> side<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> cabinet<00:01:04.979> underneath

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
on the side of the cabinet underneath

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.950 
on the side of the cabinet underneath
the<00:01:05.640> sink<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.140> essentially<00:01:07.140> what<00:01:07.380> happens<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
the sink and essentially what happens is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.179 
the sink and essentially what happens is
we<00:01:09.960> stop<00:01:10.590> first<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:13.040> quick-connect

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
we stop first here at a quick-connect

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.149 
we stop first here at a quick-connect
and<00:01:15.080> that's<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> allow<00:01:16.560> us<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.890> shut<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and that's going to allow us to shut the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.260 
and that's going to allow us to shut the
water<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:20.270> then

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
water off when it's not in use and then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
water off when it's not in use and then
what<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.110> through<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.830> first

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
what we do is we go through the first

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.100 
what we do is we go through the first
stage<00:01:23.310> which<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.909> sediment<00:01:24.540> filter<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
stage which is a sediment filter and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.880 
stage which is a sediment filter and
then<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.130> two<00:01:26.340> carbon<00:01:26.790> block<00:01:27.030> filters

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
then we have two carbon block filters

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.030 
then we have two carbon block filters
and<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.130> top<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.640> an<00:01:29.759> RO<00:01:29.970> filter<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
and then up top we have an RO filter and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.440 
and then up top we have an RO filter and
we<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> made<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> these<00:01:33.119> into<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we could have made one of these into a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
we could have made one of these into a
DI<00:01:33.689> chamber<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.070> decided<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> add<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.060> on

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
DI chamber but we decided to add that on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.440 
DI chamber but we decided to add that on
at<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> later<00:01:36.720> date<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> five

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
at a later date so it will be a five

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
at a later date so it will be a five
stage<00:01:39.780> filter<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.380> some<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.520> right

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
stage filter at some point but for right

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.719 
stage filter at some point but for right
now<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> working<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.740> fine<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.700> just

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
now it's working out just fine for just

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.109 
now it's working out just fine for just
fish<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.350> currently<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:47.119> but

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
fish which is what we currently have but

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.719 
fish which is what we currently have but
that<00:01:48.270> fifth<00:01:48.630> stage<00:01:48.899> di<00:01:49.560> filter<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.280> added

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
that fifth stage di filter will be added

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.960 
that fifth stage di filter will be added
separately<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.829> happens<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.520> once<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
separately and what happens is once that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.840 
separately and what happens is once that
water<00:01:54.180> travels<00:01:54.750> through<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.079> four<00:01:55.350> stages<00:01:55.850> we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
water travels through all four stages we

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.510 
water travels through all four stages we
have<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.299> outputs<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.530> into<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> sink<00:01:59.280> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
have two outputs here into the sink is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
have two outputs here into the sink is
our<00:02:00.420> waste<00:02:00.659> water<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:02.509> then<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.930> into<00:02:04.320> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
our waste water and then here into this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.700 
our waste water and then here into this
55-gallon<00:02:05.219> barrel<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.920> our<00:02:07.920> RO<00:02:08.190> water

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
55-gallon barrel is our RO water

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.360 
55-gallon barrel is our RO water
and<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:11.570> can<00:02:11.780> see<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.500> here<00:02:12.740> it's<00:02:12.920> dripping

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and you can see it in here it's dripping

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.180 
and you can see it in here it's dripping
there<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:14.870> very<00:02:14.930> slow<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.010> about

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
there it's very slow I think it's about

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.770 
there it's very slow I think it's about
sixty<00:02:16.670> gallons<00:02:18.760> per<00:02:19.760> day<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:22.280> takes<00:02:22.550> us<00:02:22.790> you

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
sixty gallons per day so it takes us you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.560 
sixty gallons per day so it takes us you
know<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.200> better<00:02:24.410> part<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.860> workday<00:02:25.130> to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
know the better part of a workday to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.780 
know the better part of a workday to
completely<00:02:26.570> fill<00:02:26.870> out<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.200> barrel<00:02:27.790> maybe

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
completely fill out this barrel maybe

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.390 
completely fill out this barrel maybe
two<00:02:29.060> days<00:02:29.240> if<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.660> want<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.170> max<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.920> out<00:02:31.040> but

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
two days if we want it to max it out but

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.450 
two days if we want it to max it out but
I've<00:02:32.210> left<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.690> running<00:02:33.140> for<00:02:33.530> about<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.160> day

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
I've left this running for about a day

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.140 
I've left this running for about a day
and<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.420> half<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.580> it's<00:02:37.580> probably<00:02:37.940> got<00:02:38.060> about

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
and a half and it's probably got about

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.970 
and a half and it's probably got about
35<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:40.280> 40<00:02:40.310> gallons<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.060> water<00:02:41.240> ative<00:02:41.600> and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
35 to 40 gallons of water ative and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.500 
35 to 40 gallons of water ative and
essentially<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.130> we<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.430> here<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
essentially what we have here is a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.100 
essentially what we have here is a
55-gallon<00:02:45.110> food<00:02:45.770> Durham<00:02:46.130> barrel<00:02:46.550> as<00:02:47.110> our

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
55-gallon food Durham barrel as our

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.080 
55-gallon food Durham barrel as our
container<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.890> then<00:02:49.220> we've<00:02:49.460> just<00:02:49.490> got<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.970> on

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
container and then we've just got it on

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.290 
container and then we've just got it on
a<00:02:50.120> little<00:02:50.360> furniture<00:02:51.310> dolly<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:52.730> wheels<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
a little furniture dolly with wheels and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.610 
a little furniture dolly with wheels and
we<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.110> got<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.290> tension<00:02:54.640> strap<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.930> so

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
we just got a tension strap on that so

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.870 
we just got a tension strap on that so
that<00:02:57.770> we<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:57.920> wheel<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.490> whole<00:02:58.670> thing

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
that we can wheel this whole thing

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.840 
that we can wheel this whole thing
around<00:02:59.240> when<00:02:59.780> we<00:02:59.930> need<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:01.430> code<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.820> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
around when we need to to code to a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.810 
around when we need to to code to a
water<00:03:02.150> change<00:03:03.040> but<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.310> leave<00:03:04.490> it<00:03:04.640> out

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
water change but we can leave it out

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.010 
water change but we can leave it out
here<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:06.380> fill<00:03:06.620> up<00:03:06.800> when<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.460> need<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.900> only

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
here to fill up when we need it the only

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.930 
here to fill up when we need it the only
other<00:03:09.290> thing<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> tarp<00:03:10.490> kind<00:03:10.850> of

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
other thing is we have a tarp kind of

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.230 
other thing is we have a tarp kind of
over<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.690> top<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:12.170> make<00:03:12.290> sure<00:03:12.350> that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
over the top to make sure that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.390 
over the top to make sure that
particulate<00:03:14.240> matter<00:03:14.510> doesn't<00:03:15.500> fall<00:03:15.890> into<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
particulate matter doesn't fall into the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.080 
particulate matter doesn't fall into the
RO<00:03:16.640> water<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:18.500> fairly<00:03:18.980> pure<00:03:19.430> water<00:03:19.760> I

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
RO water and it's fairly pure water I

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.450 
RO water and it's fairly pure water I
mean<00:03:20.600> there<00:03:20.990> is<00:03:21.140> some<00:03:21.440> stuff<00:03:21.740> in<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
mean there is some stuff in it that the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.850 
mean there is some stuff in it that the
DI<00:03:22.670> cartridge<00:03:23.420> would<00:03:23.600> probably<00:03:24.110> take<00:03:24.320> out<00:03:24.500> but

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
DI cartridge would probably take out but

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.310 
DI cartridge would probably take out but
for<00:03:25.610> us<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:26.180> right<00:03:26.300> now<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.810> working<00:03:26.990> out

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
for us for right now it's working out

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.370 
for us for right now it's working out
fine<00:03:27.710> but<00:03:28.370> anyways<00:03:28.790> guys<00:03:29.030> that's<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.020> basic

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
fine but anyways guys that's the basic

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.710 
fine but anyways guys that's the basic
setup<00:03:30.590> that's<00:03:31.040> what<00:03:31.220> we're<00:03:31.340> doing<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:32.570> do<00:03:32.690> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
setup that's what we're doing to do a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.300 
setup that's what we're doing to do a
water<00:03:33.020> change<00:03:33.140> essentially<00:03:33.950> what<00:03:34.070> we<00:03:34.160> do<00:03:34.280> is

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
water change essentially what we do is

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.970 
water change essentially what we do is
weíll<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.850> out<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.330> tank<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.870> our<00:03:36.680> salt

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
weíll this out to the tank and our salt

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.370 
weíll this out to the tank and our salt
mix<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.550> do<00:03:38.330> our<00:03:38.450> water<00:03:38.690> change<00:03:38.960> from<00:03:39.170> there

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
mix and do our water change from there

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.920 
mix and do our water change from there
hope<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.340> enjoy<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.450> I'll<00:03:41.660> see<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.840> guys
