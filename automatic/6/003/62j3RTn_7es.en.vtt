very<00:00:12.870> low<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.889> opponent<00:00:14.429> will<00:00:14.580> then<00:00:14.759> loop<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
very low my opponent will then loop it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
very low my opponent will then loop it
back<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> loop<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.350> often<00:00:16.890> very<00:00:17.010> slow<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
back but the loop is often very slow and
