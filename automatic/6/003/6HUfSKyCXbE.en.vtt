it'll be ready to pour into the machine

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.219 
it'll be ready to pour into the machine
then<00:01:25.040> I'm<00:01:25.189> going<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.460> measure<00:01:25.640> out<00:01:25.850> my<00:01:26.229> cherry

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
then I'm going to measure out my cherry

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.800 
then I'm going to measure out my cherry
flavor<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.490> will<00:01:29.360> get<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.570> whole

I<00:02:22.200> could<00:02:22.709> peel<00:02:22.980> bananas<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.700> Holt<00:02:23.909> throw<00:02:24.510> the

I could peel bananas and Holt throw the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.920 
I could peel bananas and Holt throw the
whole<00:02:24.900> banana<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:26.370> into<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> machine<00:02:27.090> you

whole banana right into the machine you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
whole banana right into the machine you
can't<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.409> that<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:28.799> any<00:02:29.010> other<00:02:29.099> machine

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
can't do that with any other machine

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.589 
can't do that with any other machine
because<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:29.909> don't<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.390> large

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
because they don't have the large

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.930 
because they don't have the large
openings<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.319> do<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.769> they're<00:02:32.519> barrel

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
openings that we do and they're barrel

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.910 
openings that we do and they're barrel
isn't<00:02:33.329> strong<00:02:33.690> enough<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.019> take<00:02:34.409> to<00:02:34.769> its

isn't strong enough to take to its

119<00:03:26.010> rpms<00:03:26.639> I'm<00:03:27.269> going<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.540> take<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.959> all<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
119 rpms I'm going to take this all the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.839 
119 rpms I'm going to take this all the
way<00:03:28.410> up<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:29.190> full<00:03:29.430> speed<00:03:29.849> because<00:03:31.549> air<00:03:32.549> is

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
way up to full speed because air is

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.819 
way up to full speed because air is
really<00:03:33.060> not<00:03:33.299> much<00:03:33.449> of<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.690> factor<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.379> Italian

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.559 
really not much of a factor in Italian
ice<00:03:34.949> so<00:03:35.190> now<00:03:35.340> I'm<00:03:35.459> running<00:03:35.699> at<00:03:35.790> full<00:03:35.970> speed<00:03:36.269> I

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
ice so now I'm running at full speed I

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.140 
ice so now I'm running at full speed I
turn<00:03:37.319> on<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.650> refrigeration

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
turn on the refrigeration

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.360 
turn on the refrigeration
I<00:03:39.239> don't<00:03:39.959> put<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> timer<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.040> machine

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
I don't put a timer on the machine

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.270 
I don't put a timer on the machine
because<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.510> timer<00:03:42.780> breaks<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.829> would<00:03:44.069> take

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
because if a timer breaks it would take

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.589 
because if a timer breaks it would take
down<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.670> whole<00:03:44.790> machine<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:45.480> you'd

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
down the whole machine and then you'd

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.259 
down the whole machine and then you'd
have<00:03:45.689> to<00:03:45.750> pay<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.260> an<00:03:46.349> expensive<00:03:46.439> timer<00:03:47.269> as

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
have to pay for an expensive timer as

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.149 
have to pay for an expensive timer as
well<00:03:48.540> as<00:03:48.659> a<00:03:48.689> repair<00:03:49.049> call<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.920> have

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
well as a repair call so I just have

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.360

this<00:03:50.790> very<00:03:51.140> inexpensive<00:03:52.140> little<00:03:52.470> timer<00:03:52.739> I'm

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
this very inexpensive little timer I'm

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.270 
this very inexpensive little timer I'm
going<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.700> set<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.060> for<00:03:54.390> about<00:03:55.310> 17<00:03:56.310> minutes<00:03:56.579> and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280
