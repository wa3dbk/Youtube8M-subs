00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 well last night did you finish 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:37.379
 pit took all the work if clean 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:45.449
 count three days like that now she 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:48.210
 looks all dug taken out and everything 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.449
 looks so pretty pretty 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.479
 well here he was the podium under the tank 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.339
 as I said here there will be a place under 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.400
 support 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.500
 because shed more than 4 meters and 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.900
 even I-beams channel 16 will 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.630
 sag so have to be here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.170
 put the rack 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.180
 here left the grooves there the earth and 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.430
 when everything is mounted with all this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.630
 will end here 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.210
 equipment installation all basement would 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 end here i'm going to sleep 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:32.219
 this place is half rubble 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.770
 type of drainage just in case I do not know 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.439
 there will be no groundwater like that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.929
 here before the valley must have dense layers 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.130
 be earth 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:47.670
 there is no water but who knows how it will be 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.020
 future and here this is deepening if that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.229
 will allow to use the pump for pumping 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.389
 water here and to moisture aiming 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.700
 I was going exactly there I left the earth 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:03.119
 here I will try to make a small bias 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.819
 in this direction now means that it is necessary 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:12.569
 make now need to do the formwork 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:16.280
 I think to fill somewhere in three calls yet 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.650
 it will be difficult to make one visit 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.500
 92 too high altitude side walls 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.020
 large more than 4 meters on one side 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.780
 with this 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.659
 it will be inconvenient to flood 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.489
 this concrete is better to do a few 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.180
 of visits 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:40.880
 but first you need to install 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.880
 sound clues tie all the fittings 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:52.710
 make a reinforcement cage and then you have to 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:59.400
 will set the formwork so 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:02.220
 Now I will go to search for materials on 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.760
 the purchase of materials must look for metal 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.530
 it's time to search 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.630
 rebar wood and bring it all the same 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.140
 I'll have to carry the pipe 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.740
 thought thought thought thought she would have her 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.910
 endure because if here like this 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.910
 stenochka flood 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.490
 15 centimeters as I planned something up 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.110
 pipe I is 40 centimeters 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.210
 given that there still needs to be 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.270
 the ladder will climb very 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.920
 problematic therefore have 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.640
 transfer this pipe cut off set 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.160
 put it here under the slope also under 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.530
 the gate is likely even in this 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.980
 sandwiches I'll put her to her here 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.850
 still the street was near this mountain 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.130
 heat insulation so as not to grab the pipe 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.470
 winter or something else I do not know well, 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:06.950
 in short, he decided so this is all too 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:11.610
 here in my house this here from here goes 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.030
 on the washbasin garage on the horns and well there 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.620
 under the rag counter covered all this is necessary 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.040
 will also remount to take this 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.790
 I still have an air pipe 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.590
 Master's and Aerial 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.250
 most likely try a compressor 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.960
 lower here too in the pit and power all 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.090
 its system which 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.310
 even eat from the water here used to be 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.889
 the compressor here was the compressor hose 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.610
 Now I will try to lower it all down. 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:51.270
 let him stand down there in general everything 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.880
 only still wanted to show this one 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.190
 corner and left first there were doubts 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.280
 breaking it does not break and make a hole 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.419
 even after they started breaking this 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.270
 this well is old I came to the conclusion 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.310
 what let him stand he stood unknown 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.880
 how old and as many as 10 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:15.449
 not more 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:18.979
 why will the guys explain the codes broke this 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:22.039
 the corner of my make that I showed 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.669
 they almost beat us here because 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.930
 such concrete 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:31.830
 I have not seen when compared with a puff 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:38.009
 with an ordinary mine look what 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:41.669
 color it dark blue color in a 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:45.780
 impression that i don't know most likely 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.389
 used shaft stem cement 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.570
 which used to be used in the mine 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.330
 It is not currently used or not 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:59.370
 have this cement 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.590
 equated from brand 900 very durable 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.599
 very durable was hard to fuck 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:10.940
 wished mother had as many sparks flew 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.940
 decay peak on radar 1 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:18.840
 that is, very high quality cement 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.820
 used very very strong even 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.009
 here was a wall that sledgehammer 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.340
 tried to break 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:30.320
 she she just did not have to break herself 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:33.690
 all to break the pieces even beat Street 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.500
 it was just unreal something like this 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:41.570
 big punch smashed 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.570
 like this, the old days did 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.199
 used material now husband too 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.080
 of course there is one but mostly now 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.620
 see shit everything here I poured 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.550
 modern cement in proportion all 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:59.789
 matched a python fenya crumbles 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.550
 you rush about doing so 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:07.010
 screed deck here it was possible in on 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.010
 ice skating skate like on marble floor 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:20.029
 Well, in general, so all nominated for a search 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:20.029
 materials for work bye
