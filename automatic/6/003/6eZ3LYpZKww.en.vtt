this is the next block to come in but
it's<00:00:35.700> always<00:00:35.910> good<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> check<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it's always good to check see the

it's always good to check see the
condition<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> fruit<00:00:37.969> see<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.090> might

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
condition of the fruit see if we might

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.819 
condition of the fruit see if we might
want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> combine<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.140> part<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> block

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
want to combine this part of the block

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
want to combine this part of the block
with<00:00:41.100> another<00:00:41.370> part<00:00:41.700> based<00:00:42.090> again<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
with another part based again on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
with another part based again on the
condition<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> fruit<00:00:43.469> sometimes<00:00:44.399> what

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
condition of the fruit sometimes what

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.279 
condition of the fruit sometimes what
we'll<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> combine<00:00:45.149> an<00:00:45.690> area<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.020> might

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
we'll do is combine an area that might

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
we'll do is combine an area that might
be<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.920> more<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.460> more

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
be a little bit more a little more

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.020 
be a little bit more a little more
mature<00:00:48.629> maybe<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.530> more

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
mature maybe a little more

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.060 
mature maybe a little more
weather-beaten<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
weather-beaten you know we have a if you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.060 
weather-beaten you know we have a if you
can<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.579> we've<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> cluster

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
can see this we've got a cluster

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.580 
can see this we've got a cluster
Cabernet<00:00:56.070> that's<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> few<00:00:57.260> wrinkles<00:00:58.260> on

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Cabernet that's got a few wrinkles on

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.450 
Cabernet that's got a few wrinkles on
one<00:00:58.800> side<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> little<00:01:00.059> sun<00:01:00.239> exposure<00:01:00.629> will

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
one side of it little sun exposure will

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
one side of it little sun exposure will
very<00:01:02.460> likely<00:01:02.489> take<00:01:03.320> one<00:01:04.320> part<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
very likely take one part of the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.170 
very likely take one part of the
vineyard<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.430> combine<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> with

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
vineyard here then combine it with

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.570 
vineyard here then combine it with
another<00:01:06.510> part<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.869> has<00:01:07.130> got<00:01:08.130> maybe<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> little

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
another part that has got maybe a little

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
another part that has got maybe a little
bit<00:01:08.760> less<00:01:08.939> sun<00:01:09.150> exposure<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.590> those

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
bit less sun exposure but that's those

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.380 
bit less sun exposure but that's those
are<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> minor

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
are pretty much some of the minor

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
are pretty much some of the minor
decisions<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:13.770> when

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
decisions that we make when we're when

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.440 
decisions that we make when we're when
we're<00:01:14.909> deciding<00:01:15.830> how<00:01:16.830> we're<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.390> put<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
we're deciding how we're going to put a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630 
we're deciding how we're going to put a
lot<00:01:18.659> together<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.860> essentially<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.490> we

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lot together but essentially what we

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
lot together but essentially what we
what<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> keep<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> block<00:01:22.380> all

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
what we will do is keep this block all

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.160 
what we will do is keep this block all
together<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.580> is

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
together because as as we like to do is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.819 
together because as as we like to do is
harvest<00:01:28.170> each<00:01:28.320> part<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> vineyard

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
harvest each part of the vineyard

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
harvest each part of the vineyard
separately<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.030> their<00:01:30.240> own

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
separately and they do have their own

little their own little micro climates

which<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.520> assigned<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.000> number<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869

which is just assigned a number of the
hybrid<00:01:55.020> style<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.860> clone<00:01:56.310> 337<00:01:57.439> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
hybrid style it's clone 337 and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
hybrid style it's clone 337 and
ultimately<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:59.250> end<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.460> combining<00:01:59.670> those<00:02:00.060> two

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
ultimately we end up combining those two

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
ultimately we end up combining those two
for<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.079> final<00:02:01.409> blend<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
for the final blend but we do like to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
for the final blend but we do like to
harvest<00:02:03.329> those<00:02:03.450> separately<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.170> both<00:02:04.350> have

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
harvest those separately they both have

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.580 
harvest those separately they both have
their<00:02:04.740> own<00:02:04.909> rate<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.090> maturity<00:02:06.689> as<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.530> as

moving along that much more quickly so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.920 
moving along that much more quickly so
we're<00:02:49.950> seeing<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.760> starting<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.600> speed

we're seeing a little starting to speed

we're seeing a little starting to speed
up<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.200> little<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.120> rate<00:02:54.270> of

up a little in the in the rate of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.150 
up a little in the in the rate of
ripening<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.200> see<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> binds<00:02:55.890> are

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
ripening you can see that the binds are

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.890 
ripening you can see that the binds are
they're<00:02:56.610> holding<00:02:56.940> up<00:02:57.060> well<00:02:57.239> all<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> leaves

they're holding up well all the leaves

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.210 
they're holding up well all the leaves
are<00:02:58.140> still<00:02:58.320> green<00:02:58.380> there's<00:02:58.830> not<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> lot<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
are still green there's not a lot of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.440 
are still green there's not a lot of
yellowing<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.690> start<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.020> see<00:03:01.350> some

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
yellowing but you do start to see some

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.710 
yellowing but you do start to see some
areas<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.600> stress<00:03:04.260> yellow<00:03:04.830> leaves<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.400> such

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
areas of stress yellow leaves like such

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.880 
areas of stress yellow leaves like such
as<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.840> pointed<00:03:07.110> out<00:03:07.200> earlier<00:03:07.260> there's<00:03:07.739> some

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
as I pointed out earlier there's some

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.930 
as I pointed out earlier there's some
shriveled<00:03:08.280> fruit<00:03:08.959> one<00:03:09.959> thing<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.500> note

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
shriveled fruit one thing is of note

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.280 
shriveled fruit one thing is of note
it's<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> orientation<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.810> vineyard<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
it's the orientation of the vineyard and

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.530 
it's the orientation of the vineyard and
that's<00:03:13.410> always<00:03:13.590> something<00:03:14.450> important<00:03:15.450> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
that's always something important to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.080 
that's always something important to
understand<00:03:16.370> both<00:03:17.370> from<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.640> farming

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
understand both from the farming

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.720 
understand both from the farming
standpoint<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.840> someone<00:03:19.140> who's<00:03:19.730> interested

standpoint and someone who's interested

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.390 
standpoint and someone who's interested
in<00:03:21.090> how<00:03:21.269> how<00:03:22.080> some<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.560> different<00:03:23.040> aspects

in how how some of the different aspects

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.380 
in how how some of the different aspects

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
to be exposed to afternoon Sun if we

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.379 
to be exposed to afternoon Sun if we
were<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.260> orient<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.250> vineyard<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:23.240> other

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
were to orient the vineyard the other

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.870 
were to orient the vineyard the other
way<00:05:23.600> let's<00:05:24.500> just<00:05:24.590> say<00:05:24.830> I'm<00:05:25.130> facing<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.699> Sun

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
way let's just say I'm facing the Sun

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.460 
way let's just say I'm facing the Sun
right<00:05:26.060> now<00:05:26.240> if<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.510> vineyard<00:05:26.780> were<00:05:26.900> oriented

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
right now if the vineyard were oriented

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.379 
right now if the vineyard were oriented
this<00:05:27.590> way<00:05:27.650> then<00:05:28.430> obviously<00:05:28.610> you'd<00:05:29.000> have<00:05:29.150> one

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
this way then obviously you'd have one

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.790 
this way then obviously you'd have one
side<00:05:29.599> of<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.810> vineyard<00:05:29.990> being<00:05:30.320> constantly

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
side of the vineyard being constantly

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.400 
side of the vineyard being constantly
exposed<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:32.270> Sun<00:05:32.539> and<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.990> other<00:05:33.139> side

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
exposed to the Sun and the other side

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.790 
exposed to the Sun and the other side
would<00:05:33.560> get<00:05:33.919> virtually<00:05:34.340> no<00:05:34.520> Sun<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.710> you

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
would get virtually no Sun and and you

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.990 
would get virtually no Sun and and you
really<00:05:37.130> wouldn't<00:05:37.340> want<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:37.580> because<00:05:37.820> you'd

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
really wouldn't want that because you'd

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.659 
really wouldn't want that because you'd
have<00:05:38.120> very<00:05:38.330> uneven<00:05:38.810> rate<00:05:39.229> of<00:05:39.380> ripening<00:05:39.830> so

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
have very uneven rate of ripening so

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.490 
have very uneven rate of ripening so
this<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.150> probably<00:05:41.389> about<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.960> best<00:05:41.990> we<00:05:42.349> can

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
this is probably about the best we can

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.629 
this is probably about the best we can
do<00:05:42.710> in<00:05:43.070> order<00:05:43.370> to<00:05:43.669> to<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:45.740> orient<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.160> vine<00:05:46.340> so

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
do in order to to to orient the vine so

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.370 
do in order to to to orient the vine so
that<00:05:46.789> does<00:05:46.970> get<00:05:47.240> optimal<00:05:47.780> ripeness<00:05:47.960> but

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
that does get optimal ripeness but

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.360 
that does get optimal ripeness but
you're<00:05:48.530> always<00:05:48.620> going<00:05:48.830> to<00:05:48.860> have<00:05:48.919> that<00:05:49.190> one

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
you're always going to have that one

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.750 
you're always going to have that one
little<00:05:49.639> issue<00:05:50.389> with<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:51.130> one<00:05:52.130> side<00:05:52.370> getting<00:05:52.669> a

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
little issue with the one side getting a

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.250 
little issue with the one side getting a
little<00:05:52.880> more<00:05:53.060> raisin<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.810> other<00:05:53.960> side

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
little more raisin and the other side

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.320 
little more raisin and the other side
you<00:05:54.620> know<00:05:54.680> maybe<00:05:54.860> having<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.460> little<00:05:56.060> rope<00:05:56.210> we

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
you know maybe having a little rope we

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.170 
you know maybe having a little rope we
call<00:05:56.510> a<00:05:56.539> cooler<00:05:56.900> weather<00:05:57.169> feature<00:05:57.970> meaning<00:05:58.970> a

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
call a cooler weather feature meaning a

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.210 
call a cooler weather feature meaning a
little<00:05:59.599> more<00:05:59.720> little<00:06:00.139> less<00:06:00.289> fruit<00:06:00.710> develop<00:06:01.070> a

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
little more little less fruit develop a

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.770 
little more little less fruit develop a
little<00:06:01.310> more<00:06:01.490> vegetal<00:06:01.910> the<00:06:02.270> skins<00:06:02.570> are<00:06:02.750> a

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
little more vegetal the skins are a

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.890 
little more vegetal the skins are a
little<00:06:02.900> more<00:06:03.050> stringent<00:06:03.380> and<00:06:04.720> but<00:06:05.720> that's

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
little more stringent and but that's

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.620 
little more stringent and but that's
again<00:06:06.260> that's<00:06:06.440> in<00:06:06.880> this<00:06:07.880> vertical<00:06:08.300> trellis

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
again that's in this vertical trellis

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.110 
again that's in this vertical trellis
system<00:06:09.039> some<00:06:10.039> of<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.190> older<00:06:10.220> trail<00:06:10.669> systems

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
system some of the older trail systems

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.300 
system some of the older trail systems
would<00:06:11.270> have<00:06:11.449> much<00:06:11.660> wider<00:06:11.960> wires<00:06:12.530> here<00:06:12.919> spread

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
would have much wider wires here spread

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.279 
would have much wider wires here spread
out<00:06:13.460> and<00:06:13.639> you'd<00:06:13.880> see<00:06:14.090> the<00:06:14.240> canopy<00:06:14.630> coming<00:06:14.960> over

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
out and you'd see the canopy coming over

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.279 
out and you'd see the canopy coming over
and<00:06:15.500> then<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.639> vine<00:06:16.849> would<00:06:17.090> actually<00:06:17.449> be<00:06:17.660> that

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
and then the vine would actually be that

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.540 
and then the vine would actually be that
the<00:06:18.410> fruiting<00:06:18.710> area<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:18.979> vine<00:06:19.130> it<00:06:19.250> actually

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
the fruiting area the vine it actually

the fruiting area the vine it actually
