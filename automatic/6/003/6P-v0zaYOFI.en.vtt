having<00:03:01.600> trouble<00:03:02.110> telling<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:04.209> a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
having trouble telling I think it's a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.750 
having trouble telling I think it's a
flat<00:03:04.510> grind<00:03:05.190> now<00:03:06.190> let's<00:03:06.340> talk<00:03:06.490> about<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
flat grind now let's talk about the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.350 
flat grind now let's talk about the
blade<00:03:06.940> shape<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.630> would<00:03:08.590> call<00:03:09.100> this<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> spear

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
blade shape I would call this a spear

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.560 
blade shape I would call this a spear
point<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:11.400> get<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.580> confused<00:03:12.790> between<00:03:13.150> spear

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
point I get so confused between spear

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.780 
point I get so confused between spear
points<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.020> drop<00:03:14.200> points<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:14.650> let<00:03:14.800> me<00:03:14.950> let<00:03:15.760> me

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
points and drop points but let me let me

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.490 
points and drop points but let me let me
explain<00:03:15.880> why<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.390> would<00:03:16.720> call<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.140> spear

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
explain why I would call this a spear

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.740 
explain why I would call this a spear
point<00:03:17.800> because<00:03:18.730> it's<00:03:18.910> symmetrical<00:03:19.480> about<00:03:19.600> a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
point because it's symmetrical about a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.710 
point because it's symmetrical about a
horizontal<00:03:20.200> axis<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.700> curve<00:03:22.060> if<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.300> mirror

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
horizontal axis this curve if you mirror

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.470 
horizontal axis this curve if you mirror
it<00:03:22.870> equals<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.440> true<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.800> drop<00:03:27.160> point

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
it equals that true this is a drop point

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.720 
it equals that true this is a drop point
it's<00:03:28.480> not<00:03:28.630> symmetrical<00:03:29.350> then<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.040> drops<00:03:30.370> to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it's not symmetrical then it drops to

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.030 
it's not symmetrical then it drops to
the<00:03:31.180> tip<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.690> would<00:03:32.260> call<00:03:32.440> this<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:32.769> you're<00:03:32.890> I'm
