vendor<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.439> stands<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> reason<00:01:53.220> samsung

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
vendor that stands to reason samsung

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.660 
vendor that stands to reason samsung
though<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> only<00:01:55.219> vendor<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.520> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
though is the only vendor that is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
though is the only vendor that is
relying<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.479> Google's<00:01:58.409> Android<00:01:58.590> operating

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
relying on Google's Android operating

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
relying on Google's Android operating
system<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.729> making<00:02:00.060> any<00:02:00.180> money<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
system that's making any money it's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.230 
system that's making any money it's
basically<00:02:01.469> Apple<00:02:01.979> Samsung<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.149> then

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
basically Apple Samsung and then

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
basically Apple Samsung and then
everybody<00:02:03.689> else<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> surprise<00:02:05.189> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
everybody else so it's a surprise that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
everybody else so it's a surprise that
Google<00:02:05.700> wouldn't<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.000> turning<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.659> samsung

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
Google wouldn't be turning the samsung

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.190 
Google wouldn't be turning the samsung
for<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.829> Samsung<00:02:08.190> obviously<00:02:09.200> seems

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
for this because Samsung obviously seems

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.610 
for this because Samsung obviously seems
to<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.550> struck<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> chord<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.030> people

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to have struck a chord with people

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
to have struck a chord with people
the<00:02:13.739> devices<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.670> want<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.970> have

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the devices that they they want to have

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.170 
the devices that they they want to have
you<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.440> think<00:02:16.769> as<00:02:17.280> far<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.670> Android

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
you know I think as far as Android

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.050 
you know I think as far as Android
devices<00:02:18.989> are<00:02:19.260> concerned<00:02:19.670> Samsung<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.700> pretty

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
devices are concerned Samsung is pretty

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.080 
devices are concerned Samsung is pretty
much<00:02:21.239> one<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> leaders<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.920> field

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
much one of the leaders in the field

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.930 
much one of the leaders in the field
asus<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.540> course<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:25.680> say<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.159> just<00:02:26.730> as

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
asus of course I would say is is just as

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.570 
asus of course I would say is is just as
doing<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.170> well<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.620> Samsung<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.400> terms

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
doing just as well as Samsung in terms

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.970 
doing just as well as Samsung in terms
of<00:02:29.670> how<00:02:29.819> they're<00:02:30.090> approaching<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:31.049> ecosystem

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
of how they're approaching the ecosystem

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.759 
of how they're approaching the ecosystem
but<00:02:32.489> Google<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.780> worried<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.319> think

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
but Google is a little worried I think

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.750 
but Google is a little worried I think
you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.989> android<00:02:37.920> tablet<00:02:38.370> adoption

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
you know the android tablet adoption

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.460 
you know the android tablet adoption
hasn't<00:02:39.209> been<00:02:39.950> as<00:02:41.150> warm<00:02:42.150> as<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.110> Google

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
hasn't been as warm as I think Google

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.199 
hasn't been as warm as I think Google
would<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.680> liked<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.099> be<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.459> course<00:02:44.730> you

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
would have liked it to be of course you

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.670 
would have liked it to be of course you
know<00:02:45.299> i'm<00:02:45.569> sure<00:02:45.750> other<00:02:45.959> android<00:02:46.290> supporters

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
know i'm sure other android supporters

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.500 
know i'm sure other android supporters
would<00:02:46.799> have<00:02:46.920> wanted<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.549> be<00:02:47.640> stronger<00:02:48.390> as

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
would have wanted it to be stronger as

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.420 
would have wanted it to be stronger as
well<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.410> not<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> say<00:02:49.859> that<00:02:49.890> android

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
well and that's not to say that android

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.800 
well and that's not to say that android
isn't<00:02:50.700> doing<00:02:50.879> well<00:02:51.000> at<00:02:51.150> all<00:02:51.209> it's<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:51.629> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
isn't doing well at all it's not the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.039 
isn't doing well at all it's not the
case<00:02:51.989> at<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:52.230> because<00:02:53.220> when<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:54.030> an<00:02:54.780> eco

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
case at all because when you have an eco

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.110 
case at all because when you have an eco
system<00:02:55.290> whereby<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.950> produce<00:02:56.220> hundreds<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
system whereby you produce hundreds of

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.039 
system whereby you produce hundreds of
devices<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.650> sell<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.310> lot<00:03:00.049> vs

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
devices it's going to sell a lot vs

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.649 
devices it's going to sell a lot vs
let's<00:03:01.590> say<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.799> were<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.579> compare<00:03:02.670> android

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
let's say if you were to compare android

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.039 
let's say if you were to compare android
devices<00:03:03.930> sold<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.890> apple<00:03:05.609> devices<00:03:05.819> sold<00:03:06.239> they

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
devices sold to apple devices sold they

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.390 
devices sold to apple devices sold they
may<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.290> pretty<00:03:07.680> close<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.069> i<00:03:08.159> would<00:03:08.310> say

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
may be pretty close but i would say

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.800 
may be pretty close but i would say
androids<00:03:08.849> probably<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.359> edged<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.629> if

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
androids probably going to edged out if

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.630 
androids probably going to edged out if
only<00:03:09.900> because<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.829> thousands<00:03:11.489> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
only because you have thousands of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.970 
only because you have thousands of
android<00:03:12.060> devices<00:03:12.480> versus<00:03:13.049> maybe<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.409> handful

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
android devices versus maybe a handful

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.130 
android devices versus maybe a handful
of<00:03:14.190> iOS<00:03:14.909> devices<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.659> stands<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.959> reason

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
of iOS devices it just stands to reason

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.110 
of iOS devices it just stands to reason
that<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.530> would<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.680> more<00:03:16.950> out<00:03:17.159> there<00:03:17.400> if

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
that there would be more out there if

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.620 
that there would be more out there if
you<00:03:18.299> have<00:03:18.510> more<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.139> them<00:03:19.290> out<00:03:19.410> there<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:20.630> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
you have more of them out there the the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.860 
you have more of them out there the the
the<00:03:21.660> issue<00:03:22.139> with<00:03:22.380> tablets<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.870> nobody's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
the issue with tablets is that nobody's

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
currently Apple I think Windows 8 is

currently Apple I think Windows 8 is
going<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.859> give<00:03:38.040> Android<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> run<00:03:39.150> for<00:03:39.359> its

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
going to give Android a run for its

going to give Android a run for its
money<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:39.810> far<00:03:40.019> as<00:03:40.109> tablet<00:03:40.709> computers<00:03:41.579> are

money as far as tablet computers are

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.930 
money as far as tablet computers are

dollars<00:06:21.420> on<00:06:21.570> a<00:06:21.600> tablet<00:06:22.050> I'd<00:06:22.380> rather<00:06:22.530> spend<00:06:22.920> two

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
dollars on a tablet I'd rather spend two

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.380 
dollars on a tablet I'd rather spend two
hundred<00:06:23.310> dollars<00:06:23.520> yeah<00:06:23.850> of<00:06:23.970> course<00:06:24.240> you'd

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
hundred dollars yeah of course you'd

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.420

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
rather spend less money well that's the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.030 
rather spend less money well that's the
thing<00:06:26.640> Google<00:06:27.360> is<00:06:27.390> competing<00:06:27.840> against<00:06:28.410> Amazon

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
thing Google is competing against Amazon
