bit pricey but I mean I've had it for
going<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:17.609> about<00:03:17.909> two<00:03:18.060> months<00:03:18.359> now

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.500 
going on I think about two months now
and<00:03:19.099> well<00:03:20.099> I<00:03:20.159> was<00:03:20.340> using<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.819> for<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.479> a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
and well I was using it for that for a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.110 
and well I was using it for that for a
month<00:03:22.139> straight<00:03:22.229> you<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.400> see<00:03:23.579> how<00:03:23.819> much<00:03:23.940> is

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
month straight you can see how much is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.460 
month straight you can see how much is
gone<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:26.299> being<00:03:27.299> two<00:03:27.479> months<00:03:27.840> it's<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.169> always

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
gone so being two months it's not always

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.580 
gone so being two months it's not always
it's<00:03:28.829> not<00:03:28.889> full<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.169> still<00:03:31.319> have<00:03:31.500> a
