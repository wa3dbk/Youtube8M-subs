00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.160
 researchers from Pará and Ceará 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.589
 discovered that the Amazon has the largest 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.490
 underground water reservoir 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.920
 planet 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 the alter aquifer of the ground was already 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.880
 known to scientists, they just do not 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.119
 They knew it was so big. 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 the report is by daniela assayag e 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 nowhere else 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 she is so fed up taking the glacier in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.210
 of the world's freshwater 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 the Amazon seems to be much more 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.399
 lakes here concentrate only the part 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.120
 visible from this treasure under the earth 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.200
 there are giant lakes of drinking water 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.059
 called aquifers 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
 until now the largest on the planet was the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.530
 Guarani that spreads across Brazil 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 paraguay argentina and uruguay 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.570
 but a group of researchers has just 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.390
 reveal that the aquifer alter the ground 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.660
 extends through the Amazon para and amapá 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.780
 is almost twice as large as it represents 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.730
 a water volume of 86 thousand kilometers 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 cubic if we compare with the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.409
 Guarani aquifer for example he has in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 around 45 thousand cubic kilometers 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.000
 the majority of the Guarani aquifer in the south 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.240
 Brazil is under the rock already the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.040
 aquifer in the Amazon has sandy soil 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.979
 when the rain falls it penetrates with 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 soil ease makes a species 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.970
 water filter from the reservoir 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 underground then arrives clean good for 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 drilling the sand floor is easy and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.060
 the station does not even need a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.130
 chemical treatment in the house of martyr 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.369
 the water goes straight to faucet can 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.100
 drink well clean 10 thousand wells 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.920
 private 30 percent of the republic 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.750
 already use the aquifer to supply 40 per 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.970
 percent of the population of manaus 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 but most of the city still 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.720
 defends of the water of the rivers you can 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.729
 supply all cities within the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.040
 scheme of the amazon with the foot on the ground without 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 no problem is to stop using those 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.799
 all surface waters are all 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.780
 contaminated 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.870
 you can replace it all with water 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.640
 underground 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.619
 the researchers want help from the agency 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.320
 national water system and the world 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.570
 to complete the study on the planet 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.790
 threatened by heating the aquifer 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.770
 alter floor is a strategic reserve 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.380
 of the area to beat if the entire population 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.380
 of the world 300 or 400 years
