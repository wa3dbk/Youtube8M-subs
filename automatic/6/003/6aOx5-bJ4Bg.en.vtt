all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.650> here's<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:03.230> three-legged<00:00:04.230> -

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
all right here's the three-legged -

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.030 
all right here's the three-legged -
puller<00:00:05.000> she<00:00:06.000> goes<00:00:06.180> up<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.540> down<00:00:07.040> constraints

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
puller she goes up and down constraints

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.530 
puller she goes up and down constraints
comes<00:00:08.460> up<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.940> can't<00:00:09.300> let<00:00:09.570> out<00:00:09.750> pin<00:00:10.650> get<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
comes up this can't let out pin get the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.709 
comes up this can't let out pin get the
bolt<00:00:12.540> screws<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.380> out<00:00:13.530> pops<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.549> off<00:00:14.719> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
bolt screws in and out pops it off and

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.420 
bolt screws in and out pops it off and
the<00:00:15.809> way<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.139> works<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> all<00:00:16.890> locks<00:00:17.190> in

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the way this works is it all locks in

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.779 
the way this works is it all locks in
around<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.300> threaded<00:00:18.840> collar<00:00:19.460> easier<00:00:20.460> threaded

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
around a threaded collar easier threaded

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.740 
around a threaded collar easier threaded
collar<00:00:21.529> is<00:00:22.529> your<00:00:22.800> lock<00:00:22.980> nut<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.730> screws<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
collar is your lock nut that screws the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.580 
collar is your lock nut that screws the
yokes<00:00:25.279> for<00:00:26.279> both<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.640> two-legged<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.109> his

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
yokes for both the two-legged is it his

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
yokes for both the two-legged is it his
world<00:00:28.830> explodes<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:31.790> two-legged<00:00:32.790> view<00:00:35.149> so

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
world explodes out two-legged view so

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.069 
world explodes out two-legged view so
pin<00:00:36.750> comes<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:38.180> that<00:00:39.180> goes<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
pin comes out that goes up and down and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
pin comes out that goes up and down and
there's<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> washer<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> while<00:00:42.090> she<00:00:42.210> goes<00:00:42.329> on

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
there's the washer so while she goes on

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.240 
there's the washer so while she goes on
top<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.489> screws<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.450> look

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
top this actually screws in if we look

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.180 
top this actually screws in if we look
look<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.760> there's<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.180> thread<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.200> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
look in here there's a thread in here so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.020 
look in here there's a thread in here so
the<00:00:51.289> cult<00:00:52.289> our<00:00:52.500> threaded<00:00:52.800> collar<00:00:53.340> screws<00:00:53.820> up

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the cult our threaded collar screws up

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.360 
the cult our threaded collar screws up
in<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.420> lock<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.500> screws<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
in there lock that screws down that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150 
in there lock that screws down that
locks<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.320> opposing<00:00:58.710> thread

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
locks it in for the two opposing thread

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.119 
locks it in for the two opposing thread
lock<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> pin<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.230> through<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> work

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
lock and the pin can go through and work

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
lock and the pin can go through and work
as<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> pull<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> two-legged

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
as a pull off so this is a two-legged

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.980 
as a pull off so this is a two-legged
with<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> bearing<00:01:04.199> separator<00:01:05.869> there's<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
with the bearing separator there's a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.810 
with the bearing separator there's a
three-legged<00:01:07.590> job'<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:10.229> here's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
three-legged job' and then here's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.490 
three-legged job' and then here's
three-legged<00:01:11.820> during

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.250 

the<00:01:18.500> two-legged<00:01:19.040> drawing<00:01:19.690> as<00:01:20.690> you<00:01:21.020> can<00:01:21.140> see

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
the two-legged drawing as you can see

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.290 
the two-legged drawing as you can see
it's<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.500> letter<00:01:21.680> work<00:01:21.950> cells<00:01:22.340> lining<00:01:23.000> out<00:01:23.150> this

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
it's a letter work cells lining out this

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.000 
it's a letter work cells lining out this
one<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:25.280> course<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.440> parts<00:01:27.440> there's<00:01:27.890> all

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
one and of course the parts there's all

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.660 
one and of course the parts there's all
the<00:01:28.130> parts

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
the parts

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.570 
the parts
I'll<00:01:28.790> dimensional<00:01:29.300> load<00:01:29.480> up<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:29.870> way<00:01:30.860> when

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
I'll dimensional load up that way when

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.130 
I'll dimensional load up that way when
they<00:01:31.700> make<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> two<00:01:32.360> legged<00:01:32.600> yoke<00:01:32.870> they're

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
they make the two legged yoke they're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.460 
they make the two legged yoke they're
using<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.830> assume<00:01:34.460> n<00:01:34.640> mil<00:01:34.880> maybe<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.300> slab<00:01:35.630> do

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
using it I assume n mil maybe a slab do

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.040 
using it I assume n mil maybe a slab do
this<00:01:36.680> major<00:01:37.300> machining<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.440> they<00:01:39.620> got<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:41.050> bore

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
this major machining and they got a bore

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.830 
this major machining and they got a bore
out<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.290> center<00:01:42.910> maybe<00:01:43.910> not<00:01:44.120> bore<00:01:44.450> than<00:01:44.720> what

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
out the center maybe not bore than what

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.390 
out the center maybe not bore than what
never<00:01:45.080> had<00:01:45.290> big<00:01:45.500> enough<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.860> bore<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.280> out

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
never had big enough to bore it out

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.060 
never had big enough to bore it out
might<00:01:47.210> be<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.390> drill<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:47.750> ream<00:01:48.070> definitely

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
might be the drill and ream definitely

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.770 
might be the drill and ream definitely
needs<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.250> bore<00:01:49.490> this<00:01:49.640> bit<00:01:49.880> out<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.540> there's<00:01:50.720> a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
needs a bore this bit out so there's a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.570 
needs a bore this bit out so there's a
bit<00:01:50.900> of<00:01:50.960> boring<00:01:51.290> in<00:01:51.410> there<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.740> starts<00:01:52.130> its

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
bit of boring in there that starts its

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.090 
bit of boring in there that starts its
life<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.120> solid<00:01:53.360> block<00:01:53.750> which<00:01:54.710> they<00:01:54.890> then

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
life as a solid block which they then

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.520 
life as a solid block which they then
turn<00:01:55.910> in<00:01:56.120> a<00:01:56.210> four<00:01:56.420> jaw<00:01:56.600> Chuck<00:01:56.630> I'm<00:01:57.350> going<00:01:57.470> to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
turn in a four jaw Chuck I'm going to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.730 
turn in a four jaw Chuck I'm going to
make<00:01:57.710> these<00:01:57.860> little<00:01:57.920> bolts<00:01:58.370> here<00:01:58.580> up<00:01:58.820> as<00:01:59.000> well

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
make these little bolts here up as well

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.360 
make these little bolts here up as well
spaces<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.900> three-legged<00:02:03.680> yoke<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.720> UM

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
spaces the the three-legged yoke the UM

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.170 
spaces the the three-legged yoke the UM
links<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.060> legs<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:09.110> well<00:02:09.320> as<00:02:09.440> collar<00:02:10.180> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
links and the legs as well as collar so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.820 
links and the legs as well as collar so
I<00:02:11.210> reckon<00:02:11.510> that's<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.810> pretty<00:02:12.290> good<00:02:12.590> assessment

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
I reckon that's a pretty good assessment

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.790 
I reckon that's a pretty good assessment
for<00:02:13.580> those<00:02:13.730> three<00:02:14.290> units<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.440> study<00:02:16.240> nice

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
for those three units of study nice

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.459 
for those three units of study nice
challenging<00:02:18.800> project<00:02:19.360> I'll<00:02:20.950> see<00:02:21.950> how<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.160> goes
