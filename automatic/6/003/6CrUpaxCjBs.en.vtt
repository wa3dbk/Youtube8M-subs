00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.670
 Hello colleagues 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.059
 the topic of our lesson is lichen 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.350
 when we walk for example down the street we can 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.560
 see them as 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:22.480
 yellow or gray spots on the walls of houses 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.200
 on lampposts on the bark of trees 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.070
 kettles 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.790
 in appearance there are three 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.960
 species 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.980
 so saying 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.660
 scientists they have 3 life forms 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.860
 life forms of lichen it's like 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.530
 say organismic level 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.290
 organizations are worth looking at 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.150
 lichens and on a smaller level 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.180
 organizations to look with increase 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.210
 under the microscope we will see the most important 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 lichen strangeness is not easy 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 the organism is an organism the compound it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.980
 consists of mushroom and kelp first 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.020
 queue need to understand how each other 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.170
 two such different his 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.900
 component mushrooms and whole colony 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 single cell algae 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.780
 Well, the relationship between them immediately say in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.230
 Overall a good normal relationship even 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.190
 they help each other lichens are 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.340
 painted 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.620
 which means one can make paint 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 Well, people have learned to make 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.480
 some lichen paint 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 really but there is one amazing 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.610
 substance 1 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 completely magic paint which from 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.130
 lichen get called she 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.680
 litmus 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.649
 paint can not paint anything honestly 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.860
 I confess to you but this paint can 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.620
 change your color 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.320
 scientifically such paints are called 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.500
 indicators and you will meet them in 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.500
 chemistry course 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.210
 i have a little litmus 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.400
 we will dissolve 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.400
 in some water 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.620
 need a little chat 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.770
 dissolved in water but little by little you 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 you see 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.750
 the water gets so purple 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.310
 color is exactly the color of the dissolved 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 litmus 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.720
 if we drop something here now 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.900
 sour 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.670
 Here I have a lemon for example 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.670
 then it will change its color
