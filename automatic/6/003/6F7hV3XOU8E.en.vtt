00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.439
 hello to you, Dmitriy Aleksandrovich 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.090
 we have today another project related 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.400
 with designers firm lego under 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 name hero factory in which in 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.269
 this game we have to manage not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 one superheroes and the whole team and 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.190
 although they have no 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.089
 superpowers but think in mechanics 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 the story begins with a simple 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.449
 building a tunnel in a big city and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 kind of shallow cavalli 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.050
 however, this was enough to stumble across 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.850
 earth on robots unknown 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.449
 origin is very aggressive and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.309
 dangerous 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.739
 it is with them that we have to fight 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.449
 since there are no superpowers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.040
 as I say, they have to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.570
 use combat vehicles in order 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.309
 to somehow equalize forces with 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 the opponent in general the game is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 platform shooter territory will be 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.400
 limited and and we will have to jump on 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.020
 construction to keep up with 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 enemies and have time to complete the task 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.220
 task will be of two types to destroy 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 especially living adversary or collect on 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 locations required number of parts 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 to be hidden in a gray container 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 can also be in containers 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.920
 various bonuses that improve 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 the characteristics of our combat spacesuit 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.480
 which only 5 namely energy reserve 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.850
 from the same amount of health speed 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.520
 movement springiness impact force and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.260
 melee combat and power shots from 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.180
 I'll say myself in the whole graphics in the game 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.430
 not bad I really liked without weak 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.470
 the brightness inherent in games from lek and very 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.690
 like videos between games or locations 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.190
 very good and high quality at the beginning 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.200
 generally it seems that 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.590
 watch a cartoon and then you play 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.180
 him so play each of the characters 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.159
 Suck your hero and his powerful 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.750
 design and subscribe to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.490
