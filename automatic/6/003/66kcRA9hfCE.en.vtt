00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
how did you in a quick nutshell

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.270 
how did you in a quick nutshell
calculate<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.049> demographics<00:01:15.649> on<00:01:15.799> what<00:01:16.100> our

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
calculate the demographics on what our

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.399 
calculate the demographics on what our
area<00:01:16.729> could<00:01:16.909> sustain<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:17.870> there's<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.200> long

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
area could sustain so there's a long

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.320 
area could sustain so there's a long
formula<00:01:19.130> that's<00:01:19.310> actually<00:01:19.580> if<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.030> go<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
formula that's actually if you go to the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.570 
formula that's actually if you go to the
website<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.470> click<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.250> link<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
here I come there's a long formula that

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.960 
here I come there's a long formula that
that<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.750> created<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.290> help<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.650> determine<00:01:31.520> or

important thing is the
you're<00:01:38.080> going<00:01:38.260> to<00:01:38.350> need<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.680> charge<00:01:39.150> enough<00:01:40.150> to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
you're going to need to charge enough to

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.000 
you're going to need to charge enough to
stay<00:01:40.540> in<00:01:40.570> business<00:01:40.840> enough<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.560> profitable

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.479 
know what the service is worth yeah and
I<00:02:59.049> think<00:02:59.350> some<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.950> things<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.280> people

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
I think some of the things that people

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.350 
I think some of the things that people
could<00:03:02.040> insinuate<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.150> if

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
could insinuate that is going on if

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.940 
could insinuate that is going on if
you're<00:03:04.510> charging<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.019> considerable<00:03:05.680> amount

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
you're charging a considerable amount

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.020 
you're charging a considerable amount
less<00:03:06.250> there's<00:03:06.459> nothing<00:03:06.760> wrong<00:03:06.850> with<00:03:06.910> being

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
less there's nothing wrong with being

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.310 
less there's nothing wrong with being
competitive<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.750> being<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.989> couple<00:03:08.140> of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
competitive and being a couple of

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.580 
competitive and being a couple of
dollars<00:03:08.470> less<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.840> think<00:03:11.200> people<00:03:11.320> would

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
dollars less but I think people would

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.259 
dollars less but I think people would
start<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.890> insinuate<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.730> don't<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.030> enough

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
start to insinuate you don't have enough

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.460 
start to insinuate you don't have enough
people<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.690> your<00:03:13.840> facility<00:03:14.410> right<00:03:14.829> your<00:03:15.370> your

people in your facility right your your

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.250 
people in your facility right your your
