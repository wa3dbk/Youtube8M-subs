00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.071
 Ok, ShokoTeam in the square, will need some space 

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:36.150
 I did not understand that lack of talent to reach this class 

00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.290
 Do you want more? I thought you had Pigé. 

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:42.021
 The last time we met you, you got fucked. 

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:44.212
 Listen to me these lines, these rhymes and these punchlines. 

00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:47.160
 We have more style than Horatio and more brain than Einstein! 

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.191
 But that's another story, let's talk about you! 

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:53.142
 Let's see if your damn flow still holds up! 

00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:56.083
 We attack, it hurts! Nothing more banal! 

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.044
 You must have underestimated the power of your own 

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.245
 We're up bro, do not try to do the show 

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:05.000
 Listen and feel the flow. Hey, we're just a little too high! 

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.231
 Every day, people have their dose of fun 

00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:10.182
 While you are rowing, we made young people laugh. 

00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:13.093
 When is this part? Stop your shokoki 

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:16.120
 You will finish boiled. Hey, we're the Zero Gravity! 

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:19.001
 So that's what you dare to call a rap battle? 

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.242
 On one side that clash, on the other it gets farted mouth? 

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:24.130
 One or two pipes do not take us high, the potos! 

00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:27.271
 You are clearly not level! Ho! Gravity Zero! 

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:30.132
 There are guys who come on your channel to say you're plagiarizing 

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.123
 To these people I say GG, they knew how to join the good side! 

00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:36.000
 Will someone explain to me who is watching your videos? 

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.071
 Dad, mom, 13400 ghost accounts and two three shokos. 

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:41.252
 Listen, guys! This noise, this noise! 

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:44.243
 We make more buzz on the web than the other Débilla 

00:01:44.244 --> 00:01:47.164
 Do not talk fun, guys! This is our domain! 

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:50.195
 To see you're struggling, you can repack your chain! 

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:53.150
 PGM or FAIL? This question made us doubt! 

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.111
 Now that you are clashed, the answer is all! 

00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:57.112
 The guys you challenged us for the second time! 

00:01:57.113 --> 00:02:02.033
 I think it is now time to bow down before the kings! 

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.164
 It was a joke, or false accusations? 

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:07.145
 There is nothing to plagiarize, and it is not ready to arrive! 

00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:10.146
 Your channel is as deplorable as the brain of ShokoFight 

00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:13.137
 And your defeat will make more of a sight than the Gangnam Style 

00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:16.068
 You mate our deliriums, mad-laughs, and our montages 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.010
 And you feel that rage in you. 

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.271
 Would it be jealousy? Many people will tell us that yes. 

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:24.252
 So do your part, do not spend the night! 

00:02:24.253 --> 00:02:27.133
 We must turn the page, before we shipwreck 

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:30.184
 You did not understand that we are the kings of the funeral 

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:33.105
 Come down to earth guys, here is the zG. 

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:36.106
 We do not play in the same class, you are overestimated! 

00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:39.047
 We both know who leads the dance, it's obvious. 

00:02:39.048 --> 00:02:42.028
 Besides, we're wondering if you can follow the pace. 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.250
 Two defeats at once? I hope you'll hold on! 

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.171
 All these humiliations, it starts to do a lot! 

00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:51.202
