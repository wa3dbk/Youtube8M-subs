practice piece tutorial just so I could

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.800 
practice piece tutorial just so I could
do<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.650> that's<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.279> doing<00:00:26.369> today<00:00:26.810> now

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
do it so that's what I'm doing today now

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
do it so that's what I'm doing today now
start<00:00:28.199> off<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.619> doing<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> practice<00:00:29.640> piece

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
start off by doing the practice piece

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
start off by doing the practice piece
normal<00:00:30.420> speed<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> would<00:00:31.679> be

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
normal speed how I think it would be

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.520 
normal speed how I think it would be
done<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.160> mean<00:00:33.090> obviously<00:00:33.360> George<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
done I mean obviously George is the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.020 
done I mean obviously George is the
original<00:00:34.829> person<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> did<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.790> you're

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
original person that did it so you're

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.400 
original person that did it so you're
never<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> get<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.780> perfect<00:00:37.290> as

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
never going to get it as perfect as

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.010 
never going to get it as perfect as
George<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:38.760> doing<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> how<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> believe<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
George but I'm doing it how I believe is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.139 
George but I'm doing it how I believe is
the<00:00:40.379> correct<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the correct way that I think to do it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
the correct way that I think to do it
and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:43.050> others<00:00:43.500> might<00:00:43.649> learn<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and I think others might learn from it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
and I think others might learn from it
so<00:00:44.640> I'll<00:00:45.450> start<00:00:45.750> off<00:00:45.840> by<00:00:45.899> doing<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.350> normal

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so I'll start off by doing it normal

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:23.320 
so I'll start off by doing it normal
speed<00:00:46.950> dial<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.879> do

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.500 

now<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.510> I<00:01:24.660> believe<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.330> much

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
now that's I believe I do it and so much

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.790 
now that's I believe I do it and so much
learn<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.560> I'll<00:01:28.619> do

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
learn from it so that's what I'll do

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.330 
learn from it so that's what I'll do
today

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
today

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370 
today
now<00:01:29.790> I'll<00:01:30.119> slow<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.420> down<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.990> put<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
now I'll slow it down and put the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.469 
now I'll slow it down and put the
fretboard<00:01:31.710> closer<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> screen<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
fretboard closer to the screen so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:02:44.140 
fretboard closer to the screen so
they'll<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:35.009> start<00:01:35.340> slow<00:01:35.580> now

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.930 

so<00:02:45.230> that's<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.409> tutorial<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.920> today<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.879> I
