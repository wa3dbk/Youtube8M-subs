00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hi, I'm the Navarrese teacher and in this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.290
 video I'll tell you how you can be 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.269
 more productive with music is not about 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 fundamentally that although if you're 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.280
 music student is now a musician 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 professional to be more productive not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's about studying more hours of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 study more time is about using 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 the time that you have in a very much 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 smarter to take advantage of much more 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 the time and get better results by 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.439
 example if you are an instrumentalist of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.449
 nothing serves you for example if you have to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 learn a new new composition 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.710
 work for flute for example suppose 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.760
 the flutist since there's any 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.829
 nothing that you are touching from the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.510
 beginning to the end and that you repeat 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120
 constantly but from what is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 is that those passages that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.719
 really be more complicated where 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.510
 have to overcome some kind of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.940
 technical or musical problem those passages 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.289
 you see them separately and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 establish is a series of exercises 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.000
 that will help you overcome these 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.699
 problems that can be technical 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.920
 interpretations of that work in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.589
 concrete and therefore you go 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 detecting what the black dots are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.150
 that may exist in that work 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 the difficulties you may have of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.560
 interpretation tuning sound 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.400
 etcetera and go solving each one of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 those problems individually 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.090
 solve the problem not only 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 gets repeating and nothing else but 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.530
 fundamentally I would encourage you to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.030
 first place you made a diagnosis of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.130
 problem is to say because this passage 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.409
 because this concrete passage is for me 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.330
 difficult once you know why you 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.970
 it is difficult you have to make a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.280
 kind of diagnosis of that problem to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.990
 see where that difficulty is and then 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.850
 how can you make a kind of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.130
 treatment how can you overcome that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.500
 difficulty there are times that for example if 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.590
 it's a mechanical problem because what 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.630
 better you will be able to overcome that difficulty 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 posing exercises that help you 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.550
 improve that problem even if it's not 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.409
 let's say strictly related to 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.990
 those scores but let's say what 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.420
 better a mechanism to be able to work 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.190
 a certain combination of positions 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.259
 for example the flute so you're going to 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.940
 work the first thing apart as if it were 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.319
 a technical mechanical exercises and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.270
 when you have overcome it when 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.520
 get the habit now 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.920
 do it again in the specific passage 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.170
 where you were failing if they are problems 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.940
 of tuning you also have to see 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.980
 why does that problem of 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.570
 tuning if you're playing some kind of 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.070
 instrument see if the position that you're 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.800
 using is the most appropriate can 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.750
 have a new position and see how 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.820
 you can do what treatment what 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.340
 strategy you can continue to overcome 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.960
 that technical problem but this way 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.760
 way first 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.590
 pointing out what those black spots are 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 the problems the difficulties he has 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.110
 every work you know there are many works 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.460
 that 90% are not going to have any 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.960
 kind of problem but there are passages 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.390
 concrete that's where it is 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.490
 concentrated all the difficulty and they are 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.010
 those passages and us what you have to 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.350
 detect and those that you have to attack 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.510
 each one in isolation and solve 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.480
 in isolation when you have solved 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.800
 all these black spots when you have 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.630
 done well the work you are going to give 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.150
 count as in that time if you have not 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.310
 used in this productive way you're going to 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.530
 be able to play the work without any kind of 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.570
 problem and solving all these 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.300
 inconveniences that we have seen that 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.020
 can have and therefore I advise you 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.810
 what to be 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.910
 more productive or productive use your 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.840
 time in an intelligent way and you 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.330
 do a work strategy that is 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.910
 demanding and that goes directly to 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.890
 solve each of the problems 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.840
 directly but not if you liked it 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.760
 this video I'll thank you for 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.280

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.020
 I'm uploading many videos similar to 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.630
 this one that can be interesting for you 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.940
 I would also like very much that I 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.100
 will leave your comment just me just
