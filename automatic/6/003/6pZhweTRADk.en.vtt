you're<00:00:33.840> looking<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.730> northern<00:00:35.730> regions

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you're looking at the northern regions

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.459 
you're looking at the northern regions
all<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.750> sort<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> middle

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
all the way it sort of to the middle

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.780 
all the way it sort of to the middle
they<00:00:37.649> aren't<00:00:37.800> quite<00:00:38.040> high<00:00:38.280> altitudes

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
they aren't quite high altitudes

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
they aren't quite high altitudes
especially<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.930> look<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.260> Celta<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
especially if you look at Celta the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.619 
especially if you look at Celta the
attitudes<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.120> about<00:00:42.770> 200<00:00:44.360> 2,500<00:00:45.360> meters

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

sea<00:00:48.719> level<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.710> high<00:00:50.039> altitude<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
sea level is very high altitude what is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
sea level is very high altitude what is
altitude<00:00:52.079> mean<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> wine<00:00:52.890> itself<00:00:53.100> well

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
altitude mean for the wine itself well

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.010

attitudes<00:00:54.770> allowed<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.730> mud<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.600> slow

maturation<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:59.129> some<00:00:59.370> grapes<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.000> that's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
maturation for some grapes and that's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.139 
maturation for some grapes and that's
mean<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.379> better<00:01:01.710> crop<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> better

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
mean a better crop to have a better

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.590 
mean a better crop to have a better
juice<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.619> produce<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:05.460> intense<00:01:06.210> and

juice and to produce more intense and
deep<00:01:07.049> wines<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> interesting<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
deep wines that is interesting in in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
deep wines that is interesting in in
general<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> course<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
general but of course not all the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.770 
general but of course not all the
varietals<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> same<00:01:14.400> behavior<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
varietals have the same behavior in the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.320 
varietals have the same behavior in the
altitudes<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.460> grapes<00:01:17.850> for

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
altitudes there are some grapes for

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.840 
altitudes there are some grapes for
example<00:01:18.720> cabernet<00:01:19.170> sauvignon<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> not

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
example cabernet sauvignon that is not

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
example cabernet sauvignon that is not
it<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.270> quite<00:01:21.900> difficult<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> good<00:01:23.820> crop

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it is quite difficult to get a good crop

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
it is quite difficult to get a good crop
in<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.770> high<00:01:26.040> altitudes<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.090> for

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
in very very high altitudes but for

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.649 
in very very high altitudes but for
example<00:01:27.659> marvick<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> fantastic<00:01:29.159> between

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
example marvick is fantastic between

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.520 
example marvick is fantastic between
1000<00:01:30.659> meters<00:01:30.960> above<00:01:31.259> sea<00:01:31.320> level<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:33.530> 1500

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
1000 meters above sea level to 1500

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.890 
1000 meters above sea level to 1500
meters<00:01:34.799> above<00:01:35.070> sea<00:01:35.130> level<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.420> found

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
meters above sea level where it's found

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.399 
meters above sea level where it's found
for<00:01:37.710> finding<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> correct<00:01:38.850> altitude<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
for finding the correct altitude for the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.429 
for finding the correct altitude for the
crop<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> altitude<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.659> cools<00:01:43.140> down

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
crop so the altitude really cools down

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
crop so the altitude really cools down
the<00:01:43.649> temperature<00:01:44.299> extends<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> growing

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the temperature extends the growing

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
the temperature extends the growing
season<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.009> you've<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.159> time<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.850> develop<00:01:48.420> all

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
season so you've got time to develop all

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.749 
season so you've got time to develop all
of<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:49.140> great<00:01:49.170> flavors<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.220> wines<00:01:50.460> and

of these great flavors and the wines and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609 
of these great flavors and the wines and
and<00:01:50.939> keep<00:01:51.210> their<00:01:51.420> great<00:01:51.780> acidity<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.290> they're

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
and keep their great acidity so they're

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.039 
and keep their great acidity so they're
