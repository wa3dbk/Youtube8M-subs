00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.740
 higher speed larger brecht chamber 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.900
 with the 11 50 max closes power screen 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.350
 the gap between his models 1000 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.820
 and 1300 the maxxtec 1150 is a after 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.590
 crusher of the stone 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.010
 weeks sand and gravel industry used 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.170
 becomes 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.540
 and as we see them here he will 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.040
 either sent by the criminal 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.170
 means broken material about that 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.820
 Tape or the material will be with the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.920
 wheel loader abandoned and for this purpose 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.200
 these wing plates above office smells 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.450
 because of that you have a broad comfortable 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.710
 task in the crusher has first time 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.720
 is it that way on the way there 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.520
 divided is interposed with 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.470
 Part you do not want burglar 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.180
 if the material then in the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.860
 Crusher comes in then it should be there 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.140
 be crushed or special on the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.850
 Crusher shown here is that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.380
 So roll it up 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.360
 no plain bearings but the powerscan 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.010
 used roll warehouse but the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.739
 can absorb higher forces 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.690
 Higher powers means the operator 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.120
 can drive a higher speed there can 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.320
 You can take advantage of the bigger one 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.659
 Can a higher throughput 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.220
 but especially important there 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.200
 by the sea in the chamber is in it 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.540
 is grain grain broken and by 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.400
 then you have this grain breaking effect 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.100
 a very nice cubic scoren 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.880
 high quality material and gets the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.880
 best value added 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.100
 So the hydraulic gap adjustment 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.260
 is a very important point because 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.580
 Of course , the burglars wear too 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.680
 the wear part and then you have to 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.270
 in gap so regulate that you 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.170
 always the desired end product behind 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.370
 get out 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.440
 here is this during operation 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.230
 possible that is the operator can 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.660
 during the process the product exactly 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.430
 so we want to control it and not 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.710
 just in case that there any 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.780
 metal piece sometimes wanders through but opens 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.940
 the hydraulics and leaves the foreign body 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.860
 the probability of that happen 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.970
 you get a loss on the level is 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.970
 so very low 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.130
 Not 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.900
