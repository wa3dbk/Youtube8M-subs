feedback and Lawrence innovation we

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.140 
feedback and Lawrence innovation we
develop<00:00:51.740> structure<00:00:52.160> map<00:00:52.340> because<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> lot<00:00:53.090> of

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
develop structure map because a lot of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.880 
develop structure map because a lot of
the<00:00:53.210> early<00:00:53.450> adopters<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.170> structures<00:00:54.680> and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
the early adopters of structures and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.590 
the early adopters of structures and
we're<00:00:55.220> having<00:00:55.400> difficulty<00:00:55.970> interpreting<00:00:56.270> it

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
we're having difficulty interpreting it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200 
we're having difficulty interpreting it
so<00:00:57.290> overlaying<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.280> structure<00:00:58.640> information

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
so overlaying the structure information

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.450 
so overlaying the structure information
on<00:00:59.390> top<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.750> chart<00:01:00.050> allows<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.250> better

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
on top of the chart allows you to better

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.490 
on top of the chart allows you to better
see<00:01:01.820> where<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.300> structure<00:01:02.750> is<00:01:02.900> positioned

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
see where that structure is positioned

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.070 
see where that structure is positioned
in<00:01:03.590> relation<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:04.070> your<00:01:04.580> vessel<00:01:04.940> another<00:01:05.900> nice

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080

feature<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.620> hds<00:01:07.040> gen2<00:01:07.280> product<00:01:07.910> is<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.090> much

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
feature the hds gen2 product is a much

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.570 
feature the hds gen2 product is a much
faster<00:01:08.630> processor<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.860> makes<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.250> entire

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
faster processor it makes the entire

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.550 
faster processor it makes the entire
experience<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.390> using<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.750> MFD<00:01:12.110> on<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.380> water

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
experience of using the MFD on the water

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.770 
experience of using the MFD on the water
so<00:01:12.950> much<00:01:13.160> easier

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.570 

this<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.409> got<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:20.950> tell<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.220> something

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
this is I got to tell you something

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.980 
this is I got to tell you something
though<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.090> so<00:01:22.330> unique

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
though this is so unique

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.890 
though this is so unique
because<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.909> I'm<00:01:25.060> seeing<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.690> know<00:01:25.780> this

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
because what I'm seeing you know this

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.600 
because what I'm seeing you know this
first<00:01:26.229> time<00:01:26.530> seeing<00:01:26.800> this<00:01:26.979> thing<00:01:27.220> what<00:01:27.460> I'm

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
first time seeing this thing what I'm

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.200 
first time seeing this thing what I'm
seeing<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.330> how<00:01:28.960> much<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:30.070> structure<00:01:30.670> follows

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
seeing is how much the structure follows

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.200 
seeing is how much the structure follows
the<00:01:31.390> contours<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.590> I've<00:01:32.770> never<00:01:33.159> seen<00:01:33.490> before

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
the contours that I've never seen before

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.969 
the contours that I've never seen before
yeah<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.390> mean<00:01:34.720> just<00:01:34.930> you<00:01:35.409> know<00:01:35.530> never<00:01:35.770> even

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
yeah I mean just you know never even

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.770 
yeah I mean just you know never even
been<00:01:36.190> able<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.490> pick<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.940> out<00:01:37.000> before<00:01:37.420> you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
been able to pick that out before you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.690 
been able to pick that out before you
just<00:01:37.930> know<00:01:38.140> there's<00:01:38.409> something<00:01:38.470> there<00:01:38.920> but

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
just know there's something there but

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.270 
just know there's something there but
you<00:01:39.850> don't<00:01:40.030> realize<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.409> vane<00:01:41.740> follows

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
you don't realize that this vane follows

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.460 
you don't realize that this vane follows
this<00:01:42.460> contour<00:01:43.300> line<00:01:43.450> or<00:01:43.659> this<00:01:43.840> follows<00:01:44.320> it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
this contour line or this follows it

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.249 
this contour line or this follows it
it's<00:01:44.619> really<00:01:45.130> unique<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.540> awesome<00:01:47.080> I

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
it's really unique this is awesome I

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.040 
it's really unique this is awesome I
mean<00:01:47.860> just<00:01:48.250> being<00:01:48.399> able<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.759> see<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.780> know<00:01:49.810> the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
mean just being able to see you know the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.109 
mean just being able to see you know the
the<00:01:50.350> high<00:01:50.860> spot<00:01:51.220> here<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.640> course<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.910> can<00:01:52.030> see

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
the high spot here of course you can see

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.609 
the high spot here of course you can see
that's<00:01:52.240> getting<00:01:52.570> shallower<00:01:52.960> right<00:01:53.229> there<00:01:53.470> and

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
that's getting shallower right there and

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.620 
that's getting shallower right there and
rocks<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.100> both<00:01:54.310> sides<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:54.880> look<00:01:55.330> at<00:01:55.479> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
rocks on both sides and look at the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.630 
rocks on both sides and look at the
different<00:01:56.259> levels<00:01:56.380> they're<00:01:56.710> almost<00:01:56.860> exactly

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
different levels they're almost exactly

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.370 
different levels they're almost exactly
following<00:01:58.000> your<00:01:58.539> contour<00:01:58.990> lines<00:01:59.140> that's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
following your contour lines that's

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.080 
following your contour lines that's
that's<00:01:59.770> incredible<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.369> mean<00:02:00.399> this<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.759> spot

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
that's incredible I mean this is a spot

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.580 
that's incredible I mean this is a spot
right<00:02:01.330> here<00:02:01.390> where<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.750> pinches<00:02:02.050> down<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.259> go

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
right here where it pinches down I go

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.440 
right here where it pinches down I go
yeah<00:02:02.830> I<00:02:02.860> want<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.190> fish<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.520> now<00:02:04.179> can<00:02:04.360> we

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
yeah I want to fish that now can we

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.080 
yeah I want to fish that now can we
track<00:02:04.780> back<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:05.130> Waypoint<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:07.000> know

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
track back in Waypoint it like you know

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.219 
track back in Waypoint it like you know
like<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.330> used<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.539> do<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:07.690> structure<00:02:08.050> stream

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
like we used to do a structure stream

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.100 
like we used to do a structure stream
absolutely<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.039> can<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:10.479> very<00:02:10.509> simple<00:02:10.929> just

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
absolutely you can it's very simple just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
absolutely you can it's very simple just
activate<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.560> cursor<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.100> chart

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
activate your cursor on the chart

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.759 
activate your cursor on the chart
position<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.510> where<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.780> want<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.050> hit<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
position it where you want it hit the

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.720 
position it where you want it hit the
Enter<00:02:15.100> key<00:02:15.130> once

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
Enter key once

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.080 
Enter key once
that's<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> waypoint<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.470> you're<00:02:17.590> good<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.800> go

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that's a waypoint and you're good to go

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.059 
that's a waypoint and you're good to go
so<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.209> just<00:02:19.330> every<00:02:20.260> all<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.709> features<00:02:21.040> that

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
so it's just every all the features that

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.380 
so it's just every all the features that
we<00:02:21.310> used<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.819> are<00:02:21.970> still<00:02:22.180> there

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
we used to have are still there

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
we used to have are still there
absolutely<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.290> didn't<00:02:23.500> take<00:02:23.590> anything<00:02:23.860> away

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
absolutely we didn't take anything away

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.610 
absolutely we didn't take anything away
and<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.700> add<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.000> added<00:02:25.570> added<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.079> this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
and just add it added added this this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.890 
and just add it added added this this
ability<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:28.000> things<00:02:28.570> from<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.780> different

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
ability to see things from a different

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.289 
ability to see things from a different
perspective<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:29.860> top<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.340> chart<00:02:30.579> it's<00:02:30.910> I

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
perspective on top of the chart it's I

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.180 
perspective on top of the chart it's I
just<00:02:31.900> can't<00:02:32.320> believe<00:02:32.410> how<00:02:32.650> much<00:02:32.799> difference

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
just can't believe how much difference

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.400 
just can't believe how much difference
it<00:02:33.310> makes<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.760> mean<00:02:34.060> that's<00:02:34.239> that's<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
it makes I mean that's that's the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.900 
it makes I mean that's that's the
biggest<00:02:35.769> thing<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.130> I've<00:02:36.370> noticed<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
biggest thing that I've noticed is that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.930 
biggest thing that I've noticed is that
how<00:02:37.810> easy<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.560> interpret<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.250> how<00:02:39.790> all

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
how easy it is to interpret and how all

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.520 
how easy it is to interpret and how all
of<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.090> sudden<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.360> puts<00:02:40.630> everything<00:02:41.110> in

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
of a sudden it puts everything in

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.170 
of a sudden it puts everything in
perspective<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.130> where<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.430> understand<00:02:42.970> it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
perspective to where you understand it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.699 
perspective to where you understand it
very<00:02:43.540> very<00:02:43.690> simple<00:02:44.110> exactly

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.559 

one<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.610> greatest<00:02:47.849> things<00:02:48.180> about<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
one of the greatest things about the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.800 
one of the greatest things about the
generation<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.260> HDS<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.209> don't<00:02:51.450> lose

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
generation to HDS is that you don't lose

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.780 
generation to HDS is that you don't lose
anything<00:02:52.200> from<00:02:52.530> generation<00:02:53.040> 1<00:02:53.220> meaning<00:02:53.640> all

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
anything from generation 1 meaning all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.819 
anything from generation 1 meaning all
the<00:02:53.849> same<00:02:54.329> features<00:02:54.689> you<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:55.079> you<00:02:55.319> have<00:02:55.620> on

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
the same features you have you have on

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.649 
the same features you have you have on
the<00:02:55.920> generation<00:02:56.250> 2<00:02:56.579> one<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> my<00:02:57.269> favorite

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
the generation 2 one of my favorite

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.960 
the generation 2 one of my favorite
things<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.079> full<00:02:58.379> panel<00:02:58.739> screen<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.700> if<00:02:59.819> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
things is the full panel screen so if I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.490 
things is the full panel screen so if I
hit<00:03:00.180> my<00:03:00.329> pages<00:03:00.750> button<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.379> already

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
hit my pages button here and I already

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.099 
hit my pages button here and I already
have<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.860> preset<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.700> go<00:03:03.359> to<00:03:03.420> my<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.900> see

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
have it preset I go to my and you see

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.869 
have it preset I go to my and you see
how<00:03:04.290> fast<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> process<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.670> thing

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
how fast the process is be this thing

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.559 
how fast the process is be this thing
goes<00:03:06.290> micro<00:03:07.290> fast<00:03:07.560> just<00:03:07.819> instantly<00:03:08.819> but<00:03:09.390> you

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
goes micro fast just instantly but you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.899 
goes micro fast just instantly but you
can<00:03:09.689> see<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.079> have<00:03:10.379> all<00:03:10.560> my<00:03:10.769> screens<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.400> have

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
can see now I have all my screens I have

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.449 
can see now I have all my screens I have
my<00:03:12.120> my<00:03:12.599> structure<00:03:12.900> scan<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.709> my<00:03:13.859> down<00:03:14.099> scan

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
my my structure scan I have my down scan

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.780 
my my structure scan I have my down scan
imaging<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.480> my<00:03:15.629> sonar<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.579> my

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
imaging I have my sonar and I have my

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.690 
imaging I have my sonar and I have my
mapping<00:03:18.120> with<00:03:19.109> my<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:19.859> it's<00:03:20.010> called<00:03:20.220> structure

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
mapping with my so it's called structure

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.280 
mapping with my so it's called structure
map<00:03:20.879> now<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.329> have<00:03:21.540> my<00:03:21.659> mapping<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.139> my

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
map now I have my mapping with my

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.899 
map now I have my mapping with my
structure<00:03:22.650> overlay<00:03:23.040> how<00:03:23.370> cool<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.879> that

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
structure overlay how cool is that

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.149 
structure overlay how cool is that
because<00:03:24.420> now<00:03:24.629> I<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.379> take<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:25.769> this

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
because now I can take all this

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.670 
because now I can take all this
information<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.879> put<00:03:27.629> it<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.139> map<00:03:28.379> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
information and put it on the map and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.899 
information and put it on the map and
know<00:03:29.280> exactly<00:03:30.470> what<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.129> it's<00:03:32.639> so

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
know exactly what I have and it's so

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.449 
know exactly what I have and it's so
simple<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.540> interpret<00:03:34.049> because<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.980> gives<00:03:35.280> you

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
simple to interpret because it gives you

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.910 
simple to interpret because it gives you
the<00:03:35.609> contour<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.629> see<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.709> here

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
the contour so you can see you know here

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920 
the contour so you can see you know here
I'm<00:03:38.040> coming<00:03:38.280> up<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.639> creek<00:03:38.939> channel<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
I'm coming up to a creek channel and I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.960 
I'm coming up to a creek channel and I
can<00:03:40.139> see<00:03:40.379> where<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.950> rocks<00:03:41.189> are<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.579> relation

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
can see where the rocks are in relation

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.099 
can see where the rocks are in relation
to<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.180> channel<00:03:42.540> where<00:03:42.750> they<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:42.989> in

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
to the channel where they are in

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.229 
to the channel where they are in
relation<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.739> drop-off<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.879> makes

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
relation to the drop-off it makes

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.670 
relation to the drop-off it makes
everything<00:03:45.599> so<00:03:46.109> simple

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
everything so simple

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:58.120 
everything so simple
that's<00:03:47.400> structure<00:03:47.970> map
