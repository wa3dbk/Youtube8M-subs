00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
should be going through when you are

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
to do will be based upon the resources

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.740 
to do will be based upon the resources
that<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.510> have<00:00:59.540> and<00:01:00.020> not<00:01:00.320> necessarily<00:01:01.160> upon
