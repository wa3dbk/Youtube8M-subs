00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.300 
vehicle would we have very limited space
on<00:03:41.930> some<00:03:42.139> of<00:03:42.230> these<00:03:42.290> freeways<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.950> therefore

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
on some of these freeways and therefore

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.580 
on some of these freeways and therefore
we're<00:03:44.060> able<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.359> split<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.810> between<00:03:44.840> traffic

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
we're able to split in between traffic

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.860 
we're able to split in between traffic
and<00:03:45.769> get<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.549> scene<00:03:46.790> clear<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.329> lanes<00:03:47.569> and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and get to the scene clear the lanes and

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.379 
and get to the scene clear the lanes and
get<00:03:48.230> traffic<00:03:48.620> flowing<00:03:48.859> once<00:03:49.100> again<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.670> so

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
get traffic flowing once again and so

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.470 
get traffic flowing once again and so
this<00:03:51.049> motorcycle<00:03:51.579> allows<00:03:52.579> us<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:52.970> do<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.299> it

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
this motorcycle allows us to do that it

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.050 
this motorcycle allows us to do that it
allows<00:03:53.720> us<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:54.079> carry<00:03:54.350> our<00:03:54.819> most<00:03:55.819> needed

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
allows us to carry our most needed

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.470 
allows us to carry our most needed
equipment<00:03:56.329> in<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.750> saddlebags<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:58.670> it's

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
equipment in the saddlebags and and it's

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.059 
equipment in the saddlebags and and it's
really<00:03:59.569> ideal<00:03:59.900> for<00:04:00.380> what<00:04:00.500> we're<00:04:00.650> doing<00:04:00.889> here

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
really ideal for what we're doing here

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.039 
really ideal for what we're doing here
in<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.190> city<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:02.060> process<00:04:02.450> by<00:04:02.600> which<00:04:02.630> we

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
in the city the process by which we

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.289 
in the city the process by which we
choose<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.470> motorcycle<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.310> we<00:04:04.850> utilize

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
choose the motorcycle that we we utilize

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.039 
choose the motorcycle that we we utilize
is<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:06.319> quite<00:04:06.560> extensive<00:04:06.889> so<00:04:07.670> for<00:04:08.600> example

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
is it's quite extensive so for example

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.449 
is it's quite extensive so for example
this<00:04:09.170> motorcycle<00:04:09.739> behind<00:04:09.889> me<00:04:10.130> had<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.310> go

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
this motorcycle behind me had to go

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.660 
this motorcycle behind me had to go
through<00:04:10.639> several<00:04:10.819> tests<00:04:11.239> some<00:04:12.139> of<00:04:12.290> which

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
through several tests some of which

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.879 
through several tests some of which
include<00:04:13.670> braking<00:04:14.230> collision<00:04:15.230> avoidance<00:04:15.650> it

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
include braking collision avoidance it

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.520 
include braking collision avoidance it
can<00:04:16.459> complete<00:04:16.729> include<00:04:17.090> high<00:04:17.329> speed<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
can complete include high speed and a

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.710 
can complete include high speed and a
turning<00:04:18.859> radius<00:04:18.909> the<00:04:19.909> motorcycle<00:04:20.479> must<00:04:20.630> be

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
turning radius the motorcycle must be

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.980 
turning radius the motorcycle must be
able<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.109> turn<00:04:21.349> a<00:04:21.590> 360<00:04:22.460> 60<00:04:23.000> degrees<00:04:23.330> within<00:04:23.539> 18

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
able to turn a 360 60 degrees within 18

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.089 
feet
it<00:04:25.099> also<00:04:25.280> should<00:04:25.669> sustained<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.330> top<00:04:26.659> speed

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
it also should sustained a top speed

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.740 
it also should sustained a top speed
full<00:04:28.099> throttle<00:04:28.130> wide<00:04:28.700> open<00:04:28.729> for<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> minimum<00:04:29.599> of

full throttle wide open for a minimum of
5<00:04:30.020> miles<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.789> so<00:04:31.789> if<00:04:32.120> we<00:04:32.419> if<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.960> motorcycle

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
5 miles and so if we if the motorcycle

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.690 
5 miles and so if we if the motorcycle
can<00:04:34.909> do<00:04:35.270> these<00:04:35.630> things<00:04:36.039> that<00:04:37.039> we<00:04:37.250> asked<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.580> to

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
can do these things that we asked it to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.020 
can do these things that we asked it to
do<00:04:37.849> it<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.270> eligible<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:39.099> to<00:04:40.099> be<00:04:40.250> written<00:04:40.760> as<00:04:41.000> a
