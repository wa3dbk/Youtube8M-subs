00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
yeah the beginning part there was a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.060 
yeah the beginning part there was a
little<00:00:51.309> bit<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.579> an<00:00:51.670> exaggeration<00:00:52.210> but<00:00:53.070> star

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
little bit of an exaggeration but star

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.590 
little bit of an exaggeration but star
strings<00:00:54.340> actually<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.059> other<00:00:55.239> they<00:00:55.420> get

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
strings actually the other they get

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.490 
strings actually the other they get
harder<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.350> keep<00:00:56.500> in<00:00:56.649> tune<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:58.360> anyway<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:59.079> had

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
harder to keep in tune but anyway I had

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.759 
harder to keep in tune but anyway I had
an<00:00:59.590> ideas<00:00:59.949> been<00:01:00.280> floating<00:01:00.610> around<00:01:00.640> in<00:01:00.850> my<00:01:00.940> head

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
an ideas been floating around in my head

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:09.050 
an ideas been floating around in my head
I'm<00:01:02.769> using<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.280> guitar<00:01:03.399> string<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:04.989> snare<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.160 

thought<00:01:10.060> I'd<00:01:10.180> come<00:01:10.210> out<00:01:10.390> here<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.810> give<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.110> a

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
thought I'd come out here and give it a

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.540 
thought I'd come out here and give it a
shot<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:12.610> if<00:01:12.640> it'll<00:01:12.850> work<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.680> set<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.100> up<00:01:15.250> and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
shot see if it'll work and set it up and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
shot see if it'll work and set it up and
we'll<00:01:16.540> check<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.899> out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.540 

well<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.590> reason<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:14.980> thought<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.430> be

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
well so the reason I thought it would be

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.690 
well so the reason I thought it would be
a<00:02:15.580> good<00:02:15.820> idea<00:02:16.590> go<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.860> Warren<00:02:18.040> guitar<00:02:18.460> strings

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
a good idea go for Warren guitar strings

are<00:02:18.820> pre<00:02:19.060> light<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.510> compact<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.440> don't

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
are pre light and compact they don't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.460 
are pre light and compact they don't
take<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.800> lot<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.100> room<00:02:21.720> they've<00:02:22.720> also<00:02:22.900> got<00:02:23.260> this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
for snow water the main reason I thought

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880 
for snow water the main reason I thought
of<00:03:38.570> guitar<00:03:38.840> strings<00:03:38.870> because<00:03:39.410> when<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.620> change

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
of guitar strings because when I change

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.350 
of guitar strings because when I change
them<00:03:39.980> I've<00:03:40.160> got<00:03:40.310> six<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.730> these<00:03:40.820> laying<00:03:41.240> around

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
them I've got six of these laying around

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.150 
them I've got six of these laying around
that<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.810> usually<00:03:41.930> throw<00:03:42.200> in<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.380> trash<00:03:45.160> but

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
that I usually throw in the trash but

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.500 
that I usually throw in the trash but
they're<00:03:46.310> not<00:03:46.430> hard<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.700> come<00:03:46.970> by<00:03:47.180> they're

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
they're not hard to come by they're

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.590 
they're not hard to come by they're
pretty<00:03:47.720> compact<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.850> see<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.450> could

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
pretty compact and see you could

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.880 
pretty compact and see you could
probably<00:03:50.750> pick<00:03:50.960> ten<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.290> these<00:03:51.350> into<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.680> little

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
probably pick ten of these into a little

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.790 
probably pick ten of these into a little
container<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.660> can<00:03:53.660> go<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.960> music<00:03:54.260> store<00:03:54.350> and

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
container I can go to a music store and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.350 
container I can go to a music store and
get<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:54.950> cheap<00:03:55.160> pack<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.550> strings<00:03:55.820> for<00:03:56.030> probably

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
get a cheap pack of strings for probably

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
get a cheap pack of strings for probably
three<00:03:56.480> or<00:03:56.570> four<00:03:56.780> dollars<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:59.110> they<00:04:00.110> seem<00:04:00.350> to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
three or four dollars and they seem to

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.960 
three or four dollars and they seem to
be<00:04:00.500> fairly<00:04:00.830> effective<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:04.160> anyway<00:04:04.310> leave<00:04:04.940> a
