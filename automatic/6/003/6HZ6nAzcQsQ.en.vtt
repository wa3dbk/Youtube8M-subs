it<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.980> features

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it just has to do with what features

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.470 
it just has to do with what features
each<00:00:41.790> one<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> cameras<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> then

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
each one of the cameras have and then

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.209 
each one of the cameras have and then
from<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> ep-3<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.770> bigger<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
from the ep-3 is a little bit bigger and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180 
from the ep-3 is a little bit bigger and
the<00:00:47.850> EPL<00:00:48.360> three<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> EPM<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the EPL three and then the EPM one is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.029 
the EPL three and then the EPM one is
the<00:00:50.280> smallest<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> bunch<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:52.010> take<00:00:53.010> a

you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> lot<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> stuff<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.140> saw<00:01:46.290> with

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you know a lot of the stuff we saw with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.420 
you know a lot of the stuff we saw with
the<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.220> ep-3<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.159> with

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the the ep-3 this the what they do with

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.210 
the the ep-3 this the what they do with
this<00:01:50.520> body<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.860> little<00:01:53.100> bit

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
this body is that it's a little bit

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.649 
this body is that it's a little bit
slimmer<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.700> don't<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> ep-3<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.509> show

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
slimmer I don't have the ep-3 to show

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
slimmer I don't have the ep-3 to show
you<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> body<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.829> little<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.219> slimmer

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you but the body is a little bit slimmer

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.160 
you but the body is a little bit slimmer
a<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:57.030> smaller<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.770> then<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.159> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
a little smaller and then you have the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.420 
a little smaller and then you have the
the<00:02:01.170> LCD<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.880> tilt<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.450> pop<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.649> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the LCD it can tilt it pop out so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.180 
the LCD it can tilt it pop out so
obviously<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.780> standard<00:02:07.530> position

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
obviously that's the standard position

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.980 
obviously that's the standard position
you<00:02:08.910> could<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.390> down<00:02:10.370> up<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you could go out down up to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.560 
you could go out down up to
about<00:02:13.440> 90<00:02:13.890> degrees<00:02:14.750> out<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
about 90 degrees out like this and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.350 
about 90 degrees out like this and
that's<00:02:18.570> about<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:20.220> doesn't<00:02:20.430> go<00:02:21.150> out

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
that's about it it it doesn't go out

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.110 
that's about it it it doesn't go out

through 42 millimeter kit lens that

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.290 
through 42 millimeter kit lens that
we've<00:03:19.890> seen<00:03:20.100> before<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.910> newest

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
we've seen before it's the newest

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.180 
we've seen before it's the newest
variety<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:22.770> like<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.430> would<00:03:23.550> get<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
variety just like you would get on the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.350 
variety just like you would get on the
on<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> EPA<00:03:26.900> EP<00:03:27.900> 3<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.820> these<00:03:30.030> names<00:03:30.210> are

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
on the EPA EP 3 is that these names are

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.500 
on the EPA EP 3 is that these names are
really<00:03:30.480> confusing<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.490> said<00:03:32.700> get<00:03:33.090> fancy

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
really confusing like I said get fancy

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.010 
really confusing like I said get fancy
art<00:03:33.660> centers<00:03:34.050> sensors<00:03:34.880> just<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.360> fancy<00:03:36.600> art

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
art centers sensors just the fancy art

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.620 
art centers sensors just the fancy art
filters<00:03:37.710> and<00:03:37.970> then<00:03:38.970> uh<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:40.640> think<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:42.330> about

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
filters and then uh I think that about

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.870 
filters and then uh I think that about
covers<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.350> in<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.710> lot<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.950> other<00:03:44.130> new<00:03:44.550> things

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
covers it in a lot of other new things

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.180 
covers it in a lot of other new things
but<00:03:45.120> let's<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:45.840> focus<00:03:46.050> on<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.440> hardware<00:03:46.860> and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
but let's just focus on the hardware and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.580 
but let's just focus on the hardware and
what<00:03:47.490> this<00:03:47.670> thing<00:03:47.880> looks<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.960> a<00:03:49.170> it's

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
what this thing looks like is a it's

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.590 
what this thing looks like is a it's
definitely<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.950> handsome<00:03:50.250> camera<00:03:50.610> it's<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.390> nice

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
definitely a handsome camera it's a nice

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.000 
definitely a handsome camera it's a nice
size<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:54.570> then<00:03:54.720> if<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.930> get<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.230> some<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.890> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
size so then if you get the some of the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.000 
size so then if you get the some of the
smaller<00:03:56.250> lenses<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.760> 17<00:03:57.180> millimeter<00:03:57.540> set<00:03:58.010> you

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
smaller lenses the 17 millimeter set you

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.690 
smaller lenses the 17 millimeter set you
can<00:03:59.130> get<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.580> really<00:04:00.240> trimmed<00:04:00.660> down<00:04:00.980> camera

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.980 

anyway<00:04:05.700> yeah<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.300> just<00:04:06.450> want<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.690> do<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> quick

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
anyway yeah I just want to do a quick

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.330 
anyway yeah I just want to do a quick
look<00:04:07.200> at<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.530> don't<00:04:07.680> really<00:04:07.830> played<00:04:08.070> with<00:04:08.220> it

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
look at it I don't really played with it

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.670 
look at it I don't really played with it
just<00:04:08.520> got<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.030> few<00:04:09.210> days<00:04:09.300> ago<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:10.410> is

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
just got it in a few days ago this is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.610 
just got it in a few days ago this is
the<00:04:11.090> olympus<00:04:12.090> pen<00:04:12.530> ep-1<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:18.900> think<00:04:19.170> people<00:04:19.440> like

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
the olympus pen ep-1 I think people like

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.650 
the olympus pen ep-1 I think people like
it<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.220> little<00:04:20.430> bit<00:04:20.520> cheaper<00:04:20.730> than

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
it and it's a little bit cheaper than

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.330 
it and it's a little bit cheaper than
some<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.530> other<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:22.890> some<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
some of the other but some of the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.670 
some of the other but some of the
depends<00:04:24.120> have<00:04:24.300> been<00:04:24.480> in<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.630> past<00:04:27.500> it's<00:04:28.500> hard

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
depends have been in the past it's hard

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.860 
depends have been in the past it's hard
to<00:04:28.770> tell<00:04:28.890> just<00:04:28.950> how<00:04:29.130> fast<00:04:29.430> this<00:04:29.580> thing<00:04:29.640> is<00:04:31.280> but

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.630 

it's<00:04:36.320> very<00:04:36.500> little<00:04:36.710> delay<00:04:36.950> on<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.280> autofocus

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
it's very little delay on the autofocus

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:51.300 
it's very little delay on the autofocus
there

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.969 

yeah<00:04:52.340> builder<00:04:53.210> can<00:04:53.300> camera<00:04:53.629> tilt<00:04:54.560> uh<00:04:54.650> send<00:04:54.860> out

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
yeah builder can camera tilt uh send out
