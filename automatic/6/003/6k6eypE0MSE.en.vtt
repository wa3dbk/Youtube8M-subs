00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.210 
try to blend it in with the wig I would
say<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.899> week<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> hard<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.070> your

natural<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.939> had<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:43.049> bit<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.350> hard

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
natural I had a little bit of a hard

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.109 
natural I had a little bit of a hard
time<00:01:43.590> blending<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.340> way<00:01:44.490> than<00:01:44.789> I<00:01:44.880> would

with<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.539> different<00:01:45.979> type<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.130> wave<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
with a different type of wave so this is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990 
with a different type of wave so this is
probably<00:01:48.360> better<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.720> relaxed<00:01:49.439> hair<00:01:50.000> sorry

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
probably better for relaxed hair sorry

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
probably better for relaxed hair sorry
but<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.020> can't<00:01:52.229> work<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.770> work<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
but if you can't work it you can work it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.219 
but if you can't work it you can work it
you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.700> always<00:01:53.850> try<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.119> put<00:01:54.450> some<00:01:54.630> hair<00:01:54.840> over

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
you can always try to put some hair over

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.609 
you can always try to put some hair over
the<00:01:56.130> front<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.720> know<00:01:57.750> hide<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the front to kind of you know hide the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.109 
the front to kind of you know hide the
hair<00:01:58.830> that's<00:01:59.459> what<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> do

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
hair that's what I do

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.809 
hair that's what I do
because<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:01.170> does<00:02:01.319> have<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.560> layers<00:02:01.920> right

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
because it does have the layers right

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.260 
because it does have the layers right
here<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.909> then<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.179> way

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
here right here and then all the way
