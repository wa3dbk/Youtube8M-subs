00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.250
 on the fifth fret 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.030
 there will be a 5 string in the eighth year 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.240
 5 string on the fifth fret 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 6 cm on the sixth fret 4 hours ago 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.660
 when comes 4 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.480
 this is the vedic string on the sixth year 5 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.770
 string on the fifth fret 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:19.040
 in the eighth year it became 7 water 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.040
 6 by 8 6 by 5 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.230
 people 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.770
 this 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.370
 we draw 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.229
 then we will have four phrases 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.229
 we played with you 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.879
 and again we start to screw 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.040
 Quint of 6 strings and then we start 6 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.370
 fret down sixth fret 5 3 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.370
 stand 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.000
 on the fifth fret, we game rally 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.640
 I cannot consist of muffled 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.800
 beats on one sixth string one 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.949
 hitting down open 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.379
 immediately 6 of 6 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.889
 here two times two times 6 again and 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.580
 good worth 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.710
 to breed 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.370
 I do not recommend counting right away 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.370
 to remember the rhythm 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:39.530
 the gift of the obvious chain means fluffy two 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.530

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:49.690
 further we repeat covered from 6 1 6 here 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.690
 5 3 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.060
 these besides retro 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.060

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.990

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:19.130

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.490
 4 8 3 10 3 9 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.729
 37 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.860
 four 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.060

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.629

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.080
 one 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.730

 3 weeks of the tenth ninth season here 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.590
 the masses will stop 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.890
 7 frets of 3 jet without releasing the gas 1 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.890
 fingers 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.580
