don't like about the cooler I'm not too
keen<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.100> this<00:04:03.400> foam<00:04:03.670> gasket<00:04:04.360> now<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:06.130> works<00:04:06.430> it

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
keen on this foam gasket now it works it

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.600 
keen on this foam gasket now it works it
does<00:04:07.030> keep<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.600> watertight<00:04:08.020> airtight<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:09.550> a

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
does keep it a watertight airtight but a

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.640 
does keep it a watertight airtight but a
durability<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:10.540> think<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.080> would<00:04:11.200> like<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.440> see<00:04:11.620> a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
durability I think I would like to see a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.330 
durability I think I would like to see a
rubber<00:04:12.190> gasket<00:04:12.490> in<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.030> future<00:04:14.130> as<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.250> can

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
rubber gasket in the future as you can

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.400 
rubber gasket in the future as you can
see<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:16.510> know<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.660> close<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.049> lid<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.260> can

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
see you know to close the lid you can

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.740 
see you know to close the lid you can
definitely<00:04:17.859> see<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:19.000> compression<00:04:19.570> down

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
definitely see the the compression down

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.330 
definitely see the the compression down
on<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.020> gasket<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.950> when<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.100> put<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
on that gasket and when you put the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.370 
on that gasket and when you put the
latches<00:04:21.700> down<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.510> know<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.690> can<00:04:22.900> feel<00:04:23.110> that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
latches down you know you can feel that

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.940 
latches down you know you can feel that
gasket<00:04:23.620> compression<00:04:25.170> I'm<00:04:26.170> not<00:04:26.380> sure<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:26.770> it's

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
gasket compression I'm not sure if it's

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.340 
gasket compression I'm not sure if it's
better<00:04:27.190> than<00:04:27.430> rubber<00:04:27.640> but<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.960> something<00:04:29.230> I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
better than rubber but just something I

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.040 
better than rubber but just something I
would<00:04:29.530> like<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.830> see<00:04:30.280> myself<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:31.030> little<00:04:31.510> higher

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
would like to see myself a little higher

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.370 
would like to see myself a little higher
quality<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.740> gasket<00:04:34.200> another<00:04:35.200> thing<00:04:35.320> I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
quality of a gasket another thing I

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.869 
quality of a gasket another thing I
don't<00:04:35.470> like<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.310> backlash

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
don't like is the the backlash

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.609 
don't like is the the backlash
on<00:04:37.119> the<00:04:37.209> cooler<00:04:37.830> I'm<00:04:38.830> not<00:04:39.069> too<00:04:40.229> high<00:04:41.229> on<00:04:41.259> these

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:41.619 
on the cooler I'm not too high on these

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:44.129 
on the cooler I'm not too high on these
I<00:04:41.800> don't<00:04:41.979> know<00:04:42.159> how<00:04:43.119> durable<00:04:43.539> they<00:04:43.839> would<00:04:43.990> be

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
I don't know how durable they would be

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.499 
I don't know how durable they would be
with<00:04:44.379> you<00:04:44.529> know<00:04:44.619> slam<00:04:44.949> on<00:04:45.129> the<00:04:45.219> top<00:04:45.429> around<00:04:45.759> but

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
with you know slam on the top around but

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.359 
with you know slam on the top around but
if<00:04:46.599> you<00:04:47.020> do<00:04:47.139> come<00:04:47.379> back<00:04:47.559> unlatch<00:04:48.189> it<00:04:48.219> and<00:04:50.369> if

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:51.369 
if you do come back unlatch it and if

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:54.869 
if you do come back unlatch it and if
you<00:04:51.490> look<00:04:51.610> down<00:04:51.909> you<00:04:52.779> can<00:04:52.809> kind<00:04:53.199> of<00:04:53.319> see<00:04:53.879> you

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
you look down you can kind of see you

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.199 
you look down you can kind of see you
know<00:04:54.909> these<00:04:55.240> are<00:04:55.419> just<00:04:55.949> kind<00:04:56.949> of<00:04:57.039> plastic<00:04:57.699> they

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:58.209 
know these are just kind of plastic they

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.239 
know these are just kind of plastic they
don't<00:04:58.389> seem<00:04:58.689> very<00:04:58.719> sturdy<00:04:59.349> to<00:04:59.559> me<00:04:59.589> knowing

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:00.249 
don't seem very sturdy to me knowing

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:01.829 
don't seem very sturdy to me knowing
that<00:05:00.279> when<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:00.789> lid<00:05:01.029> if<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.539> were<00:05:01.599> just<00:05:01.779> to

let<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.110> drop<00:05:02.379> you<00:05:03.219> know<00:05:03.309> I<00:05:03.339> don't<00:05:03.550> know<00:05:03.610> how

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
let it drop you know I don't know how

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.189 
let it drop you know I don't know how
much<00:05:03.789> where<00:05:04.119> that's<00:05:04.389> putting<00:05:04.659> on<00:05:04.749> so<00:05:04.929> I<00:05:04.990> try

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
much where that's putting on so I try

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.829 
much where that's putting on so I try
and<00:05:05.229> be<00:05:05.379> careful<00:05:05.619> with<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.240> with<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.360> lid<00:05:07.569> and

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:09.429 
not to abuse these things too much

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:12.589 
not to abuse these things too much
because<00:05:09.909> some<00:05:10.899> very<00:05:11.110> small<00:05:11.319> screws<00:05:11.740> lid

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:14.769 
probably the heaviest part of the cooler

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.889 
probably the heaviest part of the cooler
you<00:05:15.339> know<00:05:15.459> and<00:05:15.610> when<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:15.759> come<00:05:15.969> slamming<00:05:16.419> down<00:05:16.599> I

convenient little feature that makes it

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.409 
convenient little feature that makes it
easier<00:05:44.169> to<00:05:44.289> use<00:05:44.409> the<00:05:44.589> cooler<00:05:45.089> I've<00:05:46.089> heard<00:05:46.329> a

how<00:05:55.899> true<00:05:55.959> that<00:05:56.139> is<00:05:56.349> but<00:05:56.499> I<00:05:57.119> would<00:05:58.119> just<00:05:58.240> like

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
how true that is but I would just like

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.969 
how true that is but I would just like
it<00:05:58.569> for<00:05:58.719> the<00:05:58.839> the<00:05:59.139> convenience<00:05:59.379> be<00:05:59.709> able<00:05:59.889> to

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
it for the the convenience be able to

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.209 
it for the the convenience be able to
drain<00:06:00.219> it<00:06:00.369> at<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.610> end<00:06:00.729> of<00:06:00.759> the<00:06:00.849> day<00:06:02.219> but

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
drain it at the end of the day but

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:04.649 
drain it at the end of the day but
that's<00:06:03.369> pretty<00:06:03.490> much<00:06:03.610> it<00:06:03.759> I<00:06:04.089> really<00:06:04.569> don't

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
that's pretty much it I really don't

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:05.790 
that's pretty much it I really don't
have<00:06:04.749> too<00:06:04.930> many<00:06:05.019> complaints<00:06:05.529> about<00:06:05.559> this

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
time I go out and check them out angle
