00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
seen them pass in a capsule formula but

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.700 
seen them pass in a capsule formula but
now<00:00:15.540> they've<00:00:15.750> discontinued<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.650> they

just<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> powdered<00:00:17.580> formula<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.930> formula

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
just have a powdered formula the formula

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.840 
just have a powdered formula the formula
has<00:00:19.560> changed<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.130> jeebies

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
has changed so jeebies

you know what this new product is this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.089 
you know what this new product is this
is<00:00:23.789> their<00:00:24.000> extreme<00:00:24.510> also<00:00:24.869> pump<00:00:25.170> amplifier<00:00:25.800> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
is their extreme also pump amplifier so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.779 
is their extreme also pump amplifier so
it's<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.340> pump<00:00:26.609> product<00:00:27.890> this<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.519> grape

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
it's a pump product this one is in grape

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's a pump product this one is in grape
right<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> only

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
water but if you like so much water do I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.439 
water but if you like so much water do I
have<00:00:50.039> two<00:00:50.160> things<00:00:50.399> they're<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> water

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
have two things they're really the water

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
have two things they're really the water
is<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.960> carrier<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> giving<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.890> body

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
is just a carrier and giving your body

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.830 
is just a carrier and giving your body
more<00:00:53.640> water<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.059> gonna<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.329> less<00:00:54.539> taste

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
more water you're gonna have less taste

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
more water you're gonna have less taste
less<00:00:55.110> water<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.800> tape<00:00:56.010> more<00:00:56.550> taste<00:00:56.760> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
less water get more tape more taste so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.580 
less water get more tape more taste so
really<00:00:57.510> however<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.930> water<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> takes<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
really however much water it takes to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.860 
really however much water it takes to
get<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.859> down<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.340> always<00:00:59.609> needed<00:00:59.910> let's<00:01:00.750> go

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
get this down as always needed let's go

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.599 
get this down as always needed let's go
through<00:01:01.050> through<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> ingredients<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
through through the ingredients this is

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.280 
through through the ingredients this is
not<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> proprietary<00:01:03.539> blend<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.989> tell<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> how

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
much of everything is in there which is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.990

a cell to expand great for pumps the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
a cell to expand great for pumps the
good<00:01:33.900> thing<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.470> hydro<00:01:34.829> max<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
good thing about the hydro max is a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.510 
good thing about the hydro max is a
higher<00:01:35.700> percentage<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.360> glycerol

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
higher percentage of glycerol

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.800 
higher percentage of glycerol
whereas<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> past<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.240> was<00:01:39.299> glycerol

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
whereas in the past there was glycerol

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
whereas in the past there was glycerol

it<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.240> lend<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> pumps<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
it can lend to pumps but really it's

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.880 
it can lend to pumps but really it's
really<00:02:05.280> good<00:02:05.430> endurance<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.630> muscle<00:02:07.200> output

there's an organelle in the so called
the<00:03:07.630> sarcoplasm<00:03:08.260> reticulum<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.340> think<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.790> said

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the sarcoplasm reticulum I think I said

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.350 
the sarcoplasm reticulum I think I said
that<00:03:09.970> right

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
that right

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.600 
that right
and<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:11.260> will<00:03:11.560> hold<00:03:12.370> down<00:03:12.520> the

to<00:03:15.220> release<00:03:15.790> calcium<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.450> cell<00:03:16.690> thus

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
to release calcium in the cell thus

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.670 
to release calcium in the cell thus
enhancing<00:03:18.190> your<00:03:18.640> power<00:03:19.300> or<00:03:19.660> force<00:03:19.930> output<00:03:20.260> and

enhancing your power or force output and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.050 
enhancing your power or force output and
that's<00:03:21.130> what's<00:03:21.370> nice<00:03:21.490> about<00:03:21.550> this<00:03:21.820> ingredient
