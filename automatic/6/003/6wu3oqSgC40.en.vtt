00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
or how do you see it we felt very strong

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429

after<00:00:29.189> picking<00:00:29.369> ban<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.939> felt<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.869> our<00:00:31.109> picks

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
after picking ban I felt like our picks

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.900 
after picking ban I felt like our picks
in<00:00:31.560> general<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.309> strong<00:00:32.610> against

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in general we're really strong against

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.190 
in general we're really strong against
what<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.180> had<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.809> were<00:00:33.960> really

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
what they had so we were really

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
what they had so we were really
confident<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.040> practice<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
confident then we practice a lot of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.940 
confident then we practice a lot of
these<00:00:35.910> matchups<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> predicted

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
these matchups so we kind of predicted

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.860 
these matchups so we kind of predicted
what<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.190> went<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.850> yeah<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.780> pretty

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
