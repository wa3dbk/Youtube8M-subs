Berger<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.519> ultrasound<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.720> it<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.080> how

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
Berger the ultrasound what is it and how

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.500 
Berger the ultrasound what is it and how
does<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> work<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.339> just<00:00:56.820> found<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
does it work I just found is one of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.960 
does it work I just found is one of
these<00:00:57.629> non-invasive<00:00:58.589> remedies<00:00:59.519> that<00:00:59.790> can

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
these non-invasive remedies that can

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.780 
these non-invasive remedies that can
treat<00:01:00.420> certain<00:01:01.229> things<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.920> example<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
treat certain things like for example it

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.119 
treat certain things like for example it
can<00:01:02.940> tighten<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.420> skin<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:04.260> way<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> works<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
can tighten the skin the way it works is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
can tighten the skin the way it works is
we<00:01:05.519> use<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> targeted<00:01:06.390> attack<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
we use a targeted attack on so a kind of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
we use a targeted attack on so a kind of
a<00:01:07.650> shock<00:01:07.979> wave<00:01:08.159> I'd<00:01:08.460> result<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
a shock wave I'd result that first of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
a shock wave I'd result that first of
all<00:01:10.350> destroys<00:01:11.070> fat<00:01:11.430> cells<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.150> fat<00:01:12.479> cell

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
all destroys fat cells so a fat cell

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
all destroys fat cells so a fat cell
that<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.990> exposed<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> address<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that is exposed to address what kind of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
that is exposed to address what kind of
bursts<00:01:14.549> yeah<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.200> at<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> same<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
bursts yeah and at the same time it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.969 
bursts yeah and at the same time it
stimulates<00:01:17.760> collagen<00:01:18.350> every<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.500> injury

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
stimulates collagen every little injury

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.970 
stimulates collagen every little injury
you<00:01:20.159> inflict<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> skin<00:01:21.530> induce<00:01:22.530> collagen

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
you inflict on the skin induce collagen

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.250 
you inflict on the skin induce collagen
production<00:01:23.100> collagen<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.750> matter<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
production collagen is is a matter in

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.870 
production collagen is is a matter in
our<00:01:25.350> skin<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.830> keeps<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.100> skin<00:01:26.340> young<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
our skin that keeps the skin young and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.390 
our skin that keeps the skin young and
healthy<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.660> wrinkle-free<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.980> so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
healthy and and wrinkle-free here so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
healthy and and wrinkle-free here so
anything<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.730> induce<00:01:30.210> collagen<00:01:30.690> induce<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
anything that induce collagen induce a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
anything that induce collagen induce a
some<00:01:32.640> rejuvenation<00:01:33.330> process<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.930> Mexican

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
some rejuvenation process or Mexican

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.010 
some rejuvenation process or Mexican
look<00:01:34.440> better<00:01:34.650> tighter<00:01:35.040> younger<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
look better tighter younger so I have to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590 
look better tighter younger so I have to
ask<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.440> happens<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.010> during<00:01:38.040> an<00:01:38.820> ultrasound

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
ask what happens is during an ultrasound

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
ask what happens is during an ultrasound
procedure<00:01:40.340> there's<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.940> little

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
procedure there's very little

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.110 
procedure there's very little
immediately<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.010> there's<00:01:44.340> no<00:01:44.490> much

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
immediately to see so there's no much

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.760 
immediately to see so there's no much
side<00:01:45.630> effect<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.050> if<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.260> if<00:01:46.470> you're<00:01:46.560> asked

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
side effect so if you if you're asked

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
side effect so if you if you're asked
for<00:01:46.920> example<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.400> patient<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.300> very

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
for example would be patient get very

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
for example would be patient get very
rare<00:01:48.900> about<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.380> skin<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.010> change

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
rare about the skin kind of change

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.760 
rare about the skin kind of change
immediately<00:01:50.660> it<00:01:51.660> does<00:01:51.870> not<00:01:52.080> sure<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.440> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
immediately it does not sure because the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.520 
immediately it does not sure because the
odd<00:01:52.950> result<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.460> targeted<00:01:54.060> into<00:01:54.360> deeper<00:01:54.870> skin

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
odd result is targeted into deeper skin

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.710 
odd result is targeted into deeper skin
structures<00:01:56.040> where<00:01:56.300> actually<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.330> target

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
structures where actually the target

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.420 
structures where actually the target
structure<00:01:57.930> says<00:01:58.230> here<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.530> fibroblast<00:01:59.190> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
structure says here the fibroblast that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.590 
structure says here the fibroblast that
we<00:01:59.820> want<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.620> stimulate<00:02:01.620> in<00:02:01.830> order<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
we want to in stimulate in order to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
we want to in stimulate in order to
produce<00:02:03.600> more<00:02:03.750> collagen<00:02:04.110> or<00:02:04.610> even<00:02:05.610> deeper

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
produce more collagen or even deeper

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
produce more collagen or even deeper
down<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.180> fat<00:02:06.390> cells<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:07.260> are<00:02:07.320> being

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
down the fat cells that are being

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.009 
down the fat cells that are being
destroyed<00:02:08.519> by<00:02:08.580> ultrasound<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.629> there<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.869> not

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
destroyed by ultrasound but there is not

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.619 
destroyed by ultrasound but there is not
much<00:02:10.229> immediate<00:02:10.769> side<00:02:11.459> effects<00:02:11.849> from<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
much immediate side effects from the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.420 
much immediate side effects from the
treatment<00:02:12.989> but<00:02:13.349> having<00:02:13.709> said<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.890> there's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
treatment but having said that there's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.160 
treatment but having said that there's
also<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.819> much<00:02:14.970> immediate<00:02:15.599> effect<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.080> you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
also not much immediate effect so you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.570 
also not much immediate effect so you
need<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.470> repeat<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> treatment<00:02:17.099> several

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
need to repeat the treatment several

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.640 
need to repeat the treatment several
times<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.659> idris<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.349> looking<00:02:19.530> at

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
times and for idris on we are looking at

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.580 
times and for idris on we are looking at
six<00:02:20.220> eight<00:02:20.459> ten<00:02:21.120> sessions<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.750> order<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.409> get<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
six eight ten sessions in order to get a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
six eight ten sessions in order to get a
good<00:02:22.739> result<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.640> he<00:02:23.700> talked<00:02:23.940> about<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
good result so he talked about the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.229 
good result so he talked about the
ultrasound<00:02:25.040> penetrating<00:02:26.040> beyond<00:02:26.969> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
ultrasound penetrating beyond the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
surface and breaking up the fat

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.059 
surface and breaking up the fat
sells<00:02:29.549> over<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.569> five<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> six<00:02:31.530> weeks<00:02:31.709> or

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
sells over this five to six weeks or

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.940 
sells over this five to six weeks or
five<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.730> six<00:02:32.970> sessions<00:02:33.260> what's<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.440> ultimate

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
five to six sessions what's the ultimate

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.020 
five to six sessions what's the ultimate
result<00:02:35.580> depends<00:02:36.330> which<00:02:36.480> area<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:37.140> treat<00:02:37.409> you

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
result depends which area we treat you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.130 
result depends which area we treat you
for<00:02:39.030> example<00:02:39.330> my<00:02:39.480> clinic<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.989> odd

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
for example my clinic with the odd

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720 
for example my clinic with the odd
result<00:02:40.379> machine<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.920> i<00:02:41.099> use<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.610> have

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
result machine that i use we have

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.460 
result machine that i use we have
different<00:02:42.150> hand<00:02:42.540> pieces<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.019> use<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
different hand pieces we use for the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.229 
different hand pieces we use for the
phase<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.459> example<00:02:44.489> treat<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.030> face

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
phase if you for example treat the face

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.180 
phase if you for example treat the face
the<00:02:45.510> patient<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.409> they<00:02:46.500> usually<00:02:46.650> want<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.159> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the patient what they usually want is a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.800 
the patient what they usually want is a
skin<00:02:47.549> tightening<00:02:48.000> effect<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.510> get<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
skin tightening effect so you get this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.160 
skin tightening effect so you get this
through<00:02:49.049> collagen<00:02:49.829> stimulation<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.489> through

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
through collagen stimulation and through

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.660 
through collagen stimulation and through
destruction<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.500> localized<00:02:53.040> head<00:02:53.250> ads<00:02:53.519> here

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
destruction of localized head ads here

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.759 
destruction of localized head ads here
for<00:02:53.940> example<00:02:54.030> yeah<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.319> eventually

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
for example yeah so in it is eventually

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.890 
for example yeah so in it is eventually
the<00:02:56.459> skin<00:02:56.670> looks<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.909> bit<00:02:57.000> tight<00:02:57.239> up<00:02:57.390> patients

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the skin looks a bit tight up patients

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.770 
the skin looks a bit tight up patients
get<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> bit<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.590> kind<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.299> non-surgical<00:03:00.299> lift

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
get a bit a kind of a non-surgical lift

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.069 
get a bit a kind of a non-surgical lift
if<00:03:01.650> its<00:03:01.859> body<00:03:02.129> treatment<00:03:02.609> speech<00:03:02.840> people<00:03:03.840> look

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
if its body treatment speech people look

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.839 
if its body treatment speech people look
more<00:03:04.349> into<00:03:04.680> inch<00:03:05.129> loss<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.760> know

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
more into inch loss you know

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.400 
more into inch loss you know
circumference<00:03:06.510> often<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.989> we<00:03:07.109> can<00:03:07.260> achieve

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
circumference often that we can achieve

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.380 
circumference often that we can achieve
so<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.090> more<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.799> slimming<00:03:10.799> of

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
so so here it's more the slimming of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.449 
so so here it's more the slimming of
certain<00:03:12.390> areas<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.500> achieve<00:03:13.620> so

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
certain areas that we can achieve so

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.940 
certain areas that we can achieve so
this<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.609> ideally<00:03:15.239> for<00:03:15.390> someone<00:03:15.900> who<00:03:16.440> doesn't

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
this is ideally for someone who doesn't

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.949 
this is ideally for someone who doesn't
want<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.220> go<00:03:17.340> under<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.700> knife<00:03:17.730> exactly<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
want to go under the knife exactly it is

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.710 
want to go under the knife exactly it is
for<00:03:19.319> people<00:03:19.590> who<00:03:19.620> doesn't<00:03:20.129> want

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
for people who doesn't want

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.330 
for people who doesn't want
categorically<00:03:21.720> not<00:03:22.319> having<00:03:22.680> surgeries<00:03:23.129> and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
categorically not having surgeries and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.699 
categorically not having surgeries and
then<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.090> also<00:03:24.269> an<00:03:24.569> end<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.140> two<00:03:25.379> surgeries

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
then it's also an end on two surgeries

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.099 
then it's also an end on two surgeries
you<00:03:25.829> often<00:03:26.159> combine<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.700> with<00:03:27.109> with

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
you often combine this with with

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.930 
you often combine this with with
liposuction<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.950> example<00:03:29.250> liposuction<00:03:29.790> can

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
liposuction for example liposuction can

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.990 
liposuction for example liposuction can
only<00:03:30.090> do<00:03:30.269> as<00:03:30.599> much<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.230> then<00:03:31.319> after<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
only do as much and then after the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.849 
only do as much and then after the
actual<00:03:33.000> plastic<00:03:33.269> surgery<00:03:33.660> procedure<00:03:34.139> we

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
actual plastic surgery procedure we

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.039 
actual plastic surgery procedure we
would<00:03:35.040> use<00:03:35.190> agile<00:03:35.459> sound<00:03:35.790> too<00:03:36.180> kind<00:03:36.419> of<00:03:36.510> kind

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
would use agile sound too kind of kind

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.199 
would use agile sound too kind of kind
of<00:03:37.200> fine<00:03:37.560> tune<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.130> researcher<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:39.030> some

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
of fine tune the researcher but some

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.940 
of fine tune the researcher but some
people<00:03:39.450> who<00:03:39.569> do<00:03:39.810> not<00:03:39.840> want<00:03:40.260> surgery<00:03:40.560> they<00:03:40.769> can

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
people who do not want surgery they can

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.220 
people who do not want surgery they can
also<00:03:41.099> undergo<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.849> loose<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.269> procedures<00:03:42.720> but

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
also undergo a loose on procedures but

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.349 
also undergo a loose on procedures but
of<00:03:43.380> course<00:03:43.590> they<00:03:43.709> their<00:03:44.340> expectations<00:03:45.150> needs

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
of course they their expectations needs

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.599 
of course they their expectations needs
to<00:03:45.510> be<00:03:45.629> more<00:03:45.810> realistic<00:03:46.139> in<00:03:46.590> terms<00:03:46.919> of<00:03:47.220> outcome

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
to be more realistic in terms of outcome

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.909 
to be more realistic in terms of outcome
so<00:03:48.000> for<00:03:48.450> our<00:03:48.629> viewers<00:03:49.079> who<00:03:49.319> might<00:03:49.590> want<00:03:49.829> to

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
so for our viewers who might want to

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.009 
so for our viewers who might want to
undertake<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.609> procedure<00:03:51.090> what<00:03:51.780> are<00:03:51.870> some

undertake this procedure what are some

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.720 
undertake this procedure what are some
of<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.169> characteristics<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:53.310> really<00:03:53.579> good

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
of the characteristics of really good

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.300 
of the characteristics of really good
machines<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.440> can<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.590> very<00:03:55.739> effective<00:03:55.859> for

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
machines that can be very effective for

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.009 
machines that can be very effective for
them<00:03:56.430> bottom<00:03:56.879> line<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.450> should<00:03:57.480> treat<00:03:57.780> all

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
them bottom line you should treat all

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.539 
them bottom line you should treat all
body<00:03:58.230> areas<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.889> should<00:03:59.040> be<00:03:59.129> able<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.430> treat

body areas you should be able to treat

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.009 
body areas you should be able to treat
all<00:03:59.730> body<00:03:59.940> areas<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.480> should<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.780> course<00:04:00.959> be

all body areas it should of course be

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.939 
all body areas it should of course be
effective<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:02.069> should<00:04:02.280> be<00:04:02.310> licensed<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.269> so

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
effective it should be licensed and so

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.890 
effective it should be licensed and so
best<00:04:04.949> is<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.129> have<00:04:05.340> an<00:04:05.459> FDA<00:04:05.790> approval<00:04:06.449> which

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
best is to have an FDA approval which

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.680 
best is to have an FDA approval which

which proved safety and efficacy yeah

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.390 
which proved safety and efficacy yeah
and<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.530> course<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.889> should<00:04:11.010> not<00:04:11.129> be<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
