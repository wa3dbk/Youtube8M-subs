pretty simple I want you to take a

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.300 
pretty simple I want you to take a
design<00:00:19.720> from<00:00:20.230> elements<00:00:21.100> sketchbook<00:00:23.160> which<00:00:24.160> is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
design from elements sketchbook which is

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.550 
design from elements sketchbook which is
pretty<00:00:24.610> pretty<00:00:25.390> easily<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:25.990> some<00:00:26.140> tracing

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
pretty pretty easily and some tracing

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.970 
pretty pretty easily and some tracing
paper<00:00:28.140> basically<00:00:29.140> what<00:00:29.439> I<00:00:29.470> have<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> do<00:00:29.740> is<00:00:29.860> I'm

going<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.130> trace<00:00:30.400> over<00:00:30.580> the<00:00:30.790> design<00:00:31.000> that<00:00:31.150> I

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
going to trace over the design that I

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.819 
going to trace over the design that I
want<00:00:31.450> which<00:00:31.779> would<00:00:31.990> be<00:00:32.110> this<00:00:32.259> little<00:00:32.439> cherry

book is awesome I mean this sketchbook
is<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.770> can<00:00:47.920> trace<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.880> you<00:00:49.090> don't<00:00:49.240> have

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
is you can trace it and you don't have

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.940 
is you can trace it and you don't have
to<00:00:49.450> follow<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.870> lines<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:50.410> can<00:00:50.560> just<00:00:50.770> draw

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
to follow the lines you can just draw

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.620 
to follow the lines you can just draw
however<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:51.550> want<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:51.790> draw<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.180> as<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.540> can

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
however you want to draw it as you can

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.630 
however you want to draw it as you can
see<00:00:52.720> I'm<00:00:52.930> not<00:00:53.020> even<00:00:53.260> following<00:00:53.680> any<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.130> I'm

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
see I'm not even following any of it I'm

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.790 
see I'm not even following any of it I'm
just<00:00:54.790> using<00:00:55.150> it<00:00:55.330> as<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.510> reference<00:00:55.660> that's<00:00:56.590> why

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
just using it as a reference that's why

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.340 
just using it as a reference that's why
I<00:00:56.830> sketch<00:00:57.100> books<00:00:57.370> on<00:00:57.490> it<00:00:57.520> oh<00:00:57.700> cool<00:00:58.020> okay<00:00:59.020> well

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
I sketch books on it oh cool okay well

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.420 
I sketch books on it oh cool okay well
there<00:00:59.470> we<00:00:59.560> go<00:00:59.590> there's<00:00:59.860> a<00:00:59.950> little<00:01:00.010> cherry

stencil paper this is that there's the
actual<00:01:10.780> wallpaper<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.350> we<00:01:11.470> were<00:01:11.530> using<00:01:11.770> for

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
actual wallpaper that we were using for

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.440 
actual wallpaper that we were using for
the<00:01:12.100> stencil<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.729> be<00:01:12.850> put<00:01:13.000> on<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> skin

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the stencil to be put on the skin

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.120 
the stencil to be put on the skin
there's<00:01:13.750> this<00:01:13.840> protective<00:01:14.409> layer<00:01:14.619> that<00:01:14.920> you

on<00:01:25.390> top<00:01:26.070> tape<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.550> doesn't<00:01:27.700> move<00:01:27.880> around

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
on top tape it so it doesn't move around

you really don't want to move around and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.810 
you really don't want to move around and
mess<00:01:32.140> up<00:01:32.170> your<00:01:32.560> whole<00:01:32.890> design<00:01:33.280> if<00:01:33.520> you've<00:01:33.670> done

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
mess up your whole design if you've done

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.730 
mess up your whole design if you've done
a<00:01:33.850> whole<00:01:34.270> big<00:01:34.600> old<00:01:34.780> piece<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.290> we<00:01:35.350> all<00:01:35.500> messed

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
a whole big old piece and we all messed

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.110 
a whole big old piece and we all messed
up<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.040> go<00:01:36.159> I'm<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:36.340> going<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.640> trace<00:01:36.909> right

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
up you go I'm just going to trace right

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.420 
up you go I'm just going to trace right
over<00:01:37.390> my<00:01:37.780> drawing<00:01:38.140> pretty<00:01:39.010> firmly<00:01:41.310> again<00:01:42.310> I'm

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
over my drawing pretty firmly again I'm

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.980 
over my drawing pretty firmly again I'm
not<00:01:42.550> going<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.760> trace<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.180> perfect<00:01:43.720> because<00:01:43.870> I

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
not going to trace it perfect because I

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.090 
not going to trace it perfect because I
didn't<00:01:44.170> really<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.440> all<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.650> other<00:01:44.799> one<00:01:44.979> I'm

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
didn't really do all the other one I'm

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:54.740 
didn't really do all the other one I'm
just<00:01:45.159> going<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.430> redraw<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.940> as<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.510> go

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.940 

there's<00:01:55.750> our<00:01:56.140> little<00:01:57.960> cherry<00:01:58.960> blossoms<00:01:59.530> put

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
there's our little cherry blossoms put

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.260 
there's our little cherry blossoms put
little<00:02:00.130> lives<00:02:00.399> there<00:02:00.610> make<00:02:00.820> sure<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.180> it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
little lives there make sure you do it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.760 
little lives there make sure you do it
pretty<00:02:01.390> further<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.840> more<00:02:01.990> firm<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:02.470> do<00:02:02.619> it

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
pretty further the more firm you do it

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.859 
pretty further the more firm you do it
the<00:02:02.920> darker<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.310> will<00:02:03.369> come<00:02:03.520> out<00:02:03.700> I'm<00:02:04.360> using<00:02:04.659> a

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
the darker it will come out I'm using a

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.810 
the darker it will come out I'm using a
thicker<00:02:05.590> point<00:02:05.920> which<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.250> bulb<00:02:06.520> that's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
thicker point which is a bulb that's

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.330 
thicker point which is a bulb that's
what<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.060> recommend<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.780> fire<00:02:08.590> point<00:02:08.920> would<00:02:09.130> kind

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
what I recommend a fire point would kind

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.940
