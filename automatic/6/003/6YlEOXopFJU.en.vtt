00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.490
 This time is how to catch the thing called the resurrection 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:18.260
 Christian traditional on black marker tricks from a traditional position in Christianity 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.970
 There is something called a form , but it captures it like that including that 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.789
 It is the Do it say whether the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.670
 By discussing 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.240
 that 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:31.189
 I've been wondering if the people are said to be so-called Gnosis 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.270
 If you look at Christ Church of people who are said to heresy idea and the traditional Christian position 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.740
 It is a way of thinking 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 Seen from the point of contrast of such things that 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.030
 It is said that you can clearly see the talk of Christianity by going back by trying to evacuate 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.610
 I have something to do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.960
 In this case, I felt as if I experienced the resurrection of Jesus, and I had a testimony like Emmaus's disciple 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.650
 It will be regarded as heresy immediately 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:04.590
 The resurrection authority of Jesus which should be this day-to-day experience 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:09.430
 It is not the spiritual experience of the believers here, but the testimony with sole foot and Peter and Christ's agent 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.659
 This is because the church that receives this is the only source of faith. 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.490
 Excuse me 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:20.380
 Perhaps even in today's society Some kind of psychic 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.990
 If Tteyuu Toka vision can be seen Toka voice heard after all 12 years the world Well clearly 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.550
 I think it is 50,000 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:31.210
 In that way 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.990
 Evil spirits swindles Jesus and the name of Jesus to do for either a look at whether that fake looking at that real 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 Is it 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 I do not know for a moment whether I am watching a real Jesus 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.140
 Kedomo thing to say that I do not know 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.710
 A few people in that world are real yes 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 Or real that sheet and rare 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:02:01.289
 May or may not have been those who had been advised by contact with 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.650
 After all I think that I think that is the way it is 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.880
 It is the moment that professed the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.130
 If it is in the Middle Ages, it will burn 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 This is almost correct 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.310
 This is also 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.680
 This is half of it, but that one that sang the name of Jesus is my treasure 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.680
 Speak the Name of True Christ with Basics 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.210
 The is that there is likely to be enforced with the evil spirits 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.560
 so 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.590
 Well I think I think that there is also a pretty racy book but I have a part mono 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.599
 These things are blamed on all the demons that open up 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.819
 Christian churches are buying roms or drawing if all is blamed for evil spirits and become a witch 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.010
 You will be on fire 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:48.190
 Should it happen to say it Deko become assistant principal and cut Once baptized person of that sugar industry 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.240
 That Christianity hot water towards the cormorant it because it is translation Gnosis 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.320
 In order to become a correctly 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.320
 I have to live 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.650
 If you get that baptism, it's not that it's not such easy thing to be in a single 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.970
 Ne 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.490
 Everyone is this this this simple this one page of that now 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.000
 So you that ticker 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.650
 that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.500
 But it is possible to say which do you think is correct when you chose this one 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.640
 Which one 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.060
 It insists you can convince it is that you can convince 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.260
 Is 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.250
 It is this church's claim 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.500
 Because only their boundaries are respecting the human period 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:38.720
 Asking a question in the church itself 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.720
 It was that people who say that they are heresy were right or not 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.880
 So I think that this is a very naive 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:57.790
 After that, one tail Bishop of the people of Norsis said that after all 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:03.790
 It is flower village, the heart of Tteyuu it says to lead to people not spiritually spiritually 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.690
 Believer of mind is suffering and say relates to the fact that continue to mature much more adult better of the semifinals 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.140
 I feel that 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.840
 I will do it 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.230
 Being a Christian to the state 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.910
 It's a thing that belongs to the church is a great 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.840
 And say whether or not to poison say that they belong to the church After doing that Jesus Christ is the Savior 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.600
 It means that you believe in the resurrection to admit that it is Christ 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.169
 It is to receive selection 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:34.910
 This is what Chukyo can do, but where are you already saved ? 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:37.810
 But that's right, that tower Gnosis is totally irrelevant . 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:45.550
 Now, according to the interpretation of Gnostic 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:48.900
 The word that Luke's kingdom of God is among you is the liberation of human beings in a true sense 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.330
 I 'm in the kingdom of God that requires human liberation 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.139
 It's about getting into 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.020
 Then it 's about the liberation of that human being to take care of being in Kanbe 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.100
 Good 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:05.870
 Not in historical sense in the sense of Gnostic 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.680
 The fact that Jesus was in paste does not mean that it will lead to liberation 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.510
 Ne 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.800
 It meant that it was only possible by internal transformation of human beings 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.009
 This is the interpretation of gnostic 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:24.700
 Because Jesus was resurrected there to paste because 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:31.129
 It is not that kind of salvation being saved because we believe in humanity 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:34.200
 It is not that it is an internal transformation of oneself in one's life 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:37.390
 I no change of thunder surface 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.490
 It will be released when a change occurs 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.529
 In terms of individual human beings 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.009
 that 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:47.540
 When According to the spiritual experience 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:54.590
 Struggling that the non-salvation because I do not happen to Nante so 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:57.550
 It is an interpretation, so from this point of view Jesus is a teacher who tells human beings the path of salvation 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.680
 A spiritual leader 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.550
 Considered as 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.129
 It will be said 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.209
 Yes you teacher 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.209
 It is one animal 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:16.470
 It is not that kind of Christ that he was saved because he believed he was a Savior 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.740
 This is very different from what you say 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:24.449
 It is that you are saying you different from this at all 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.050
 So and try to contrast in the this kind of wind you will see often something of Tteyuu Catholic 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.400
 Ne 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.680
 The threat of effort is very easy It is said that Jesus Christ hung on the cross and resurrected 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.180
 It means that you believe in things 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.980
 That you are saved by being baptized to believe that Jesus is the house of salvation 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.680
 By chance 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:45.980
 This is today's competition 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:50.470
 If that's not the case, you have to explain it 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.470
 I Which would be, or rather you guess right
