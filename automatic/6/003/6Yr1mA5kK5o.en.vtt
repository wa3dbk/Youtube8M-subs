00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
separate side and the wheelie bars are

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.260 
separate side and the wheelie bars are
built<00:02:34.740> into<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.160> frame<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.640> only<00:02:35.910> allow<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
built into the frame and only allow it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.380 
built into the frame and only allow it
to<00:02:36.300> wheelie<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.180> pretty

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
to wheelie like that so we get pretty

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.080 
to wheelie like that so we get pretty
good<00:02:39.480> pretty<00:02:40.260> good<00:02:40.380> traction<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> usually

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
good pretty good traction and it usually

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.970 
good pretty good traction and it usually
doesn't<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.780> leave<00:02:43.050> because<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> weight<00:02:43.800> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
doesn't we leave because of weight and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.700 
doesn't we leave because of weight and
lose<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:45.630> weight<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> motors<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
lose the weight of the motors in the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.600 
lose the weight of the motors in the
front<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.270> pretty<00:02:48.270> good<00:02:52.160> right<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.430> got<00:02:53.580> a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
front or pretty good right we got a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.440 
front or pretty good right we got a
hooked<00:02:53.910> up<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:55.370> hitch<00:02:56.370> built<00:02:56.760> into

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
hooked up it's just a hitch built into

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.020 
hooked up it's just a hitch built into
the<00:02:57.570> back<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:58.170> and<00:03:01.430> pulling<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.670> weight<00:03:02.850> of

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the back of it and pulling the weight of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.380 
the back of it and pulling the weight of
the<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.300> power<00:03:03.900> box<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.640> two<00:03:06.180> more

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the one power box and then two more

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.040 
the one power box and then two more
fully<00:03:06.810> loaded<00:03:07.140> battery<00:03:07.590> boxes<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.900> make

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
fully loaded battery boxes just to make

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.560 
fully loaded battery boxes just to make
sure<00:03:10.080> they're<00:03:10.380> fully<00:03:10.620> loaded<00:03:11.360> listen<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> him

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
sure they're fully loaded listen to him

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.330 
sure they're fully loaded listen to him
drop<00:03:13.370> yeah<00:03:14.370> they're<00:03:14.640> fully<00:03:14.850> loaded<00:03:15.120> too<00:03:15.360> heavy

ran over the raw flyer okay because I'm
tangled<00:03:53.159> see<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:53.849> that<00:03:53.879> 20<00:03:54.540> inch<00:03:54.689> of<00:03:54.870> sex<00:03:55.139> why

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
tangled see with that 20 inch of sex why

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.069 
tangled see with that 20 inch of sex why
there's<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.739> little<00:03:55.950> extra<00:03:56.340> wire<00:03:56.579> and

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
there's a little extra wire and

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.250 
there's a little extra wire and
sometimes<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.290> tire<00:03:58.530> runs<00:03:59.370> over<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.260> messes

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
sometimes the tire runs over it messes

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:12.110 
sometimes the tire runs over it messes
it<00:04:01.379> up<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.609> take<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:08.419> usually<00:04:10.549> just<00:04:11.549> like

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it up so take it and usually just like

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.939 
it up so take it and usually just like
wrap<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.540> around<00:04:12.750> one<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.199> those<00:04:13.319> hooks<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.769> got

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
wrap it around one of those hooks I got

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:21.400 
wrap it around one of those hooks I got
up<00:04:14.099> there<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.609> top<00:04:14.699> or<00:04:16.190> something<00:04:20.060> okay

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
make sure it won't lock up the tires

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.830 
make sure it won't lock up the tires
when<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:01.990> hits<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.350> top<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:03.630> one<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.750> those

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
when it hits the top is one of those

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.920 
when it hits the top is one of those
white<00:05:05.169> gears<00:05:05.979> are<00:05:06.970> those<00:05:07.120> white<00:05:07.419> Technic

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
white gears are those white Technic

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.770 
white gears are those white Technic

they're white and have a great piece in
the<00:05:12.310> middle<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.759> it<00:05:13.240> slips<00:05:13.690> under<00:05:14.110> certain

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
the middle and it slips under certain

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.800 
the middle and it slips under certain
amount<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:14.740> pressure<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.789> that's<00:05:16.240> what<00:05:16.449> i<00:05:16.479> use

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
amount of pressure and that's what i use

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:42.060 
amount of pressure and that's what i use
only<00:05:17.139> on<00:05:18.630> one<00:05:19.630> axle<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:20.229> sled<00:05:20.699> ok<00:05:21.699> second<00:05:22.330> run<00:05:41.070> ok

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
only on one axle a sled ok second run ok

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.439 
only on one axle a sled ok second run ok
yeah<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:44.160> didn't<00:05:45.160> even<00:05:45.280> really<00:05:45.639> I<00:05:46.120> mean<00:05:46.389> it

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
yeah it didn't even really I mean it

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.270 
yeah it didn't even really I mean it
gets<00:05:46.720> great<00:05:46.900> traction<00:05:49.260> but<00:05:50.260> sometimes<00:05:50.710> if

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
gets great traction but sometimes if

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.879 
gets great traction but sometimes if
it's<00:05:51.370> under<00:05:51.610> too<00:05:51.909> much<00:05:52.120> pressure<00:05:52.889> deyoung

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
it's under too much pressure deyoung

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.850 
it's under too much pressure deyoung
tires<00:05:54.430> will<00:05:54.880> slip<00:05:55.300> on<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.570> rim<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.470> rental

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
tires will slip on the rim the rental

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.480 
tires will slip on the rim the rental
spin<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.310> tires<00:05:57.550> won't<00:05:58.289> so<00:05:59.289> yeah<00:06:00.010> and<00:06:00.280> the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
spin and the tires won't so yeah and the

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.719 
spin and the tires won't so yeah and the
arm<00:06:00.669> to<00:06:01.710> keep<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.919> had<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.130> problem<00:06:03.460> with<00:06:03.639> the

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
arm to keep I had a problem with the

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.760 
arm to keep I had a problem with the
axles<00:06:04.300> bending<00:06:04.750> so<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.500> took<00:06:05.710> I<00:06:07.680> don't<00:06:08.680> know

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
axles bending so I took I don't know

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.700 
axles bending so I took I don't know
what<00:06:08.949> you<00:06:09.159> would<00:06:09.310> call<00:06:09.520> it<00:06:09.789> but<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.150> took<00:06:10.710> their

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
like disks that have holes in them took

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.610 
like disks that have holes in them took
two<00:06:14.979> of<00:06:15.099> those<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.699> put<00:06:15.940> two<00:06:16.300> pigs<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.289> put

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
three pegs through them and then just

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.350 
three pegs through them and then just
click<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.210> tire<00:06:22.479> on<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:23.080> tires<00:06:23.320> not<00:06:23.680> on<00:06:24.360> one

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
click the tire on the tires not on one

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.149 
click the tire on the tires not on one
of<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.630> axles<00:06:26.380> itself<00:06:27.630> so<00:06:28.770> yeah<00:06:29.770> I'm<00:06:29.949> going<00:06:30.009> to

put instructions up for the slide in a

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:41.040 
put instructions up for the slide in a
couple<00:06:35.560> days<00:06:35.740> so<00:06:37.380> II<00:06:39.360> mean<00:06:40.360> it's<00:06:40.509> a<00:06:40.539> fairly

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
couple days so II mean it's a fairly

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.529 
couple days so II mean it's a fairly
simple<00:06:41.259> sled<00:06:42.630> tractors<00:06:43.680> fairly<00:06:44.680> simple<00:06:45.539> but
