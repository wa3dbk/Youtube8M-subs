00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Here we are at Knockhill

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.000
it's now a nice sunny day

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
day after the touring car race in which I didn't finish

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500
but Renault didn't do any good either so I don't feel too bad

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
We're in the A610 Turbo

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
One of my favourite cars

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500
I had two when I was with Renault

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
and I throughly enjoyed them

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
a very under-rated car

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.500
This particular one has a history
which I'm sure everybody knows about

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Now we'll see how it goes round Knockhill

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Completing a sort of warm-up lap

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's hope it's in good condition

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Everything seems alright

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
Bit of camera shake there

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
will enhance the speed

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
OK. Second gear hairpin

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
try to get the power down smoothly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
bit of wheelspin

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500
up the main straight

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500
heading just left of the green lights

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
brings us up nicely on the left

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
110 mph as we come to the first corner

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.000
Down to 3rd

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
off the brakes

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
squeezing the throttle

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
not letting the car run across the road too much
