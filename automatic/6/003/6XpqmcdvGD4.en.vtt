00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.290
 what's wrong ankle is not welcome 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.240
 fan 360 we are distinguishing today 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.660
 I bring a tutorial a guide for 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.490
 use the only one the only one to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.190
 pierce the cut face and knock it down 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.480
 with the trick of this video I upload 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.890
 because there are still many people who 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.599
 is asking questions and follows me 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.439
 asking how to do it how it works 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.550
 what numbers will we put back there 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.170
 the first important thing that I have to 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.570
 know is to know what ips to connect 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.750
 our console is valid in the case in the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.970
 my case as you see there is the novel 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.620
 68.1 point 11 you have to aim either 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.500
 whatever your console is going to launch 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.269
 the configuration of networks and look mother 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.230
 and once that we are going to give little program 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.269
 in suit we have to put that number ip 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.489
 then in powder you leave it in rne and I 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.140
 I can only say that of xbox that is 30 74 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.690
 is worth so we have it in 3 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.080
 the wheat lump in zero the three aces 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.300
 in 80 and other three of 80 also what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.420
 click in demand for it 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.160
 He tells us that we have put before and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.899
 nothing once configured this way already 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 we will go directly to do the trick 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:26.850
 Well, we are here, we are in 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.490
 direct we also hang around here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.490
 same the system now we activate 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.510
 we waited about 23 seconds we spent 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:42.120
 we go out we jump here and we deactivate 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.230
 and this column and we hope here the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.780
 we have to fix on the left horn 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.880
 for example there and fix when you're 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.800
 puntita crowd nyse there we have to 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 connect and so it's over you should 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.060
 be the back wall all green and that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.640
 appear crota if the whole world appears 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.820
 green and does not appear crota that is that you 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.100
 had given a little before once 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.200
 we have the ball we have to turn off the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.750
 have to pay the program so that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.700
 do not 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.960
 so that we do not pull the game a few 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.490
 times and read it a lot the day of the 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.640
 game that does not have the reward of 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.610
 pay quickly and you're done 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.290
 and not as I say can download something that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.300
 come out only a half green mule is the one 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.610
 gives life to give out the green wall 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.370
 and make us route about age soon and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.160
 if it comes out as the video by all green and 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.380
 creta is the perfect thing and nothing has been 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 the guide I hope that today has been 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.540
 quite clear 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.569
 it can always vary a bit 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.799
 what would be the configuration but good 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.280
 I think that this will go a long way 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.530
 all right 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.510
 I for example that I have 100 megs worth 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.430
 what I do is put the console always 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.659
 although I play with cable I always play 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.159
 with the ethernet cable plugged in 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.530
 console what I do and foreras by 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.180
 wifi with the console via wifi because 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.879
 the connection is a bit worse and easier 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.709
 the real thing or anything I hope you have been 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.530
 useful I hope that this time has been 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.569
 quite clear 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.850
 Any doubt to the comment but good 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.910
 I'm going to upload it again 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.060
 on this subject but that has been 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.860
 clear and nothing a greeting manito 369 in 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.860
 next videos to god
