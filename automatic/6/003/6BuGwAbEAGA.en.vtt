 well found we are in third place and in black and white 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.280
 he anticipates that I am preparing an entire nation for my course 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.890
 photoshop that you find on www.conad dedicated entirely black and white 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.509
 we see 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.250
 a solution that I really like a little puzzled 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.080
 fashion room I like treasure here to reflect 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 see photo. photo to yourself really a lot 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 we have this image 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 clearly to move here it is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.720
 on his level we go to have a look here in the toilet of the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.990
 channels 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.540
 where we find the channels 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.490
 green and blue bear 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.000
 which are the three event channels if a man has a photoshop is at all systems 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 digital image to recreate our image. 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.560
 facebook twitter on the blue channel that we see that we also discover that channel 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.650
 is high on the world of presentation 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.380
 the black and white of the brightness of the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.880
 shell now we don't go into the mouse in this discussion that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 we provide blue 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.650
 this plan that this is already a beautiful black and white you see the little church 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.840
 that stands out co 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.120
 the two Berlusconi cypresses on the side 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.490
 funny guy with shades of gray that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.539
 these 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.539
 the bridge the fairies of yellow flowers 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.200
 on the image 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.870
 you can't just sleep in what we've seen in the previous one with i 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.700
 Berlusconi filters it's up to those ounces 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
 so he devoted himself a lot 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.260
 let's go see the channel of the blessed and see that we have called here 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.490
 designed present the flowers have become me away 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.650
 the churches more or less always the same, the fools are a little less flat year 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.910
 a little bit more contrast to friends 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.489
 fountain of bloom 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.409
 and now let's take a look at the red channel and look how nice 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.279
 the less text bianconi auchan is already so like it very much 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.459
 we have 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.749
 contrast diskette 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.729
 a hill behind the scu 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.569
 you want to see well at the church. contrasted been very out 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.829
 and these too are part 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.759
 very bright 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.329
 that we have a little bit the surface flower of so much good what it is 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.729
 anyway 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.979
 as you can see we already have other whites and blacks a lot 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.590
 different from each other from my opinion for example constructive the red horse 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.619
 already beautiful you. 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.439
 almost. 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.930
 how to use we will see in the tutorial -4 cents dedicated black and white 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.599
 what I will do 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.669
 in a few 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.879
 at this point what we can do we could do as a select 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.339
 select all 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.209
 here you see then we make a simple one 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.969
 copy paste 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.819
 couple 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.240
 then we return to the case channel of select 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.199
 the rgb channel when 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.429
 compound channel is called 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.450
 sure they have 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.980
 here our gym we can open an empty channel and then we do desert 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.980
 his almost in port 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:27.519
 and here it is 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.539
 we have a host of art we can save in photoshop cont format 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.269
 costa del sol in black and white that we can save in gta interpellate 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.759
 go directly from here 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.939
 and under the beauty that a person with google 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.079
 so we get this file in photoshop format we have it anyway 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.679
 in our 2 versions 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.379
 dicofarm when we want to print here is where we print this when we have to 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.519
 print in black and white 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.529
 we print 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.450
 this act so I always remember you when there is a black and white of the middle 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.449
 first look at it 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.749
 here it is, take a look 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.670
 but the channels 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.019
 because often 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 in the canal found already a beautiful black and white time 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.239
