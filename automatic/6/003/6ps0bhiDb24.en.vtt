tracks and if you not managing them
properly<00:00:22.599> it's<00:00:22.840> going<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:23.050> be<00:00:23.169> very<00:00:23.439> hard<00:00:23.740> and

you're going to spend a lot of time
cutting<00:00:25.599> tracks<00:00:26.020> to<00:00:26.230> get<00:00:26.380> them<00:00:26.650> organized

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
cutting tracks to get them organized

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.060 
cutting tracks to get them organized
properly<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.079> an<00:00:29.199> example<00:00:29.470> of<00:00:29.770> track

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
properly here is an example of track

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.910 
properly here is an example of track
management<00:00:30.610> on<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:31.539> specific<00:00:32.140> day<00:00:32.320> we<00:00:32.619> were

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
management on a specific day we were

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.910 
management on a specific day we were
doing<00:00:33.280> some<00:00:33.670> control<00:00:34.300> burn<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:35.170> an<00:00:35.350> le<00:00:35.559> copter

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
doing some control burn on an le copter

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.290 
doing some control burn on an le copter
and<00:00:36.160> we<00:00:36.610> work<00:00:36.910> in<00:00:37.300> four<00:00:37.930> different<00:00:38.110> area<00:00:38.650> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and we work in four different area and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.970 
and we work in four different area and
basically<00:00:40.300> we<00:00:40.809> want<00:00:41.019> to<00:00:41.110> get<00:00:41.260> four<00:00:41.620> different

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
basically we want to get four different

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.040 
basically we want to get four different
tracks<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.790> problem<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.390> because<00:00:43.750> we

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
tracks the problem is that because we

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.680 
tracks the problem is that because we
kept<00:00:44.350> our<00:00:44.589> GPS<00:00:45.309> without<00:00:45.640> resetting<00:00:46.449> the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
kept our GPS without resetting the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.600 
kept our GPS without resetting the
tracks<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.199> saving<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.680> tracks<00:00:47.920> we<00:00:48.430> also

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
tracks and saving the tracks we also

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.210 
tracks and saving the tracks we also
have<00:00:48.879> all<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.239> run<00:00:49.449> where<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.290> look<00:00:50.470> at<00:00:50.589> when

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
have all the run where the look at when

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.920 
have all the run where the look at when
to<00:00:51.400> do<00:00:51.519> some<00:00:51.790> refueling<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.510> really<00:00:52.750> don't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
to do some refueling and we really don't

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.439 
to do some refueling and we really don't
need<00:00:53.140> all<00:00:53.470> this<00:00:53.769> track<00:00:54.460> set<00:00:54.670> what<00:00:54.879> we<00:00:54.909> want<00:00:55.299> is

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
need all this track set what we want is

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.930 
need all this track set what we want is
exactly<00:00:55.900> when<00:00:56.229> we<00:00:56.440> were<00:00:56.619> burning<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:57.159> what<00:00:57.790> we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
exactly when we were burning so what we

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.490 
exactly when we were burning so what we
should<00:00:58.150> have<00:00:58.180> done<00:00:58.449> is<00:00:58.690> when<00:00:59.049> we<00:00:59.199> arrived<00:00:59.470> on

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
should have done is when we arrived on

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.049 
should have done is when we arrived on
the<00:00:59.680> spot<00:00:59.769> just<00:01:00.129> before<00:01:00.430> we<00:01:00.549> start<00:01:00.760> our<00:01:00.879> work

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
the spot just before we start our work

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.210 
the spot just before we start our work
we<00:01:01.689> should<00:01:01.720> have<00:01:02.019> saved<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.409> track<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:02.920> clear

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
we should have saved the track and clear

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.520 
we should have saved the track and clear
the<00:01:03.369> track<00:01:03.580> in<00:01:03.939> the<00:01:04.119> current<00:01:04.420> tracks<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:04.839> one

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
the track in the current tracks and one

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.770 
the track in the current tracks and one
we<00:01:05.890> arrive<00:01:06.159> at<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.580> end<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.820> our<00:01:06.939> work<00:01:07.180> for<00:01:07.659> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
we arrive at the end of our work for the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.530 
we arrive at the end of our work for the
first<00:01:08.020> part<00:01:08.380> then<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.220> save<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> track<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.119> we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
first part then we save the track and we

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.359 
first part then we save the track and we
clear<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:10.960> again<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.560> we<00:01:12.010> should<00:01:12.070> have<00:01:12.250> done

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
clear it again and we should have done

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.399 
clear it again and we should have done
the<00:01:12.460> same<00:01:12.640> thing<00:01:12.700> for<00:01:13.210> all<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.509> them<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
the same thing for all of them the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.780 
the same thing for all of them the
parameters<00:01:14.890> because<00:01:15.189> we<00:01:15.310> haven't<00:01:15.490> done<00:01:15.729> that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
parameters because we haven't done that

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.609 
parameters because we haven't done that
we<00:01:16.299> have<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.540> cut<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.930> paste<00:01:16.990> all<00:01:17.439> these

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
we have to cut and paste all these

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.900 
we have to cut and paste all these
tracks<00:01:17.860> it's<00:01:18.130> going<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.340> take<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> long<00:01:18.730> time

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
tracks it's going to take a long time

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.660 
tracks it's going to take a long time
but<00:01:19.870> if<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:21.040> would<00:01:21.190> have<00:01:21.250> done<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.520> right

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
but if we would have done the right

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.670 
but if we would have done the right
thing<00:01:21.730> it<00:01:22.120> would<00:01:22.360> have<00:01:22.480> any<00:01:22.720> apply<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.350> shred

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
thing it would have any apply that shred

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.460 
thing it would have any apply that shred
away<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.100> once<00:01:24.250> we<00:01:24.490> connect<00:01:24.880> our<00:01:25.120> GPS<00:01:25.690> we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
away and once we connect our GPS we

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.350 
away and once we connect our GPS we
would<00:01:26.650> have<00:01:26.830> trade<00:01:27.190> away<00:01:27.310> for<00:01:27.760> different<00:01:28.210> nice

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
would have trade away for different nice

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.149 
would have trade away for different nice
tracks<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.900> first<00:01:29.140> one<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.770> second<00:01:30.130> one

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
tracks the first one the second one

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.910 
tracks the first one the second one
third<00:01:30.760> one<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.510> fourth<00:01:31.540> one<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.710> at<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
third one and the fourth one so at the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.250 
third one and the fourth one so at the
beginning<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.460> first<00:01:33.700> one<00:01:34.110> save<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
beginning of the first one save the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.960 
beginning of the first one save the
track<00:01:35.500> clear<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.040> track<00:01:36.280> in<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.700> current

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
track clear the track in the current

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.450 
track clear the track in the current
tracks<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.330> when<00:01:37.990> we<00:01:38.170> finish<00:01:38.470> our<00:01:38.650> run<00:01:38.860> we<00:01:39.040> do

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
tracks and when we finish our run we do

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.350 
tracks and when we finish our run we do
the<00:01:39.610> same<00:01:39.760> thing<00:01:40.000> again

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
the same thing again

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.300 
the same thing again
and<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:41.350> do<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.560> same<00:01:41.590> thing<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.220> other

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
and we do the same thing for the other

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.790 
and we do the same thing for the other
one<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:43.810> don't<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.080> any<00:01:44.200> work<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.560> do<00:01:44.680> on

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
one so we don't have any work to do on

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
a new one and it's going to be very easy

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.720 
a new one and it's going to be very easy
to<00:03:20.629> find<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.200> later<00:03:21.500> on<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.980> don't<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.579> won't

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
to find it later on you don't you won't

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.080 
to find it later on you don't you won't
have<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.180> do<00:03:23.299> some<00:03:23.599> cut<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.079> paste<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:26.060> I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
have to do some cut and paste so I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.699 
have to do some cut and paste so I
really<00:03:26.390> recommend<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.900> every<00:03:27.290> time<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.590> go

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
really recommend that every time you go

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.600 
really recommend that every time you go
in<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.860> field<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.250> know<00:03:28.340> you're<00:03:28.459> going<00:03:28.579> to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
in the field you know you're going to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.039 
in the field you know you're going to
recall<00:03:28.879> something<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> track

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
recall something and go to the track

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.500 
recall something and go to the track
manager<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.519> current<00:03:31.880> track<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.400> go<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
manager to the current track and go to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.240 
manager to the current track and go to
save<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.660> track<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.139> clear<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> track<00:03:37.010> and

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
save the track and clear the track and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.759 
save the track and clear the track and
once<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.700> finish<00:03:38.030> your<00:03:38.660> work<00:03:38.870> do<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.590> same

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
once you finish your work do the same

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.020 
once you finish your work do the same
thing<00:03:39.950> again<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.370> time<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.819> have<00:03:40.850> a

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
thing again all the time and you have a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.480 
thing again all the time and you have a
very<00:03:41.299> easy<00:03:42.160> way<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.609> manage<00:03:43.910> your<00:03:44.090> track
