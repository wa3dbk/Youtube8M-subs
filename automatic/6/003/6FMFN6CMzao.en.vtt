00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.600 
yeah here is very interesting not about
that<00:03:57.909> drone<00:03:58.239> this<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.720> evz<00:03:59.379> base<00:03:59.590> raised<00:03:59.950> year

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
that drone this is evz base raised year

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.160 
that drone this is evz base raised year
looks<00:04:00.790> like<00:04:01.000> sink-or-swim<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.870> actually

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
looks like sink-or-swim is actually

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.199 
looks like sink-or-swim is actually
forced<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.560> come<00:04:02.709> back<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.129> his<00:04:03.250> base<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.760> figure

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
forced to come back to his base I figure

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.089 
forced to come back to his base I figure
1<00:04:04.510> what<00:04:05.200> yay

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
1 what yay

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.460 
1 what yay
I<00:04:06.129> think<00:04:06.670> he<00:04:06.790> was<00:04:06.909> on<00:04:07.030> mine<00:04:07.390> crawler<00:04:07.780> here<00:04:08.200> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
I think he was on mine crawler here and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.710 
I think he was on mine crawler here and
no<00:04:08.829> minerals<00:04:09.280> being<00:04:09.549> mine<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:10.180> he<00:04:10.510> has<00:04:10.689> a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
no minerals being mine and he has a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.630 
no minerals being mine and he has a
superior<00:04:11.290> force<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.859> he's<00:04:12.040> saying<00:04:12.370> that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
superior force and he's saying that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.069 
superior force and he's saying that
