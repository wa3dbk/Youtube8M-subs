00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.600
 good to all we are in the writer in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.840
 the program that we can do our 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.870
 own mods this time we are therefore if in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.080
 the previous video we did food go 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 by God I think I do not know this time we're going 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.250
 to make a good armor this is very 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 shortly you will see in all general are 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 very short but this is very short 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.949
 also good first thing we have to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.869
 do is download the map as you know 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.869
 you and me 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.879
 download the map google maps 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.540
 the program install whatever and good 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.629
 once open we give go to the right 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 and here we have several tabs 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.629
 here we have to make text 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 armor texture is valid and we have here 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.620
 our 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 good armor that we can change it from 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 standard what iron and diamond and everything 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.330
 this to leader and without mail it is worth of the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 call before 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.480
 and I 'm going to do it in standard and I'm going to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.480
 catch a color 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 I know that we are going to take it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.840
 Brown 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.930
 brown kaka 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.630
 it's not worth anything let's go to justice armor 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.240
 we have to take the name we want 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.820
 without using space here it puts unused 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.480
 spaces you can put poop armor 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.260
 why not 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.270
 Now when we can choose exit vale 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.820
 when it changes now you will see it now 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 same has not changed color because 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.990
 is loading the program 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.119
 now we are going to exit this out and now 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.420
 we have the texture this you can do 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.440
 also apart for example I use the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.690
 paint.net 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.210
 that separates you by pixels then this 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.880
 for more English then it goes that shoots like this 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.680
 that you can use them if you want to put 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.810
 a lesson are calling that voucher 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.710
 let's go to new mod 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.250
 Now we have chosen the name of the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:29.710
 mod our armor because make a 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:33.870
 mod is going to split armed weapon 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.870
 hard kaka 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.470
 we give ok 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.160
 helmets we select our 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.160
 here 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.650
 they selected our parts for god 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.540
 true 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.100
 and this and we give next 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.500
 from here and well we put the name of 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.450
 our armor hard weapon of poop the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.490
 name of 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.140
 of the texture 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.140
 we point out the brown 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.060
 well this is the damage absorbed by the 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.900
 arm our armor 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.269
 here 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.640
 I'm full of that holds a little 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.260
 more because the poop is tough and good 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.849
 here are the hearts one of the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.459
 shields that's like saber are shields not 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:47.170
 I know someone else's point I remember said now 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.549
 same and good are the points 2 is a 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.480
 heart 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.300
 let's say heart 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.989
 one is mean let's go for example here 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.950
 right now seven and a half I think 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:04.450
 let's count eight nine ten 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.450
 and five hearts 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.569
 five hearts eight and a half eight 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.910
 hearts and a half we are going to put one in 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.609
 head 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.720
 and one breast 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:25.670
 OK 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.670
 right now it would be 8 16 16 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.780
 1819 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.290
 this is either charming or in accounting 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.140
 let's say it so you can 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.310
 enchant up to the maximum level we give to 5 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.129
 let's go to next 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.090
 and here 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:48.440
 we put the recipe of our 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.560
 no this 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.950
 armor let's put what you create 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:00.180
 with hong kong with a gone gone gone gone 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.180
 what not 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.520
 what else does total 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:13.130
 that is created with bread is worth 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.130
 because no noses 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.229
 ok we put them all 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.220
 and now I come back when I have already 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.760
 all now we will see 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.790
 when we finish and well I go back where 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.700
 there is bread and here 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.510
 well we're done now 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.920
 we already have everything good something else 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.050
 things that I am going to tell you about this 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.820
 section here can also flee 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.190
 for example an object that is of the helmet 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:59.670
 as with everything or crafter what 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.510
 what you want with something else is that 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:07.050
 if for example you get confused you give here and 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.270
 for example you put lava and you give to ok 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.580
 here you will see the lava item and that 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.430
 you can not erase it's worth so you'll have 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.320
 to cancel we return the repeat 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.280
 what do you have to take care of the 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.960
 time to put it wrong what yes that 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.840
 we can do is therefore change it 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.910
 for example to do this is worth but what 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.320
 you can not do is eliminate the good already 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:33.230
 they are looking at ways if you can not 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.630
 Well this little thing we have here and if 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.520
 you do not know already I say it is that you can 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.850
 change when we create this is not from 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.380
 now man a helmet or two or three or 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:49.540
 four to 99 it seems to me that you could 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.850
 that is not necessary but we give to next and 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.070
 we have already finished it is very easy as 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.890
 you have seen very short 7 minutes 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.010
 more or less we will see seven minutes 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.750
 good and so this would be all in the 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.910
 next tutorial we will see how it is done 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.300
 a plant I am very interesting already 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.130
 you will see and then a mod this surely 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.000
 I leave it for the end because it's going to be 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.070
 longer and good you have asked me things 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.370
 before for example making a biome a 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:21.610
 dimension and good little things here that there 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:25.260
 Pretty cool, so if it's so 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.260
 yes that has come to god
