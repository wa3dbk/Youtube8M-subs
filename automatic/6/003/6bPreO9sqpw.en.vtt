00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
playoffs and that's just pathetic - in

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.309 
playoffs and that's just pathetic - in
his<00:02:56.099> three<00:02:56.400> years<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.909> head<00:02:57.090> coach<00:02:57.299> we<00:02:57.750> were<00:02:57.989> 2

his three years as head coach we were 2

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.050 
his three years as head coach we were 2
and<00:02:58.849> 22<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.900> 20<00:03:01.620> against<00:03:02.340> teams<00:03:02.849> that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and 22 and 20 against teams that

finished the season with the winning

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.809 
finished the season with the winning
record<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.549> horrible<00:03:09.019> horrible<00:03:10.609> -<00:03:11.609> and

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
record that is horrible horrible - and

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.849 
record that is horrible horrible - and
20<00:03:12.180> against<00:03:12.480> good<00:03:12.810> teams<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.709> we've

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
20 against good teams and I think we've

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.199 
20 against good teams and I think we've
been<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.400> close<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:19.650> always<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:20.340> one<00:03:20.790> loss
