better and things like that and maybe
down<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.409> road<00:02:01.439> maybe<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> year<00:02:02.729> from<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
down the road maybe a year from now I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
down the road maybe a year from now I
don't<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.840> I'll<00:02:04.170> consider<00:02:04.560> putting<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
don't know I'll consider putting in a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.940 
don't know I'll consider putting in a
supercharger<00:02:05.909> turbo<00:02:06.290> uh<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.500> reason<00:02:07.799> why<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
supercharger turbo uh the reason why I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.580 
supercharger turbo uh the reason why I
am<00:02:08.399> basically<00:02:08.910> happy<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> v6<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
am basically happy with the v6 the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.900 
am basically happy with the v6 the
reason<00:02:10.800> why<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.310> car<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
reason why this is the car that I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
reason why this is the car that I
personally<00:02:12.690> prefer<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
personally prefer out of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.589 
personally prefer out of
all<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.799> Camaro's<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.459> mainly<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
all the Camaro's is mainly because of

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.190 
all the Camaro's is mainly because of
the<00:02:15.840> mileage<00:02:16.409> this<00:02:17.010> car<00:02:17.310> gets<00:02:17.549> like<00:02:18.170> close<00:02:19.170> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the mileage this car gets like close to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.710 
the mileage this car gets like close to
29<00:02:19.980> miles<00:02:20.280> per<00:02:20.580> gallon<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> highway<00:02:21.150> as

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
29 miles per gallon on the highway as

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.320 
29 miles per gallon on the highway as
far<00:02:22.409> as<00:02:22.500> its<00:02:22.650> rated<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.190> where<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> live<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
far as its rated and where I live it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
far as its rated and where I live it
seems<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.260> around<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.769> mean<00:02:26.099> it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
seems to get around that I mean it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.589 
seems to get around that I mean it
depends<00:02:26.489> on<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.849> temperatures<00:02:27.330> are

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
depends on what the temperatures are

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.470 
depends on what the temperatures are
what<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.959> altitude<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.150> these

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
what the altitude is and then on these

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.089 
what the altitude is and then on these
you<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.140> city<00:02:31.379> side<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.769> things<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
you know on the city side of things you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.630 
you know on the city side of things you
get<00:02:32.159> about<00:02:32.370> 21<00:02:33.590> 19<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.190> range<00:02:35.430> which<00:02:35.610> is

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
get about 21 19 in that range which is

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.039 
get about 21 19 in that range which is
pretty<00:02:35.940> good<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.209> better<00:02:36.390> than<00:02:36.540> my<00:02:36.690> Impala

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
pretty good it's better than my Impala

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.520 
pretty good it's better than my Impala
was<00:02:37.349> which<00:02:38.040> was<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> last<00:02:38.459> car<00:02:38.730> ad<00:02:39.049> so<00:02:40.049> overall

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
was which was the last car ad so overall

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.869 
was which was the last car ad so overall
it<00:02:40.769> gives<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.010> good<00:02:41.129> mileage<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.640> gives<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.849> a

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
it gives you good mileage it gives you a

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.990 
it gives you good mileage it gives you a
really<00:02:42.150> nice<00:02:42.269> power<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.780> think<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.260> car<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
really nice power I think this car is a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 
really nice power I think this car is a
very<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.569> know<00:02:45.599> powerful<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.590> least<00:02:46.769> for

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
very you know powerful for at least for

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500 
very you know powerful for at least for
what<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.190> need<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.489> don't<00:02:47.640> need<00:02:47.760> anything<00:02:48.150> crazy

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
what I need I don't need anything crazy

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.140 
what I need I don't need anything crazy
it<00:02:49.379> goes<00:02:49.530> 0<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.829> 60<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.519> automatic

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it goes 0 to 60 in this automatic

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.630 
it goes 0 to 60 in this automatic
version<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.629> about<00:02:51.840> 6.2<00:02:52.709> seconds<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.609> is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
version at about 6.2 seconds which is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.970 
version at about 6.2 seconds which is
plenty<00:02:54.510> enough<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.930> me<00:02:55.049> I'm<00:02:55.620> not<00:02:55.650> really<00:02:55.859> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
plenty enough for me I'm not really a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.149 
plenty enough for me I'm not really a
powerhouse<00:02:56.340> type<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.940> guy<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.890> know<00:02:58.920> down

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
powerhouse type of guy but you know down

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.009 
powerhouse type of guy but you know down
the<00:02:59.280> road<00:02:59.310> adding<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.909> a<00:03:00.060> turbo<00:03:00.480> would<00:03:00.690> be<00:03:00.810> cool

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the road adding in a turbo would be cool

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.599 
the road adding in a turbo would be cool
because<00:03:01.170> then<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.409> get<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> v8<00:03:01.980> power<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.579> of

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
because then you get the v8 power out of

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.869 
because then you get the v8 power out of
that<00:03:02.730> v6<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:04.170> also<00:03:04.379> get<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.190> mileage<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
that v6 and you also get the mileage of

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.610 
that v6 and you also get the mileage of
a<00:03:06.000> v6<00:03:06.180> obviously<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> mileage<00:03:07.319> will<00:03:07.409> drop<00:03:07.590> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
a v6 obviously the mileage will drop a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.920 
a v6 obviously the mileage will drop a
little<00:03:07.920> bit<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.909> won't<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> gas<00:03:09.420> guzzler

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
little bit but it won't be a gas guzzler

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.390 
little bit but it won't be a gas guzzler
and<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.140> won't<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.500> know<00:03:10.590> basically<00:03:11.129> find

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
and you won't you know basically find

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.059 
and you won't you know basically find
yourself<00:03:11.790> filling<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.629> every<00:03:13.049> every<00:03:13.890> road

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
yourself filling up every every road

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.220 
yourself filling up every every road
trip<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.489> take<00:03:14.700> or<00:03:14.849> every<00:03:15.030> little<00:03:15.269> Joyride
