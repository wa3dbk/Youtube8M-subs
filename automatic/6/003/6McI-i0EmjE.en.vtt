00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.220
 bad mood I do not want this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.490
 sharing with you because 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.750
 you do not deserve it most likely I 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.189
 The fact is that I downloaded movies today 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.150
 trackers do not know for them or not for them 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.150
 I flew Windows 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.689
 not only that sims 3 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.790
 exactly the preservation was removed so still 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.140
 the keys to deceit are gone well who knows 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 he will understand that for me the keeper will have to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.149
 it's all recover then walk 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 here and there and then many more records words 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.579
