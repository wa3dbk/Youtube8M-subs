 race on this Wednesday, January 21st 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.330
 the racecourse of paris-vincennes do 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.000
 four-day break from the grand prix 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.490
 of america opodo the hippodrome of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.279
 cagnes-sur-mer the substitute for a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 new quinté plus that addresses to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.910
 age trotters this will be the price a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 of May here is my selection for this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.960
 encounter I placed in the lead number 9 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.970
 elves joy that stays on three podiums 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 consecutive the last two in date 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.590
 obtained on the route that interests us 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.510
 the horse is confirmed or even 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 more confirmed on this course and on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.930
 this track he is fit well engaged 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.210
 at the first post in my opinion it's a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 good base for your quinté 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.570
 then the wall at 3l trad I like it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.469
 do not judge on his last 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.989
 disqualification 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.670
 it went wrong for him in the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.840
 first turning before the horse 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 had accumulated the good results a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.190
 victory at the beginning of the meeting followed by 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 third and a 2nd place here in this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 lot we find a great opportunity to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 to talk again to him is a horse that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.609
 also like this track and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 who is allied to succeed tracks 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.309
 flat like that of the Racecourse of the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 french riviera 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 the ciss these titans dabo a hard horse to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.930
 the effort that is for the winter meeting 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 placed in the boxes of Nicolas Ensch 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 it is property is regularly 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 driven by hervé bald the weak 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.740
 it has therefore placed in the stable 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.189
 nicolas ensch for this season 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.150
 winter 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.860
 know that the horse is a good 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
 on two honorable performances on 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.299
 this track 3rd and 5th know especially 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.650
 that he will be ironed from the four feet for 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.329
 the first time in your career you have to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.740
 see it as a sign of confidence 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.119
 then the 13 guys from walnut in 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.710
 class more in my opinion she has nothing to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.890
 envy to rest of the pack 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 that said she did not give satisfaction 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 in any case she did not run first 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.880
 in the price of the French Riviera 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 they should show progress on 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 its performances but first and foremost 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.710
 she reassures reason why do 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.020
 figure that fourth in my 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 prognosis but know that it's a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.680
 true specialist of this track 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.560
 she already has 10 victories on this 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280
 course hours in vain delivery on 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.290
 the Cagnois ring 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.080
 then I remembered fourteen a cloud of 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.670
 smooth which is certainly not sure 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.140
 three consecutive disqualifications to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.180
 vincennes yet the quality does not 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.230
 does not fail it starts here at 15 on 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.840
 sea ​​with ambitions 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.370
 provided you remain wise the number 16 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.450
 / Beauvoisin of which remains a 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.010
 excellent second place in the price 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.670
 of the Riviera it was deferré des 4 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.230
 e day there this time it will be shoe 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.630
 which tempers our optimism 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.830
 then the 8 sapphire of the wolves 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.870
 opinion is better than this 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.280
 year ranking also will be deferré 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.080
 of the four feet which no longer helps 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.730
 made since December 2013 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.650
 it is better to be wary of 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.510
 Outsider lovers worth attention 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640
 also number 10 sapphire perch it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.610
 seems barred for success but a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.350
 fourth place or a fifth can him 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.820
 return to favor of a hidden course 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.620
 in ambush 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.480
 so for the regrets we will quote the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.610
 number 10 a number to the pardon rodney 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.520
 encrypted summary charms for this 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.410
 quinté + cannois 9 3 6 13 14 16 8 and 10 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.480
 years as non- starter I will quote number 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.220
 It came back from the lassus charms of 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.920
 program at Cagnes sur Mer in the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.959
 third I recommend 304 beautiful 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.070
 manne jet he has a lot of assets in his 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.330
 game not only is it the richest 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.489
 but he also stays on a win 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.170
 the scene is his only exit on the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.050
 course that interests us is sold 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.730
 by a short second place it's a 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.830
 opportunity all found and a candidate to 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.800
 the victory the beautiful 304 madjer that 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.970
 would put the 305 brabus that owns the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.190
 best time of the peloton on the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.410
 course that interests us is the 301 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.610
 also his brutus the reynard he 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.530
 to redeem it has proved its 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.819
 qualities previously before at that's to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.120
 say before that 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.629
 a disqualification 304 5 and 1 in the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.319
 fifth the 510 to the stars in mind 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.129
 esteemed by an icon and brilliant 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.780
 promises to be formidable 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.189
 she already has nine wins in twelve 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.980
 public benefits she can heal 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.209
 we oppose his stats with 509 julie who 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.040
 will discover this track but it's a 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.200
 talented trotter always presented to good 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.609
 coached by his coach jean paul 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.230
 gauvin 510 and 509 in the 6th stable 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.150
 chavatte the chavatte family looks good 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.829
 represented with the 614 and who Chinese 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.930
 who likes this track and the 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.419
 has three wins in six attempts 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.849
 in my opinion it can still improve this 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.909
 score is 617 also his accomplice 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.319
 the training is vougeot de mouriès 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.540
 who will enjoy this course and who 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.769
 will mostly run in improvement after 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.130
 a profitable rehearsal 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.750
 recently on this track 614 617 the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.430
 protected from the family chavatte 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.320
 also be careful about 815 an opa 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.070
 vautier who seem to me to find here a 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.229
 lot within reach 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.639
 he faces a beautiful commitment he is 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.599
 especially candied in this race 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.030
 reserved for apprentices and lads jockeys 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.610
 imad benaggoun approaching 50 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.389
 success he can count 45 since the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.880
 the start of his career 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.699
 so the 815 a poverty candidates to 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.830
 follow for those targeted to cagnes 3rd 5th 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.479
 6th and 8th little word also on pau en 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.240
 meeting 2 I advise you 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:49.590
 in the fourth the 405 cfer sman not 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.039
 for the victory but for a place in 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.349
 nice odds 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.909
 the horse has not run for several 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.590
 month now but according to his 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.180
 coach brings the leclerc the horse has du 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.050
 work would not be surprised to see her 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.849
 at the finish of this race 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.340
 especially since the horse made the finish 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.479
 of this competition last year which 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.930
 he can do as well this year to 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.780
 nice odds 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.500
 so beware 405 forsman in the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.509
 next 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.090
 christian baillet is well represented 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.320
 with the 62nd myasun she 503 white desert 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.990
 who has a first chance 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.330
 theoretical white desert and maybe 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.219
 best according to him on 400 m but he has 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.900
 already won on 7 13 hundred meters psf to 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.979
 chantilly 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.020
 so he will be able to highlight himself 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.300
 in this lot and the ca are 2000 alone him 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.770
 can be taken speed on this 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.600
 pretty rolling course on this psf 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.560
 rolling but he likes on the sand 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.910
 opposition in his strings 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.270
 he also has a first chance 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.100
 500 2 503 both protected from christian 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.039
 fagot Eric leray could shine 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.740
 in the seventh and that 504 azzaro of the 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.419
 mare and the blue and pink 711 which 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.340
 have just finished on the podium of a 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.690
 proof of the same invoice disputed 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.139
 recently on this track 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.340
 a paloise and finally the 813 manzi me 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.660
 seems to find opposition in his 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.460
 strings she had finished second of a 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.169
 proof of the same invoice on this plot on 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.780
 December 30 here the opportunity is him 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.210
 given to cross the pole in the lead on 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.660
 sum it all up in numbers on the 813 manzi 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.970
 704 and 711 which must confirm the 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.590
 502 to 103 training fights that 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.330
 has a theoretical first chance and 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.220
 the 400 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.530
 Vauvert speaker and ferry his number 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.449
 it's firth man who can come 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.280
 the trio's reports in this 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.000
 meet very good game at all good 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.000
 day and tomorrow
