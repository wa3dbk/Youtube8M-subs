00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
clouds is an interesting level it's got

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.820 
clouds is an interesting level it's got
more<00:00:19.680> wind<00:00:20.189> that's<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.630> thing<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.619> got

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
a heck of a lot of wind most of this

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.679 
a heck of a lot of wind most of this
level<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.980> will<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.250> spent<00:00:26.609> flying<00:00:27.269> around

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
level you will be spent flying around

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.259 
level you will be spent flying around
gliding<00:00:28.439> around<00:00:28.560> collecting<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.820> teensies

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
gliding around collecting the teensies

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.780 
gliding around collecting the teensies
running<00:00:30.779> into<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> links<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> lumps<00:00:31.949> once

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
running into the links of the lumps once

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.720 
running into the links of the lumps once
again<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.239> need<00:00:33.390> 600<00:00:34.079> lumps<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.620> 10<00:00:35.130> teensies

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
again you need 600 lumps and 10 teensies

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.290 
again you need 600 lumps and 10 teensies
total<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.420> 100%<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.440> level<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:39.059> first

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
total to 100% this level and the first

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840 
total to 100% this level and the first
one<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.500> royalty<00:00:41.219> teensie<00:00:41.670> which

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one is actually a royalty teensie which

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.799 
one is actually a royalty teensie which
is<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> rock<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:45.149> deanzie<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
is up in that rock and this deanzie is a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.690 
is up in that rock and this deanzie is a
little<00:00:46.289> bit<00:00:46.440> difficult<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.670> least

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
little bit difficult to get at least

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
little bit difficult to get at least
early<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.629> probably<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> harder

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
early on it's probably one of the harder

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.369 
early on it's probably one of the harder
ones<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.170> need<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
ones and that's just because you need to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.740 
ones and that's just because you need to
glide<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> wind<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.239> jump<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
glide up in the wind then jump on the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.689 
glide up in the wind then jump on the
parachutes<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.710> enemies<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
parachutes of these enemies now if you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.250 
parachutes of these enemies now if you
want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.329> try<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.750> between<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
want to you can try to get between the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
want to you can try to get between the
parachute<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.430> enemy<00:00:59.579> itself<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> jump

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
parachute and the enemy itself and jump

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
parachute and the enemy itself and jump
on<00:01:00.840> them<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.920> kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> make

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
on them like this and just kind of make

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
on them like this and just kind of make
your<00:01:02.609> way<00:01:02.699> over<00:01:02.809> where<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.840> need<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
your way over where you need to go that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
your way over where you need to go that
way<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> teensie<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.590> also

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
way you can get the teensie and you also

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
way you can get the teensie and you also
get<00:01:07.920> lumps<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.580> killing<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> enemies<00:01:09.390> but

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
get lumps for killing the enemies but

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
get lumps for killing the enemies but
you<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> jump<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> enemies

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you really have to jump on the enemies

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
you really have to jump on the enemies
of<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:13.049> somehow<00:01:13.500> either<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> parachute<00:01:14.520> or

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
of like somehow either on a parachute or

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
of like somehow either on a parachute or
on<00:01:14.970> themselves<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> next<00:01:16.799> win

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
on themselves to get on to the next win

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
on themselves to get on to the next win
the<00:01:18.030> second<00:01:18.450> minor<00:01:18.840> teens<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the second minor teens you will be

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.640 
the second minor teens you will be
jumped<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> guy<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:22.259> course<00:01:22.470> be

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
jumped on by that guy and of course be

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.070 
jumped on by that guy and of course be
sure<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.159> defeat<00:01:23.580> any<00:01:23.820> enemies<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> run<00:01:24.900> into

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
sure to defeat any enemies you run into

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
sure to defeat any enemies you run into
and<00:01:25.560> any<00:01:26.159> random<00:01:26.700> plants<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and any random plants you see just so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.929 
and any random plants you see just so
you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.320> many<00:01:28.560> lumps<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.189> possible<00:01:29.790> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
you can get as many lumps as possible so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.380 
you can get as many lumps as possible so
you<00:01:29.970> don't<00:01:30.180> risk<00:01:30.479> getting<00:01:31.610> 599<00:01:32.610> lumps<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you don't risk getting 599 lumps and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
you don't risk getting 599 lumps and
then<00:01:33.540> getting<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> end<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> level<00:01:35.340> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
then getting to the end of the level and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
then getting to the end of the level and
then<00:01:35.820> being<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> redo<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> whole

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
then being like I have to redo the whole

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.240 
then being like I have to redo the whole
level<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.150> annoying

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.700 

so<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.120> will<00:01:44.240> be<00:01:44.360> another<00:01:44.570> team<00:01:44.930> Z<00:01:45.170> up<00:01:45.380> there

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
so there will be another team Z up there

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.910 
so there will be another team Z up there
just<00:01:46.070> use<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.700> wind<00:01:47.080> because<00:01:48.080> there's<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.620> lot

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
just use the wind because there's a lot

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.430 
just use the wind because there's a lot
of<00:01:48.950> wind<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.720> much<00:01:51.350> wind<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:53.110> destroy<00:01:54.110> that

Wallace<00:01:55.010> wall<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.970> bones<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.840> move<00:01:57.290> over<00:01:57.680> here

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.290 

this<00:02:03.500> coin<00:02:03.800> isn't<00:02:04.400> really<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.729> hard<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.119> get

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
this coin isn't really that hard to get

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.930 
this coin isn't really that hard to get
just<00:02:05.600> try<00:02:06.020> not<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.260> go<00:02:06.470> down<00:02:06.710> too<00:02:07.100> far<00:02:07.400> or<00:02:07.729> you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
just try not to go down too far or you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.470 
just try not to go down too far or you
will<00:02:08.119> probably<00:02:08.720> die<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.429> fly<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:11.270> up

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
will probably die and then I fly on up

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.949 
will probably die and then I fly on up
so<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.170> get<00:02:12.320> as<00:02:12.500> far<00:02:12.800> away<00:02:13.040> from<00:02:13.160> that

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
so you can get as far away from that

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.050 
so you can get as far away from that
spiky<00:02:14.959> plant<00:02:14.990> as<00:02:15.709> possible<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.850> can

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
spiky plant as possible and so you can

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.640 
spiky plant as possible and so you can
get<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> third<00:02:17.630> teens<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.170> know<00:02:18.260> I've<00:02:18.620> had

work for you try to get up there again
jump<00:03:29.269> down<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.170> die<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.970> want

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
jump down and and die so what you want

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.050 
jump down and and die so what you want
to<00:03:32.360> do<00:03:32.510> instead<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.049> keep<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.190> wall<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.670> bones

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
to do instead is keep that wall of bones

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.240 
to do instead is keep that wall of bones
there<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.690> use<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.230> wall<00:03:36.500> jump<00:03:36.829> so<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.040> can

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
there and use it to wall jump so you can

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.130 
there and use it to wall jump so you can
get<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.670> other<00:03:37.910> royalty<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:38.930> think

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
get to the other royalty and I think

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.160 
get to the other royalty and I think
it's<00:03:39.260> just<00:03:39.320> regular<00:03:39.590> teensie

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
of float down to the left try to avoid

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.260 
of float down to the left try to avoid
the<00:04:13.970> giant<00:04:14.330> spiky<00:04:14.780> fish<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.560> get<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.370> TT<00:04:16.790> but

the giant spiky fish and get the TT but

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.790 
the giant spiky fish and get the TT but
what<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:17.420> was<00:04:17.570> saying<00:04:17.870> was<00:04:18.080> that<00:04:18.140> there's<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
what I was saying was that there's a

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.860 
what I was saying was that there's a
point<00:04:19.100> in<00:04:19.430> some<00:04:19.880> levels<00:04:20.210> where<00:04:20.420> it<00:04:20.600> doesn't

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
point in some levels where it doesn't

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.570 
point in some levels where it doesn't
matter<00:04:21.020> which<00:04:21.200> way<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.500> take<00:04:21.830> up<00:04:22.130> or<00:04:22.340> down

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
matter which way you take up or down

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.730 
matter which way you take up or down
you're<00:04:23.390> gonna<00:04:23.540> get<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> same<00:04:24.140> place<00:04:24.290> and

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
you're gonna get to the same place and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.730 
you're gonna get to the same place and
sometimes<00:04:25.490> there's<00:04:25.820> nothing<00:04:26.780> either<00:04:27.050> one<00:04:27.470> in

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
sometimes there's nothing either one in

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.210 
sometimes there's nothing either one in
either<00:04:28.340> way<00:04:28.670> so<00:04:29.420> hopefully<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.500> can<00:04:30.740> explain

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
either way so hopefully I can explain

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.210 
either way so hopefully I can explain
what<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.520> means<00:04:31.640> later<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:33.070> basically<00:04:34.070> I

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
what that means later on but basically I

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.830 
what that means later on but basically I
should<00:04:34.610> just<00:04:34.880> say<00:04:35.890> explore<00:04:36.890> everywhere<00:04:37.280> and

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
should just say explore everywhere and

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.760 
should just say explore everywhere and
try<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.900> leave<00:04:39.470> no<00:04:39.770> stone<00:04:40.310> unturned<00:04:40.340> because

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
try to leave no stone unturned because

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.560 
try to leave no stone unturned because
this<00:04:42.770> game<00:04:42.980> is<00:04:43.040> really<00:04:43.520> good<00:04:43.880> at<00:04:44.180> hiding

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
this game is really good at hiding

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.080 
this game is really good at hiding
things<00:04:44.780> right<00:04:45.740> where<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.160> would<00:04:46.400> expect<00:04:46.430> them

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
things right where you would expect them

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.670 
things right where you would expect them
and<00:04:47.420> also<00:04:47.630> hiding<00:04:47.900> them<00:04:48.140> right<00:04:48.410> where<00:04:48.560> you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
and also hiding them right where you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.040 
and also hiding them right where you
would<00:04:48.860> not<00:04:49.010> expect<00:04:49.070> them<00:04:49.730> it's<00:04:50.540> like<00:04:50.720> here<00:04:50.960> if

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
would not expect them it's like here if

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.660 
would not expect them it's like here if
I<00:04:51.140> were<00:04:51.230> to<00:04:51.290> go<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.560> top<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:51.950> bottom<00:04:52.220> it

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
I were to go on the top of the bottom it

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.520 
I were to go on the top of the bottom it
wouldn't<00:04:52.940> matter<00:04:53.030> but<00:04:53.780> I'm<00:04:53.900> gonna<00:04:54.020> go<00:04:54.260> back

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
wouldn't matter but I'm gonna go back

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.160 
wouldn't matter but I'm gonna go back
and<00:04:54.770> go<00:04:55.430> kill<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.090> enemy<00:04:56.630> just<00:04:56.810> because<00:04:57.080> I

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
and go kill that enemy just because I

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.740 
and go kill that enemy just because I
want<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.470> extra<00:04:57.770> lumps<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.340> I'm<00:04:59.180> nearing<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
want the extra lumps and I'm nearing the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.560 
want the extra lumps and I'm nearing the
end<00:04:59.870> of<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.140> level<00:05:00.410> now<00:05:00.820> just<00:05:01.820> jump<00:05:02.180> onto<00:05:02.450> this

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
end of the level now just jump onto this

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.550 
end of the level now just jump onto this
mushroom<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.940> for<00:05:04.940> here<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.840> running

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
mushroom and for here it's a running

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.800 
mushroom and for here it's a running
type<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.980> situation<00:05:07.670> it's<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.970> auto-scrolling

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
type of situation it's a auto-scrolling

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.510 
type of situation it's a auto-scrolling
I<00:05:09.170> guess<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.470> could<00:05:09.500> call<00:05:09.770> it<00:05:09.830> because<00:05:10.280> you're

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
I guess you could call it because you're

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.090 
I guess you could call it because you're
being<00:05:10.670> chased<00:05:10.940> by<00:05:11.180> spiky<00:05:11.870> vines<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:12.890> be

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
being chased by spiky vines so be

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.190 
being chased by spiky vines so be
careful<00:05:13.430> here<00:05:13.580> you<00:05:13.850> want<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.420> make<00:05:14.810> sure<00:05:14.840> to

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
careful here you want to make sure to

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.830 
careful here you want to make sure to
jump<00:05:15.560> on<00:05:15.830> their<00:05:16.210> parachutes<00:05:17.210> or<00:05:17.420> as<00:05:17.540> I<00:05:17.660> said

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
jump on their parachutes or as I said

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.510 
jump on their parachutes or as I said
before<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.320> can<00:05:18.350> try<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.650> jump<00:05:18.950> between<00:05:19.040> them

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
before you can try to jump between them

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.790 
before you can try to jump between them
to<00:05:19.790> jump<00:05:20.480> on<00:05:20.720> each<00:05:21.020> enemy<00:05:21.290> and<00:05:21.590> they<00:05:21.680> can

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
to jump on each enemy and they can

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.890 
to jump on each enemy and they can
continue<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:23.090> will<00:05:23.240> be<00:05:23.360> chasing<00:05:23.780> this

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
continue and you will be chasing this

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.080 
continue and you will be chasing this
last<00:05:24.200> TD<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:24.950> probably<00:05:25.430> won't<00:05:25.640> catch<00:05:25.820> up<00:05:25.970> to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
last TD you probably won't catch up to

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.210 
last TD you probably won't catch up to
it<00:05:26.240> until<00:05:26.360> that<00:05:26.660> point<00:05:26.900> but<00:05:27.650> once<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.070> get

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
it until that point but once you get

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.850 
it until that point but once you get
that<00:05:28.460> teensie<00:05:29.000> then<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.600> should<00:05:30.050> have<00:05:30.080> close

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
that teensie then you should have close
