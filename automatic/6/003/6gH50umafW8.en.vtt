00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.020 

it<00:02:19.640> doesn't<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.180> go<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.480> stop<00:02:21.170> it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
it doesn't want to go and stop it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.450 
it doesn't want to go and stop it
neutral<00:02:23.030> reverse<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.900> again<00:02:27.560> reverse<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.250> not

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
neutral reverse and again reverse is not

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.130 
neutral reverse and again reverse is not
wanting<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.760> turn<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.180> wheels
