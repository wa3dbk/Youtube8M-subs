00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
upgraded so that's going to be my next

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.450 
upgraded so that's going to be my next
one<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:52.950> sure<00:01:54.649> like<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.740> might<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.009> seem<00:01:56.430> like

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
one for sure like I might not seem like

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.200 
one for sure like I might not seem like
much<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.119> plus<00:01:57.509> 30<00:01:57.810> damage<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.850> mean<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
much but plus 30 damage you mean the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
much but plus 30 damage you mean the
difference<00:02:00.240> between<00:02:00.600> killing<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> CC<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:01.860> not

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
difference between killing the CC or not

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.690 
difference between killing the CC or not
killing<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> CC<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:04.140> war<00:02:04.350> attack<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.579> it's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
killing the CC in a war attack so it's

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
killing the CC in a war attack so it's
pretty<00:02:05.909> important<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.550> only<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.330> guess<00:02:10.020> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
pretty important the only I guess you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.400 
pretty important the only I guess you
could<00:02:10.259> say<00:02:10.410> defensive<00:02:11.009> structure<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
could say defensive structure that I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.260 
could say defensive structure that I
my<00:02:12.590> gold<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.160> far<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.580> my<00:02:13.760> clan<00:02:14.060> castle

going<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.800> make<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> manifesto<00:02:43.640> about<00:02:44.450> 9.5<00:02:45.280> it's

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
going to make a manifesto about 9.5 it's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.500 
going to make a manifesto about 9.5 it's
probably<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.940> little<00:02:47.150> bit<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
probably going to be a little bit of a

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.960 
probably going to be a little bit of a
long<00:02:47.750> one<00:02:47.990> so<00:02:48.020> i<00:02:48.230> might<00:02:48.500> split<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.070> I'm<00:02:49.820> just

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
long one so i might split it up I'm just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.640 
long one so i might split it up I'm just
because<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.390> way<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.570> record<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.470> all

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
because the way I record this is all

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.120 
because the way I record this is all
like<00:02:52.520> freestyle<00:02:53.090> no<00:02:53.570> no<00:02:54.230> editing<00:02:54.620> or<00:02:54.800> anything

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
like freestyle no no editing or anything

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.730 
like freestyle no no editing or anything
so<00:02:56.060> if<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.420> stuff<00:02:56.690> up<00:02:56.840> 30<00:02:57.140> minutes<00:02:57.440> into<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
so if I stuff up 30 minutes into the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.820 
so if I stuff up 30 minutes into the
video<00:02:57.830> then<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.460> gotta<00:02:58.760> start<00:02:59.000> again<00:02:59.800> so<00:03:00.800> I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
video then I gotta start again so I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.910 
video then I gotta start again so I
might<00:03:01.100> cut<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.490> up<00:03:01.580> into<00:03:01.760> shorter<00:03:02.120> parts<00:03:02.510> and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
might cut it up into shorter parts and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.110 
might cut it up into shorter parts and
actually<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.160> structured<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.850> might

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
actually have it structured I might

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.000 
actually have it structured I might
actually<00:03:05.240> write<00:03:05.990> out<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.170> script<00:03:06.290> or<00:03:06.650> something

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
actually write out a script or something

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.080 
actually write out a script or something

like<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.760> didn't<00:03:56.330> really<00:03:56.450> enjoy<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:59.230> elixir

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
like that didn't really enjoy it elixir

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.720 
like that didn't really enjoy it elixir
is<00:04:00.970> pretty<00:04:02.150> hard<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.480> come<00:04:02.690> by<00:04:02.840> x<00:04:03.730> so

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
is pretty hard to come by x so

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.940 
is pretty hard to come by x so
that's<00:04:05.390> why<00:04:05.510> i<00:04:05.540> prefer<00:04:05.750> down<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.440> crystal

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
that's why i prefer down in crystal
