but<00:00:23.100> let's<00:00:23.400> check<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.789> clip

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:42.500 

now<00:00:32.760> this<00:00:32.970> is<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> club<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.840> swifting<00:00:41.450> now<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
now this is a club with swifting now you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
now this is a club with swifting now you
can<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.380> animation<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.250> cancelled

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
can see that the animation is cancelled

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.569 
can see that the animation is cancelled
check<00:00:45.900> out<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> side-by-side<00:00:46.430> comparison

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.000 

I<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:54.390> clearly<00:00:54.659> see<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.499> right<00:00:55.710> side

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I can clearly see that the right side

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.509 
I can clearly see that the right side
which<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.339> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.329> Swift<00:00:57.659> arm<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.649> faster

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
which is with the Swift arm is faster

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.369 
which is with the Swift arm is faster
than<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.909> one<00:01:00.089> without<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:00.780> using<00:01:01.350> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
than the one without and using that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
than the one without and using that
animation<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.729> this<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.210> give<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.479> an

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
animation so this will give you an

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.499 
animation so this will give you an
advantage<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.589> sniping<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:06.060> allow

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
advantage into sniping and will allow

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.109 
advantage into sniping and will allow
you<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.320> kills<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:08.009> your<00:01:08.310> ammo<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you to get more kills with your ammo and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.410 
you to get more kills with your ammo and
you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.110> doing<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.770> faster<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:12.180> here's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you know just doing it faster now here's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.980 
you know just doing it faster now here's
a<00:01:12.479> clip<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:14.070> faster<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.210> doing<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.600> faster

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
a clip of a faster of doing it faster

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.530 
a clip of a faster of doing it faster
and<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.909> infinite<00:01:17.909> ammo

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.180 

now<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> got<00:01:25.230> a<00:01:25.260> lot<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.620> bullets<00:01:26.070> out

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
you can clearly see that my ammo count

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.690 
you can clearly see that my ammo count
on<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.370> bottom<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.140> bottom<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.290> screen<00:01:34.700> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
on the bottom a bottom right screen it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.280 
on the bottom a bottom right screen it
shows<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:38.060> bullet<00:01:39.060> count<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.540> goes<00:01:39.990> back

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
shows that the bullet count it goes back

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
shows that the bullet count it goes back
but<00:01:40.770> even<00:01:40.920> though<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.490> does<00:01:41.700> shoot<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> bullet

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
but even though it does shoot the bullet

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
but even though it does shoot the bullet
you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.690> see<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.080> bullet<00:01:43.260> holes<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.160> do

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you can see the bullet holes and I do

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
you can see the bullet holes and I do
shoot<00:01:44.730> more<00:01:45.120> than<00:01:45.150> what<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.660> have<00:01:46.110> even<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.980> like

in the clip I think I shot one two three
four<00:01:50.250> five<00:01:50.460> six<00:01:50.520> seven<00:01:50.910> eight<00:01:51.090> nine<00:01:51.180> nine

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
four five six seven eight nine nine

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bullets but i only have seven bullets in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
bullets but i only have seven bullets in
my<00:01:54.840> clip<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.740> here's<00:01:55.950> another<00:01:56.250> example<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
my clip now here's another example I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:10.480 
my clip now here's another example I
shot<00:01:57.360> 12<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.040> good<00:01:59.280> kado

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.600 

now<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.270> clearly<00:02:11.750> see<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.680> shot<00:02:13.280> way

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
now you can clearly see that I shot way

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.260 
now you can clearly see that I shot way
more<00:02:13.880> than<00:02:14.450> what<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.870> had<00:02:15.580> now<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.850> because

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
more than what I had now this is because

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.320 
more than what I had now this is because
of<00:02:17.300> swifting<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> really<00:02:19.550> fast<00:02:19.700> you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
of swifting if you do it really fast you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.950 
of swifting if you do it really fast you
can<00:02:20.600> achieve<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.710> could<00:02:21.950> also<00:02:21.980> get

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
can achieve it and you could also get

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.540 
can achieve it and you could also get
like<00:02:23.960> have<00:02:24.380> more<00:02:24.650> animal<00:02:25.040> than<00:02:25.070> what<00:02:25.400> you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
like have more animal than what you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.350 
like have more animal than what you
should<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.370> think<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:28.970> going<00:02:29.270> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
should have but I think this is going to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.380 
should have but I think this is going to
be<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> good<00:02:29.810> way<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.530> improve<00:02:31.310> your<00:02:31.550> sniper<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
be a good way to improve your sniper and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.340 
be a good way to improve your sniper and
I'm<00:02:33.200> going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> show<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.860> how<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:35.350> so

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
I'm going to show you how to do it so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
first off you're going to need a bolt
