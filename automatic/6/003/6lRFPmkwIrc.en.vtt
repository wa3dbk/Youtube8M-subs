 and then just go let's do it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.899
 shows under the high voltage line 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.590

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.149
 then finally rest must therefore at 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.969
 such things if he is such a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 High voltage power line is high frequencies 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.930
 take and there you have peace 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.070
 but well 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.070
 it's not easy to walk 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.290
 so we have the job changes 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.360
 Meadow was wonderfully mowed and to look for 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.710
 great but that with the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.720
 high-voltage lines that got me yet 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.010
 pretty annoyed because I have to with the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.760
 Frequency I do not walk 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.690
 I am from and about what I mean 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.310
 power lines probably there 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.800
 the only thing left is the whole sport or 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.720
 I often met the rooms one 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.190
 place changed bit in forest 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.640
 I do not really like it 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 but you know miles now somewhere 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.220
 you have a bit of me movies 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.710
 Well 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.710
 Let's see what has to spend until the same 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.659
 so people look here because poldi

 believe that iron chain have the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.159
 probably the trunks pulled out not 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.420
 Bad there can be seen 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.409
 Well, look what else you do 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.159
 not quite 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.159
 chorleiter let's see what comes out 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.190
 the time 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.830
 did not sound that way but well 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:45.330
 only an old cartridge, unfortunately, little 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:48.140
 scrap here little signals but well times 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.140
 see what else is coming 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.440
 a temple stop 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.049
 With 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.580
 so I drink now rÃ¶merwall 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:56.050
 maybe it will help maybe 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:58.450
 always something from the roman times so people 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.580
 wonderful again changed the place 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.920
 and you can still get a nice old coin 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.740
 I do not realize what it is that I get 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.870
 it may well be that way 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.870
 then move on to the next one and all 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.670
 wonderful two steps further without 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.380
 nonsense of the next superman 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:26.710
 that can only be a nice day 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.710
 will be great too 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:39.920
 Here was the coin we have you 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:42.250
 just shown i think so all over 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.030
 without signal 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.030
 Let's see what that is 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:24.500
 I think that's outside no idea 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.090
 Of course, no coin was somehow 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.190
 if you want to film it then they are 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.300
 two coins next to each other no idea 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:41.900
 something molten piece of metal 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:45.440
 okay, it continues like this 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:49.040
 figured out a kind of button from 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.810
 horse harness or something already received 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.050
 actually not broken that looks 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.050
 beautifully made 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.340
 next hit wonderful silver coin 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.129
 I think it of which I have already 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.220
 I can compare two well I do 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.979
 clean but really great people 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.970
 third coin and we are straight 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.800
 Forty-five minutes maybe on the way 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.060
 and the third could be awesome 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.360
 It's worth it here we have to go again 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.580
 down 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.870
 okay people let's see if I really 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.819
 now on the way back yet 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.909
