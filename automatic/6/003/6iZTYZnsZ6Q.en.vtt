00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.490
 continue to master 3d max 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.710
 in this lesson we will insert 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.910
 in our scene objects that we 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.000
 created with you throughout 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.770
 previous lessons that is, we are with you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.860
 we will combine scenes in other words 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.050
 then open the scene we created 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.470
 in the last lesson who kept on 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.599
 last lesson and get down to start us 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.350
 about here you need to put the table 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.780
 with the chairs that we created earlier 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.410
 To do this, go to the file mouse 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.160
 combine choose folder where are 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.059
 our objects 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.320
 where is the scene file of our objects 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.870
 and choose accordingly my table and 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.329
 the chair is called the file is all chosen do 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.939
 open choose objects that will be 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.549
 insert into our scene means we all 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.540
 we will therefore select them and click ok 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:16.010
 all here he put in but they are small 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.470
 the fact is that I painted in millimeters and 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.060
 there took 70 millimeters high and so 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.939
 further in the end they are very small right now 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.970
 turned out that for an hour here goes 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.299
 bill per meter and even we need now 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.470
 I scale these objects 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.920
 right click key scale tool 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.540
 on it and ask here for a thousand percent 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.920
 I will increase all here please 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.689
 now i need to align that is not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 attacked need to put them for this i 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.390
 alignment will use the first 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.729
 alignment tool showing by 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.009
 what object will I equal on the floor 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.869
 equal and now they choose there not by x 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.649
 I donâ€™t need to move the game on z 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.950
 move further choosing means minimum 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.200
 that is, the bottom of my objects 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.189
 must be equal to the maximum that is 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.049
 top of the floor all ok here 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.750
 please don't stand on my floor 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:21.030
 now move closer 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.350
 the window is ready let's color the floor 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.700
 let's change that it was darker with us that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.720
 different from tables and chairs 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.160
 everything is ready now we will put here 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 glasses and plates again I will 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.270
 merging scenes means going to the file 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.060
 marge and pick me they are saved here in 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.610
 this file you may have in some 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 a friend of my own name open 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.190
 and choose what I will insert so I 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:01.020
 Here is a glass and a plate I keep the counter and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.570
 click on the desired name all the same here 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.250
 again he put in 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.610
 But I can't see why the fact is that 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.620
 I have them there were hidden as it were 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.840
 hidden so i flick right 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.330
 mouse button if you did it too 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.010
 so you kind of inserted but not visible and 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.769
 who are most likely they are just hidden 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.950
 Right-click and do on high 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:36.270
 all just have not appeared now 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:37.680
 drag again 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.250
 I'm taking it easy now again 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.930
 table alignment tool and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.770
 besides it turns out on z I move 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.780
 the minimum of my objects with a maximum became 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.190
 ok 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.050
 All if you do not have a plate if you have it 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.870
 didn't create something you can create to her 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.050
 using the latte method, that is, using 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.050
 modifier voted in the same way as 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:09.480
 and created a glass that is drawn 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:12.480
 first profile of the glass for example here then 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:17.630
 apply the cotton modifier the same with 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.630
 plate that is, draw the profile of the plate 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.190
 here so for example here and then apply 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.120
 modifier here and to turn 360 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.530
 degrees this profile 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.170
 now a plate and a glass 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.110
 place the shift on the table here and 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.910
 we drag object we release we do 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.060
 insta dependent copy the same here 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.330
 keep dragging separate the plate 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:54.680
 hold shift and transfer neatly 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:56.380
 all now here it is also a glass 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:03.220
 here 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:06.520
 and here all now we still have a napkin 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.820
 under the plate put a napkin draw with 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:18.490
 using the plane of the plane we stretch 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:21.850
 let's set the size and for example 350 to 450 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.190
 such a napkin will be quantity 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.710
 segments in length and in width one by one 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.780
 take everything again 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.370
 alignment okay so here 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.650
 see it a little we merge 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.610
 so you need to slightly raise 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.290
 literally there per millimeter means axis 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.280
 z we will move now in the window 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.980
 perspective I ask z 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.280
 relatively and include 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:54.820
 coordinates and ask per millimeter 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:01.060
 everything is ready let's make a napkin 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:06.760
 white and now copy hold 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:16.540
 shift from here we will copy and here now 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:23.850
 rotate 90 degrees and copy to 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.850
 this side is all here with us ready 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.050
 Now we will hang the lamp next to the mirror 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.100
 which we created earlier 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.200
 again we go merch at my here 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.720
 this file can save you maybe 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:46.200
 in a different way somehow open doing a highlight 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:56.690
 ok all here she got me too 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:07:06.180
 dragging grouped make groups 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:14.650
 let's call the lamp ok so now we have it 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:22.169
 let's turn on the day 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:22.169
 degrees and put next to and stenochkoy 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:32.800
 move aside and now copy 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:38.410
 on the other side hold shift again 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:40.800
 we take the moose and drag it like 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.600
 make a dependent copy instant everything 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.430
 let's move a little keep kontru 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:55.060
 select the object and and a bit of them 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:08:02.850
 let's move as well away from the wall all 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:09.849
 we set our furniture weighed ceiling 

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:11.830
 let's move a little bit and now 

00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:14.800
 in the next lesson we'll be with you 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.070
 arrange the lights on this our 

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.070
 the lesson is over
