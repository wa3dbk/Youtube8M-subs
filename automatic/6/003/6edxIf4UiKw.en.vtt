 cup of gouda cheese salt and pepper as

 first step in a pot let's melt 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.390
 the butter 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 let's add the onion 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.020
 and we're going to cook it over medium heat until 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.070
 that the onion is a color 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.019
 transparent 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.620
 very carefully we are going to add the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.620
 zoom in 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.740
 ah 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.740
 and chicken broth 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.170
 peace 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.759
 let's mix it this very well 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.979
 as always there has to be 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.979
 temperature at medium heat 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.130
 We are the cornstarch with a little bit of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 water that we are going to mix everything very well 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.420
 until there are no thrombi 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.600
 we are going to add the cornstarch with water to the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.200
 mix that we had previously with 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.550
 the essence and the chicken stock and also 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.550
 let's add the nutmeg 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.050
 let's mix everything very well and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.820
 leave cook over medium heat until 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.070
 this becomes thick 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.640
 Now that is heavy you are going to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.590
 add the carrot 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.140
 and broccoli 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.789
 and we're going to let it simmer 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.380
 until the carrot and broccoli 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.690
 be soft 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.060
 since the carrot and the broccoli are 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.790
 We are going to add cheese 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.790
 that he wants and the cheese as it is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.160
 we are going to mix everything very well until 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.140
 that are melted 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000
 and if they do not want it to stay that way, 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.720
 thick you can add a little more 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.430
 of hassan hard or chicken broth 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.430
 to season to taste with salt and pepper 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.420
 like the cheeses are a bit salty like that 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.890
 that you have to be careful with how much 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.890
 the amount of salt that we are going to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.049
 since the cases are melted and what 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.150
 we have seasoned to taste and it is already 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.590
 ready to serve 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.930
