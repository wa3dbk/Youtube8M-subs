pace in their mighty 77 piece which is
which<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.690> enough<00:02:43.019> for<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.650> building<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.220> like

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
which is enough for the building is like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.850 
which is enough for the building is like
it's<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.360> very<00:02:45.630> nice<00:02:45.989> amount<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> piece<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.739> this

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
type of build and and I was hoping I

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.699 
type of build and and I was hoping I
don't<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.000> he<00:02:51.299> kept<00:02:51.750> performing<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.380> me<00:02:52.560> i

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
was struggling at times but that was

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.110 
was struggling at times but that was
more<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.410> struggling<00:02:58.920> together<00:02:59.430> as<00:02:59.879> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
more like struggling together as the

team liking that kidney you can see us
getting<00:03:02.190> battered<00:03:03.079> but<00:03:04.079> no<00:03:04.230> man<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.650> he

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
getting battered but no man it's just he

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.559 
getting battered but no man it's just he
did<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.610> knew<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.299> board

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
did that you knew what to do the board

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.569 
did that you knew what to do the board
I've<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.170> hoping<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.799> do<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> few<00:03:08.250> more<00:03:08.370> times

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
I've just hoping to do a few more times

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.920 
I've just hoping to do a few more times
but<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:08.819> going<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> keep<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.329> doing<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.690> looks

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
but I'm going to keep on doing it looks

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.300 
but I'm going to keep on doing it looks
like<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.110> could<00:03:10.290> make<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.590> nice<00:03:10.829> bit<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.069> profit

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
like I could make a nice bit of profit

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000 
like I could make a nice bit of profit
if<00:03:11.549> i<00:03:11.640> was<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.819> sell<00:03:12.120> him<00:03:12.349> so<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.799> little

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
if i was to sell him so it was a little

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.979 
if i was to sell him so it was a little
inconsistent<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:15.120> times<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.629> i<00:03:15.690> think

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
inconsistent at times but i think

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.890 
inconsistent at times but i think
actually<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.650> may<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.220> been<00:03:17.400> myself

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
actually that may have been myself

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.840 
actually that may have been myself
rather<00:03:18.900> than<00:03:19.109> just<00:03:19.350> him<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.010> i<00:03:20.069> did<00:03:20.340> enjoy<00:03:20.459> use

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
