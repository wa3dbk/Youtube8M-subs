when he cuts inside guys and I have some
very<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.360> evidence<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:28.380> him<00:01:28.530> cutting

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
very good evidence about him cutting

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
very good evidence about him cutting
inside<00:01:29.070> being<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> right<00:01:29.729> wing<00:01:29.909> when<00:01:30.329> he

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
inside being on the right wing when he

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
inside being on the right wing when he
does<00:01:30.570> cut<00:01:30.750> inside<00:01:30.990> he<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> use<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> left

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
does cut inside he can use that left

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.010
