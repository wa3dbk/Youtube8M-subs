00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.840
 stupid 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.970
 So 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.390
 and this here 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.450
 and paint it all so 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.050
 so first 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.260
 daughter 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.980

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.519

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.519
 not that we have not yet 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.820
 now i'll shoot all the colors 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.600
 but on top I 'll just take a little 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.250
 because I can't do anymore 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.699
 I recently learned to paint 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:06.979
 what is photoshop and that's what i just 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:16.400
 I can do this, I did it, but you 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:22.330
 can be different so we all 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.330
 did for me so then the image and 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.960
 layers and merge all layers 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:40.599
 connect we will see the layers and they are all ours 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:46.580
 vision mode yes all I have and flowers all 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:52.909
 then save as I am because 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:58.729
 I do how to say to demonstrate to you 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:06:00.849
 I see everything 8 bits and again we go into this 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.130
 my program did not fold 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:08.570
 import and what we have just done through 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.430
 Photoshop does not go and that's what 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:16.670
 I am now just a matter of this 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:20.300
 it turned out terribly just okay 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:25.160
 about how to save push them 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:37.520
 textures and fat fashion and then here you can 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:39.590
 write so nexus and all here is this folder 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:48.710
 throw this folder 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:51.290
 in the manastir and so the player and here is a bite with this 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.510

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:57.520
