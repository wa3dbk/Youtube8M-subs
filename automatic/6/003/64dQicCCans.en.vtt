00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
flat shape make sure it is of the right

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.620 
flat shape make sure it is of the right
size<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.650> proportion<00:02:30.850> before<00:02:31.850> getting<00:02:32.450> into

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
size and proportion before getting into

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.880 
size and proportion before getting into
the<00:02:32.900> details<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.950> making<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.550> fingers<00:02:34.970> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the details like making the fingers I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.440 
the details like making the fingers I
often<00:02:36.890> make<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.100> line<00:02:37.430> where<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.820> knuckles<00:02:38.180> go

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
often make a line where the knuckles go

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.810 
often make a line where the knuckles go
that<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.260> where<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.890> fingers<00:02:40.310> are<00:02:40.519> going<00:02:40.700> to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
that is where the fingers are going to

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.910 
that is where the fingers are going to
fold

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.640 

so<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.950> sketched<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.760> outline<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:47.599> in<00:02:48.500> this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
so I sketched the outline and in this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.830 
so I sketched the outline and in this
particular<00:02:49.250> case<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.760> didn't<00:02:50.060> actually<00:02:50.239> draw

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
particular case I didn't actually draw

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.309 
particular case I didn't actually draw
the<00:02:50.900> knuckles<00:02:51.230> line<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.129> did<00:02:52.519> visualize<00:02:53.209> it

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
the knuckles line but I did visualize it

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:08.130 
the knuckles line but I did visualize it
before<00:02:54.319> drawing<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:55.099> fingers

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.459 

then<00:03:09.140> if<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.219> hand<00:03:10.519> looks<00:03:10.879> correct<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:11.719> give<00:03:12.319> it

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
then if the hand looks correct I give it

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.410 
then if the hand looks correct I give it
more<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.040> more<00:03:13.099> detail

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.300 

finally<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.599> start<00:03:18.109> shading

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.290 

for<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.880> use<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.990> length<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:25.580> 6b

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
for this I use a to be length and a 6b

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.550 
for this I use a to be length and a 6b
for<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.960> very<00:03:27.290> ducks<00:03:28.510> for<00:03:29.510> sketching<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.350> for

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
for the very ducks for sketching and for

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.280 
for the very ducks for sketching and for
the<00:03:30.740> light<00:03:30.980> shadows<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.940> am<00:03:32.330> using<00:03:32.750> an<00:03:33.050> H

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
the light shadows I am using an H

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.570 
the light shadows I am using an H
I<00:03:36.690> shed<00:03:37.690> little<00:03:38.200> by<00:03:38.290> little<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.920> render<00:03:39.340> them

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
I shed little by little to render them

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.229 
I shed little by little to render them
volumes<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.890> almost<00:03:42.220> like<00:03:42.370> sculpting

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
volumes this is almost like sculpting

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.580 
volumes this is almost like sculpting
the<00:03:43.420> shapes

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.770 

i<00:03:52.770> smote<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:54.099> graphite<00:03:54.550> with<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.360> soft

i smote the graphite with a soft

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.520 
i smote the graphite with a soft
synthetic<00:03:56.620> brush

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.720 

I<00:04:01.850> make<00:04:02.850> my<00:04:03.030> way<00:04:03.330> by<00:04:03.570> shading<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.470> giving<00:04:05.460> more

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
I make my way by shading and giving more

I make my way by shading and giving more

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:24.580 

I<00:04:20.980> am<00:04:21.980> shading<00:04:22.310> in<00:04:22.610> different<00:04:23.120> directions<00:04:23.590> for

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.949 

idly<00:04:47.709> need<00:04:48.069> some<00:04:48.339> specific<00:04:48.639> parts<00:04:49.449> that<00:04:49.929> I

wings<00:05:42.460> I<00:05:44.460> first<00:05:45.460> sketched<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.510> outline<00:05:47.110> and

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
wings I first sketched the outline and

00:05:47.410 --> 00:06:09.590 
wings I first sketched the outline and
then<00:05:48.280> some<00:05:48.610> feathers<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.630> rows

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.140 

to<00:06:10.600> break<00:06:10.840> up<00:06:11.080> monotony<00:06:11.800> I'm<00:06:12.100> going<00:06:12.820> to<00:06:12.940> make<00:06:13.120> a

to break up monotony I'm going to make a

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.570 
to break up monotony I'm going to make a
missing<00:06:13.870> feather<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:17.320> I<00:06:17.470> give<00:06:17.740> it<00:06:17.890> a<00:06:18.040> fairly

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
missing feather and I give it a fairly

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.870 
missing feather and I give it a fairly
even<00:06:18.790> background<00:06:19.600> which<00:06:20.200> I<00:06:20.410> then<00:06:20.680> smudge<00:06:21.190> with

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
even background which I then smudge with

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.470 
even background which I then smudge with
the<00:06:22.030> brush

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.800 

and<00:06:24.570> with<00:06:25.410> the<00:06:25.560> kneaded<00:06:25.980> eraser<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:26.760> pull<00:06:27.570> some

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
and with the kneaded eraser I pull some

and with the kneaded eraser I pull some
lights<00:06:28.610> this<00:06:29.610> gives<00:06:30.090> nice<00:06:30.510> volumes

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.440 

I<00:06:44.530> used<00:06:45.530> a<00:06:45.710> graphite<00:06:46.160> powder<00:06:46.490> from<00:06:47.030> when<00:06:47.240> I

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
I used a graphite powder from when I

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.350 
I used a graphite powder from when I
sharpened<00:06:47.960> the<00:06:48.080> lens<00:06:48.290> to<00:06:49.070> charge<00:06:49.430> the<00:06:50.060> brush

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
sharpened the lens to charge the brush

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.080 
sharpened the lens to charge the brush
and<00:06:50.810> salt<00:06:51.740> darken<00:06:52.340> the<00:06:52.490> background

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.350 

I<00:06:55.440> go<00:06:56.440> over<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:56.860> figure<00:06:57.280> as<00:06:57.520> well<00:06:57.580> to

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
I go over the figure as well to

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.680 
I go over the figure as well to
integrate<00:06:58.870> it<00:06:59.080> and<00:06:59.490> over<00:07:00.490> the<00:07:00.670> wings<00:07:00.940> to<00:07:01.450> give

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
integrate it and over the wings to give

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.940 
integrate it and over the wings to give
them<00:07:01.870> a<00:07:02.020> tone<00:07:03.510> this<00:07:04.510> allows<00:07:04.930> me<00:07:05.170> to<00:07:05.350> give<00:07:05.590> light

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 
them a tone this allows me to give light

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:14.620 
them a tone this allows me to give light
accents<00:07:06.700> to<00:07:07.180> some<00:07:07.420> feathers

you

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.480

I<00:07:17.170> didn't<00:07:18.170> smudge<00:07:18.530> and<00:07:18.740> integrate<00:07:19.250> them<00:07:19.460> with

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
I didn't smudge and integrate them with

I didn't smudge and integrate them with
the<00:07:19.760> brush<00:07:19.970> and<00:07:21.400> then<00:07:22.400> I<00:07:22.610> reestablish<00:07:23.540> the
