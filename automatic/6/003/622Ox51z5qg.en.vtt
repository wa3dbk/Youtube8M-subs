00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
across the top right same thing goes for

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
across the top right same thing goes for
the<00:01:24.600> rest<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.470> take<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> look<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
flag that goes into a step now that's an

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.710 
flag that goes into a step now that's an
eighth<00:01:32.100> note<00:01:32.189> rest<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> sixteenth<00:01:33.180> rest<00:01:33.509> we

sixteenth note rests now based on the

sixteenth note rests now based on the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
same principles as the eighth rest we

same principles as the eighth rest we
already<00:02:15.720> talked<00:02:15.990> about<00:02:16.050> what<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.380> going<00:02:16.410> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
already talked about what it's going to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.380 
already talked about what it's going to
look<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:16.710> that's<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.280> guy<00:02:17.460> right<00:02:17.490> there<00:02:17.700> we

look like that's the guy right there we
have<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> last<00:02:18.870> half<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> bar<00:02:19.590> being<00:02:19.770> all

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010

have the last half of the bar being all
sixteenth<00:02:20.490> arrests<00:02:20.940> again<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.720> isn't<00:02:22.050> how

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
sixteenth arrests again this isn't how

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.810 
sixteenth arrests again this isn't how
we<00:02:22.170> would<00:02:22.410> normally<00:02:22.560> write<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.760> two

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
we would normally write you know two

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.150 
we would normally write you know two
quarter<00:02:24.300> notes<00:02:24.330> worth<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.870> nothing<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
quarter notes worth of nothing but to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.470 
quarter notes worth of nothing but to
give<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.459> idea<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.790> what<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.060> look<00:02:27.240> like<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
give the idea of what they look like and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.330 
give the idea of what they look like and
so<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.080> see<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.470> mover<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
so you can really see it mover in it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:42.340 
so you can really see it mover in it
this<00:02:29.459> way<00:02:29.640> let's<00:02:30.180> hear<00:02:30.330> example<00:02:30.810> number<00:02:30.900> three

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
by now i'm sure you have a really good

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.420 
by now i'm sure you have a really good
idea<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.239> how<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:45.900> works<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.620> let's<00:02:46.890> take

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
idea of how this all works so let's take

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.420 
idea of how this all works so let's take
a<00:02:47.459> bar<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> we're<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> incorporate<00:02:49.920> two

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
a bar and we're going to incorporate two

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.500 
a bar and we're going to incorporate two
of<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> rests<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.120> already<00:02:51.330> talked

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
of the rests that we already talked

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.330 
of the rests that we already talked
about<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.900> 16th<00:02:52.290> arrest<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.860> eighth<00:02:53.040> note

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
about the 16th arrest in the eighth note

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.540 
about the 16th arrest in the eighth note
rests<00:02:53.730> into<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> single<00:02:54.750> example<00:02:55.340> first<00:02:56.340> we're

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
rests into a single example first we're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.650 
rests into a single example first we're
going<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.700> play<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.880> on<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.060> snare<00:02:57.300> drum<00:02:57.510> at
