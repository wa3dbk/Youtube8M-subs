00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.730
 To compete in the cashier I have said as I where the games myself 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.730

 Glock by one a European Polak or French simple 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.999
 American because in the end but rewarded and faster and so winning opportunities 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.500
 So our first stop then if I just set empty turn up here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 you see the low numbers are percent or in the numbers shown 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.400

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.460
 Shown in green 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 so of course not so long without putting it is really five times in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 episode 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 a number has come 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.200
 and 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.360
 if these then 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.150
 so happened at St 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.890
 her for example from Parkour brought Jakobshalle saas-markt light color 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.600
 is announced and times in a row and the color red are a euro black 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.560
 and then on pipes 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.440
 Worrying would be from a clique of songs so long until everyone here five times 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 in consequence Grote came and turned to red-black 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 van Hoorn 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.500
 then everyone goes on 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.180
 and I did not find it any different but I turn to Meier 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 came as a result of a woman 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.260
 You can even go six times even safer 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 Manchester's troublesome opportunity house 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 fast earned money with a few mouse clicks from home bank 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.850
 recognize 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.860
 and I'm ready for that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.940
 a little more often to click my mouse button 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.960
 sometimes it takes a long time to come back sometimes it goes faster 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.700
 now only four have five black in a row 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.570
 Euro Roth 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.130
 like a mockery 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.030
 overjoyed now still show that it is not always super happens here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.070
 over again Â»Pohl Schwarz on red-red 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.940
 then works 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 I do not want to say that is not always as smooth as it is now 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.009
 accommodated agreed 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.820
 because I wanted to finally show that with the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.369
 double works 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.919
 that's what it's like when you pick up something and show it 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:30.259
 Yonhap Kazakhmys so five times for danger as one-euro- Roth yes black so 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.639
 and now double the double of the full commitment so two euros 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.689
 necessary 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.049
 not worked again 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.549
 all double four euros 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.420
 and red and without any scorn if you won so much 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.429
 make the first bet and that has a euro 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.999
 I stop as I said at 8 EUR on the loss does not raise but only 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.529
 That's because this strategy is played by four casinos 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.959
 and take Almerares at ten to fifteen minutes in the morning 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.789
 tried to deviate from what is disciplined here again you come 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.369
 Follow Black then threatens 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.869
 and repeat 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:09.119
 and so on and Lisa knew the car's instructions by choosing Fabian 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.449
 gambling I came up with the idea to place big sums because that 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.420
 lolls him 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.589

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:20.159
