00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
alright so we've been talking about the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.169 
alright so we've been talking about the
chromatic<00:00:07.350> scale<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.850> its<00:00:08.850> applications<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
chromatic scale and its applications and

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.430 
chromatic scale and its applications and
guys<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.389> been<00:00:12.510> battering<00:00:12.870> back<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.260> forth

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
and you know the correct way to finger

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.220 
and you know the correct way to finger
in<00:00:17.099> you<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:17.970> people<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.540> been<00:00:18.779> trying<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
ask me to explain why you need all these

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.790 
ask me to explain why you need all these
other<00:00:21.840> fingerings<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.650> there's<00:00:22.770> only

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
other fingerings for it if there's only

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
other fingerings for it if there's only
one<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.220> works<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.550> again<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.630> try<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
one that works and again I try to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.269 
one that works and again I try to
reiterate<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.529> know<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> reason<00:00:26.130> for

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
reiterate that you know the reason for

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.980 
reiterate that you know the reason for
all<00:00:26.310> these<00:00:26.699> exercises<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> guys<00:00:27.779> can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
all these exercises so you guys can

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
all these exercises so you guys can
learn<00:00:28.109> how<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> move<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.119> but

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
learn how to move and so to you now but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.790 
learn how to move and so to you now but
you<00:00:30.599> know<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> guys<00:00:30.930> are<00:00:31.140> playing<00:00:31.470> mostly

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you know you guys are playing mostly

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250 
you know you guys are playing mostly
metal<00:00:32.099> stuff<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.180> metal<00:00:33.540> stuff<00:00:33.750> doesn't<00:00:34.110> use

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
metal stuff so metal stuff doesn't use

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.190 
metal stuff so metal stuff doesn't use
chromatic<00:00:34.680> scales<00:00:34.890> very<00:00:34.980> much<00:00:35.280> very<00:00:35.309> rarely

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
chromatic scales very much very rarely

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.150 
chromatic scales very much very rarely
have<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.290> heard<00:00:37.440> chromatic<00:00:37.739> scales<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> only

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
have I heard chromatic scales the only

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
have I heard chromatic scales the only
guy<00:00:38.280> who<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.520> knows<00:00:38.730> how<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> put<00:00:39.690> well<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
guy who really knows how to put well a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
guy who really knows how to put well a
couple<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> guys<00:00:40.829> who<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.550> chromatic

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
couple of guys who really put chromatic

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.260 
couple of guys who really put chromatic
scales<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.450> metal<00:00:43.280> sparingly<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.640> Joe

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
scales in metal sparingly and that's Joe

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.340 
scales in metal sparingly and that's Joe
Satriani<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.379> Steve<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:48.270> dabble<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Satriani and Steve I and they dabble a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.479 
Satriani and Steve I and they dabble a
little<00:00:49.379> bit<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.920> course<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
little bit of course they know the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.260 
little bit of course they know the
chromatic<00:00:50.789> scale<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.090> well<00:00:51.180> especially

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
chromatic scale really well especially

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.279 
chromatic scale really well especially
Joe<00:00:51.629> Satriani<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.820> play

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
Joe Satriani but they don't really play

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.240 
Joe Satriani but they don't really play
chromatic<00:00:55.289> lines<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:55.860> much<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> music

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
chromatic lines too much of the music

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
chromatic lines too much of the music
now<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> other<00:00:57.059> hand<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:57.600> I'd

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
now on the other hand of you think I'd

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.080 
now on the other hand of you think I'd
like<00:00:57.840> holes<00:00:58.079> where<00:00:58.320> they're<00:00:58.440> mikester<00:00:59.090> Robben

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
like holes where they're mikester Robben

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
like holes where they're mikester Robben
Ford<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.660> mccloughan<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.350> any<00:01:01.469> other<00:01:01.649> more

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
Ford or mccloughan or any other more

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.279 
Ford or mccloughan or any other more
fugitive<00:01:02.399> players<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.750> dial<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.259> that

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
fugitive players and they dial in that

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.350 
fugitive players and they dial in that
chromatic<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> show<00:01:06.300> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
chromatic so I'm just going to show you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.690 
chromatic so I'm just going to show you
guys<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> chromatic<00:01:08.400> scale

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
guys how you can use the chromatic scale

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.690 
guys how you can use the chromatic scale
in<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:10.049> soloing<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.310> does<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
in you're soloing and what it does is it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.630 
in you're soloing and what it does is it
adds<00:01:11.970> tension<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:14.100> lines<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
adds tension to what your lines are I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
adds tension to what your lines are I
mean<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.140> feel<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
mean you can really really feel the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.890 
mean you can really really feel the
tension<00:01:16.950> when<00:01:17.010> you<00:01:17.130> add<00:01:17.310> chromatic<00:01:17.909> notes<00:01:18.150> but

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
tension when you add chromatic notes but

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.789 
tension when you add chromatic notes but
you<00:01:19.020> gotta<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.350> you're<00:01:19.380> doing<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> got

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you gotta know what you're doing you got

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.840 
you gotta know what you're doing you got
to<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.009> how<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.400> away<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to know how to back away from the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
to know how to back away from the
chromatic<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.390> back<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.500> know

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
chromatic and go back to the you know

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.640 
chromatic and go back to the you know
the<00:01:22.710> inky<00:01:23.100> diatonic<00:01:23.610> notes<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.229> just

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the inky diatonic notes so this is just

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.140 
the inky diatonic notes so this is just
a<00:01:25.799> groove<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.090> minor<00:01:27.420> 7<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> we're

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
a groove it's just a minor 7 so we're

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.530 
a groove it's just a minor 7 so we're
gonna<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.479> minor<00:01:30.720> pentatonic<00:01:30.960> scale<00:01:35.540> okay

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
gonna use a minor pentatonic scale okay

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.319 
gonna use a minor pentatonic scale okay
and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.320> course<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> minor<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and then of course this is a minor so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.340 
and then of course this is a minor so
you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> minor<00:01:39.960> scale

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.880 

whatever<00:01:46.350> fingering<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.800> want<00:01:47.010> with<00:01:47.160> that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.740 

and<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.820> there's<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.150> lot<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> mode<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and you know there's a lot of mode you

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.050
