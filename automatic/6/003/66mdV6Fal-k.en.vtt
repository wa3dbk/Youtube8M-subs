relieve room for the new bearing carrier
the<00:01:21.229> bearing<00:01:21.500> carrier<00:01:21.829> here<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.130> different

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
the bearing carrier here is different

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.100 
the bearing carrier here is different
than<00:01:23.420> 85

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.440 

you<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:27.260> tell<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.980> chain<00:01:28.250> adjuster<00:01:28.450> is

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
you can tell the chain adjuster is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.930 
you can tell the chain adjuster is
different<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.460> comes<00:01:31.670> out<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.820> little

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
different and it comes out a little

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.730 
different and it comes out a little
further<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.510> it's<00:01:32.630> going<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.840> need<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.260> little

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
further so it's going to need a little

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.890 
further so it's going to need a little
more<00:01:33.860> clearance<00:01:34.340> than<00:01:35.060> was<00:01:35.240> allowed<00:01:35.540> for<00:01:35.570> the
