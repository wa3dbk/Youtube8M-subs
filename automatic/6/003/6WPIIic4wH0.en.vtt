after turning the battery charger on the
following<00:02:32.750> items<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.230> be<00:02:33.260> programmed

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
following items can be programmed

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.790 
following items can be programmed
voltage<00:02:35.390> current<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.410> time<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:39.440> can<00:02:39.590> also

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
voltage current and time you can also

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.480 
voltage current and time you can also
use<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.460> list<00:02:40.910> program<00:02:41.740> for<00:02:42.740> step<00:02:43.010> charging

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
use the I list program for step charging

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
use the I list program for step charging
up<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.900> sixteen<00:02:45.380> steps<00:02:45.710> can<00:02:46.070> be<00:02:46.220> used<00:02:46.550> each

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
up to sixteen steps can be used each

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.690 
up to sixteen steps can be used each
step<00:02:47.900> can<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.320> its<00:02:48.470> own<00:02:48.620> individual<00:02:49.250> voltage

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
step can have its own individual voltage

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.200 
step can have its own individual voltage
current<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.330> time<00:02:50.720> level<00:02:51.580> over<00:02:52.580> voltage<00:02:52.970> can

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
current and time level over voltage can

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.070 
current and time level over voltage can
also<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.750> programmed<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:55.060> also<00:02:56.060> profiles<00:02:56.840> can

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
also be programmed and also profiles can

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.740 
also be programmed and also profiles can
be<00:02:57.140> saved<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.480> different

profile<00:03:02.720> can<00:03:02.900> be<00:03:02.930> put<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.380> battery

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
profile can be put in this battery

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.920 
profile can be put in this battery
charger<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.030> do<00:03:05.150> not<00:03:05.270> have<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.780> go

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
charger so that you do not have to go

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.620 
charger so that you do not have to go
through<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.550> sequencing<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.730> programming

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
through the sequencing of programming

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.980 
through the sequencing of programming
again<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.530> can<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:09.770> recall<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.540> profile

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
again you can just recall the profile

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.420 
again you can just recall the profile
and<00:03:12.260> charge<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.310> battery<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:16.100> total
