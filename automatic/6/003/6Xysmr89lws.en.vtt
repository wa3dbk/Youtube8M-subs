their home or something like that you
know<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.539> right<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.050> typically<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
know but I think right now typically a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.000 
know but I think right now typically a
lot<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.210> writers<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.170> generation<00:00:49.379> our

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
lot of writers from my generation our

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.319 
lot of writers from my generation our
fan<00:00:50.340> base<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.789> usually<00:00:51.180> pretty<00:00:51.390> broke<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
fan base is usually pretty broke and

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
fan base is usually pretty broke and
they<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.510> always<00:00:54.719> buy<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> things<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.620> are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
they can always buy the things that are

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.369 
they can always buy the things that are
under<00:00:55.980> thirty<00:00:56.190> dollars<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.199> that's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
under thirty dollars but I think that's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
under thirty dollars but I think that's
okay<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.489> we'll<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.879> 10<00:01:00.090> years

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
think with our crew I don't think we try

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.890 
think with our crew I don't think we try
to<00:02:26.540> paint<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:27.110> crew<00:02:27.470> style<00:02:27.860> i'd<00:02:28.190> i<00:02:28.599> would<00:02:29.599> like

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
to paint a crew style i'd i would like

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.619 
to paint a crew style i'd i would like
to<00:02:30.049> think<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.379> we're<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:31.120> very<00:02:32.120> strong

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
to think that we're all very strong

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.289 
to think that we're all very strong
individuals<00:02:33.349> with<00:02:33.680> differing<00:02:34.579> opinions<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
individuals with differing opinions and

00:02:35.299 --> 00:03:00.010 
individuals with differing opinions and
stuff<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:35.660> that

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.590 

no<00:03:01.020> we<00:03:01.200> do<00:03:01.350> think<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.940> similar<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.240> certain

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
no we do think it's similar on certain

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.830 
no we do think it's similar on certain
things<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.680> think<00:03:05.550> from<00:03:06.180> artist<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.810> artist

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
things I think from artist to artist

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.770 
things I think from artist to artist
within<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.710> msk<00:03:08.220> crew<00:03:08.550> were<00:03:08.760> very<00:03:09.570> much

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.910 
within the msk crew were very much
individuals<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.800> have<00:03:11.550> very<00:03:11.790> strong<00:03:12.920> you

in<00:03:20.040> my<00:03:20.160> career<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:21.230> think<00:03:22.230> that's<00:03:22.590> really

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
in my career I think that's really

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:45.410 
in my career I think that's really
important<00:03:43.550> describe<00:03:44.550> your<00:03:44.640> own<00:03:44.850> slide<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.330> if

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
important describe your own slide and if

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.010 
important describe your own slide and if
you<00:03:45.540> would<00:03:46.190> well<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.220> i<00:03:47.460> think<00:03:47.970> i<00:03:48.210> think<00:03:48.630> my

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
you would well I i think i think my

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.090 
you would well I i think i think my
style<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.770> based<00:03:50.130> off<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:51.710> coming<00:03:52.710> up<00:03:52.770> over<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
style is based off of coming up over the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.330 
style is based off of coming up over the
years<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.610> never<00:03:53.700> really<00:03:53.940> being<00:03:54.330> satisfied

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
years and never really being satisfied
