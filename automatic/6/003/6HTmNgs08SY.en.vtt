00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.350
 I actually have two statements in store and what's next? 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.840
 so i could do that 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.179
 with witnesses 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.549
 does it say adults 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.549
 and of course I go and sleep more 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.449
 Jessica Hardy Immediately Not Another 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.910
 it was blowing 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.700
 I know why a lot of options but it was good not to stop 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.780
 so just 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.010
 one that many of course know the most from mine 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.480
 scientific books 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 always 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 the snackbar 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.290
 that died two years ago 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 and how the game this year 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.200
 I then lost much nicer difficult times 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.660
 we are but true 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.280
 and ajax 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 very difficult moments 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.270
 9 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.800
 unbelievable that problem 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.180
 now it starts 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.000
 but the truth 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 nienke and we could have been there 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.850
 and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 quickly gone through the service 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 I have ... myself 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.420
 we have known i saw today 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.780
 Of course that is really true yes I did that myself on 9 March at the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.869
 owner Mia Linda 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.780
 winter incidents for example with a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.920
 so also the cupboards are walking around 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.909
 I have had to endure that as well as usual, I don't have it all 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.829
 experienced 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.829
 I had to abandon my studies 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:17.299
 24 duels twice in a few weeks 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.209
 it is purely for economic reasons 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.479
 So 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.259
 also walked a shelter he had been in the arm for ages 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.399
 we stand behind the theft 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.039
 moving away 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.819
 its editors 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.199
 the hague and then you have to go one too far 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.619
 are you then he still had one and a half seconds 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:45.619
 not to always go through cheering audiences 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.259
 7 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.709
 now there will be a jury mix 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.979
 scientific book 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.259
 leave them in that context 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:03.619
 good plan also the largest volendam 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.619
 but you are actually looking out of a country 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.519
 not my biggest telecom 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.989
 and who I am and services but yes he is nice and big and fat 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.169
 yes i will go here 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.599
 seen the crosscup okada m 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.599
 the ecb normal 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.279
 unibet against bad thought that you have work of course 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.960
 the Zuidas and those documents 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.949
 great 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.339
 the attacker seemed again since lasall year 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.369
 it literally says 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.549
 win everything 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.829
 with all the most important ambition 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.159
 of course sat 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.049
 he drove a reasonable business and studying terrain all 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.880
 that is mainly due to a series of skills 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.729
 the 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.789
 christine's study is points 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:09.469
 astronomers that is a wide range an ebook together a fun in it 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.099
 economy I am also a strong at it 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.289
 a 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.779
 of theology through natural progression 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.239
 meteorologists 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.009
 the other 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.089
 brands can say that turkey is theology 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.590
 that is 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.830
 one may argue a bit of everything really is already very expensive 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.539
 that is 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.360
 meanwhile this year i know fine still with so i can get there 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 unfortunately not at says matthieu sprick of course yes in a lot of strength yes me 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.789
 don't know what I'm going to vote makes trendy 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.110
 so just as good making offer now full year this was very simple 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.350
 it is still unclear how do you prevent with 110 km that is it 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.150
 main 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.770
 The main thing at the time was her shoulder, so of course we have to go 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.689
 household chores 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.689
 he finds it annoying that this has succeeded 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.180
 but not for me you have an interesting player 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.229
 unique and tno physically large table a here of course we go that 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.259
 small table
