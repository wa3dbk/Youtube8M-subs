today<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.289> thought<00:00:16.650> I'd<00:00:16.800> used<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.190> laser<00:00:17.400> sight

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
today I thought I'd used a laser sight

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
today I thought I'd used a laser sight
on<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.029> PDW<00:00:18.630> now<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> reason<00:00:19.320> why<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
on the PDW now the reason why that's a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349 
on the PDW now the reason why that's a
little<00:00:20.130> bit<00:00:20.250> different<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.760> me<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
little bit different for me is because I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.269 
little bit different for me is because I
usually<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.260> rock<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> PDW<00:00:23.160> with

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
usually like to rock the PDW with

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
suppressor and fast mag not usually

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.109 
suppressor and fast mag not usually
laser<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.949> suppressive<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.939> been

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
laser and suppressive because I've been

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.490 
laser and suppressive because I've been
hearing<00:00:27.390> some<00:00:27.539> rumors<00:00:27.599> about<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> laser

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
hearing some rumors about the laser

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500

bringing<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.460> gun<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:30.150> faster

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
bringing up your gun a little bit faster

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.089 
bringing up your gun a little bit faster
than<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.779> regularly<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
than you regularly would have if you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
than you regularly would have if you
weren't<00:00:32.279> using<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> laser<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> thought<00:00:33.719> I'd

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
weren't using a laser so I thought I'd

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.360 
weren't using a laser so I thought I'd
try<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.260> switch<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> little<00:00:35.190> bit

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
try it out switch it up for a little bit

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
something like that or I should just

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.300 
something like that or I should just

only care about the people who you think
their<00:03:17.490> opinion<00:03:17.850> matters<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.420> some

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
their opinion matters if it's some

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.050 
their opinion matters if it's some
random<00:03:18.630> guy<00:03:19.140> his<00:03:19.590> opinion<00:03:20.220> probably<00:03:20.489> doesn't

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
random guy his opinion probably doesn't

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.400 
random guy his opinion probably doesn't
really<00:03:21.209> matter<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.750> even<00:03:22.019> when<00:03:22.050> it's<00:03:22.350> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
really matter to you even when it's a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.750 
really matter to you even when it's a
good<00:03:22.590> opinion<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:23.040> mean<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.310> course<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.640> matters

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
good opinion I mean of course it matters

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
good opinion I mean of course it matters
a<00:03:23.970> little<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.630> then<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.320> even<00:03:25.440> if

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
a little bit to you then but even if

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.050 
a little bit to you then but even if
it's<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.860> bad<00:03:26.040> opinion<00:03:26.280> probably<00:03:26.700> still

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it's a bad opinion probably still

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's a bad opinion probably still
doesn't<00:03:27.360> matter<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.500> that's

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
doesn't matter to you then so that's

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.009 
doesn't matter to you then so that's
what<00:03:29.370> my<00:03:29.580> opinion<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.269> hating<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:30.870> my

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
what my opinion is on hating and in my

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.300 
what my opinion is on hating and in my
opinion<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:31.800> think<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.070> it's

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
opinion I really think that it's

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070 
opinion I really think that it's
something<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.760> needs<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.090> stop<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.630> really

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
something that needs to stop it really

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.050

does<00:03:34.260> guys<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.739> really<00:03:34.769> needs<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.250> stop<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.820> know
