00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello viewers of the duster pocket mine 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 new tekkit tutorial I am staring at 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.700
 top of the volcano as you see then 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 watch you take this is a very big one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 weird shaped 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.139
 volcano and what i am going to do i go and chio 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 dermal generate i'm going to you 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.619
 show how you can get energy 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.900
 of lava and that is a very efficient and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 handy way to gain energy 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.769
 What you need 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 germ on generate u naturally a tree 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.939
 and furious rise barking furiously 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.099
 waterproof ip 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 cobussen what I fight engine for 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.620
 or became his engine of my networks and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 you used in bed box and liver and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 glass fiber cable 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 So the first thing we are going to do is we 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 the pumps go right above the drawer 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 source put the bars source goes 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.480
 all the way down so there is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.730
 against him 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.059
 then that power must get so you turn 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.199
 the rat engines hit this way 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.270
 Then you have to make sure you have an extra 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.230
 place you have so you can put letters on it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.059
 put 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 well in this case what we are going to do is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.939
 we are going to put this waterproof byte on it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.729
 Connecting let through and we 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.320
 now we can do they can we can do the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.540
 what I keep connecting to the tank so that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.619
 the lava comes in the tank but whatever we do 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.570
 can do 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.549
 first we can do it in the chio term 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.049
 so generate the geothermal energy 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.600
 generate between here yes he is 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.890
 connected to that draws the la dad 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.070
 all in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 well what this does that puts the energy on 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.549
 the lava into energy in an hour so if 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 if you put it in a bedbox against az, it will go like that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.790
 it's okay 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.650
 they can produce energy with one 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.190
 gloss fire basement off 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.350
 and boxing the bed and then connecting 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 so let's start pumping and turning on 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.730
 put some leffers here 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.430
 redstone and jins go 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.360
 takes a very big time you can 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.830
 therefore also 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 Use steam engines if you have those 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 find them nicer that go a little faster 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.780
 but then of course you have cabbage 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.310
 so need a packet of the cabbage whites that I like 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.110
 just connect a few 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 steam and you saan just to show 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.869
 that you can 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.959
 so we grab some coal but it's cool 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.120
 you just do it okay that's already possible 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.770
 the lava sees that much faster 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.170
 sankyo slowly by no nothing it yet 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.110
 a person things to go slowly 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.910
 until the journal generator ' 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.380
 is achieved 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.360
 and there you get some weird 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.060
 sound I don't know if you hear that 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.790
 I turn red in case I do 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.220
 and then it comes in and finally then 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.180
 it comes in the box and so you see 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.730
 very simple energy does not cost huge 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.640
 a lot that costs a few course items 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.269
 but just you already have nice setup and like you 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.330
 see 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.980
 Fills the bed box quickly so efficiently 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.090
 way to get energy thanks 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.380
 for looking don't forget a good one 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.060
 Nude leave 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.200
 Subscribe Subscribe to the charms was so 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.519
 he on games and I see you the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.700
 next time 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.700
 yo
