00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
about three to four hundred times and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.650 
about three to four hundred times and
for<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.730> person<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.180> sounds<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> lot

for one person that sounds like a lot
and<00:00:42.870> even<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.260> team<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.590> four<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.070> things

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and even for a team of four I things

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.250 
and even for a team of four I things
like<00:00:45.360> locks<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.140> 100<00:00:46.559> each<00:00:48.260> basically

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
like locks so like 100 each basically

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
like locks so like 100 each basically
you've<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> hit<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.739> enough<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.700> can

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you've got to hit it enough so it can

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
you've got to hit it enough so it can
launch<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.270> straight<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.860> land

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
launch you straight up then you can land

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.080 
launch you straight up then you can land
on<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> wing<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> airplane<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:56.090> I've

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
on the wing of the airplane and I've

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
on the wing of the airplane and I've
already<00:00:57.660> been<00:00:57.930> hitting<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> lot<00:00:58.620> before<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
already been hitting it a lot before I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.670 
already been hitting it a lot before I
started<00:00:59.789> recording<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.570> because<00:01:01.530> I'm

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
started recording and because I'm

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
started recording and because I'm
playing<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.010> balls<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> moment<00:01:02.789> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
playing with balls at the moment that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.270 
playing with balls at the moment that
they<00:01:03.930> couldn't<00:01:04.530> hit<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.979> me<00:01:05.070> sort<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
they couldn't hit it for me sort of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
they couldn't hit it for me sort of
techne<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.850> they've<00:01:06.000> five<00:01:06.270> minutes<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
techne so like they've five minutes I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.859 
techne so like they've five minutes I
reckon<00:01:08.299> what<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.810> want

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
reckon what you want to do is you want

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
reckon what you want to do is you want
to<00:01:10.049> jump<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> back<00:01:10.710> part<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.369> minigun

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to jump on the back part of the minigun

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.750 
to jump on the back part of the minigun
because<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> jump<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> front<00:01:13.650> /<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
because if you jump on the front / the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
because if you jump on the front / the
barrels<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.720> launch<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
barrels it will launch you way over in

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.789 
barrels it will launch you way over in
the<00:01:17.640> distance<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.470> straight

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the distance and you want to go straight

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.390 
the distance and you want to go straight
up<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.240> got<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> hit<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.720> lot<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.400> then

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
up so you got to hit it a lot and then

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.859 
up so you got to hit it a lot and then
you<00:01:23.460> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.640> run<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> from<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> sort<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you want to run it from this sort of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
you want to run it from this sort of
angle<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:26.810> jump<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.259> said<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> back

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
angle and jump like I said on the back

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
angle and jump like I said on the back
part<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> should<00:01:30.119> launch<00:01:30.390> straight

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
part of it and it should launch straight

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.999 
part of it and it should launch straight
up<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> point<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.020> running<00:01:34.229> merit<00:01:34.740> from

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
up and the point of running merit from

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
up and the point of running merit from
this<00:01:35.369> sort<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.670> angle<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.570> gives<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> enough

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
this sort of angle it gives you enough

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
this sort of angle it gives you enough
momentum<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.040> land<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> wink<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.270> can

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
momentum to land on the wink you can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.780 
momentum to land on the wink you can
jump<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> sandbag<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.890> jump<00:01:41.400> straight<00:01:41.640> on

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
jump on the sandbag and jump straight on

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
jump on the sandbag and jump straight on
top<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.890> but<00:01:43.890> i<00:01:44.299> found<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.869> quite

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
top of it but i found out that quite

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.679 
top of it but i found out that quite
often<00:01:46.860> you'll<00:01:47.220> fall<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.360> back<00:01:48.540> down

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
often you'll fall that right back down

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
often you'll fall that right back down
and<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> lose<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.500> fair<00:01:49.860> amount<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.159> health<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and you lose a fair amount of health so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
and you lose a fair amount of health so
i<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.329> during<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> rapid<00:01:52.290> saw<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> best

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
i think during a rapid saw like the best

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.910 
i think during a rapid saw like the best
option<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.210> launch<00:01:54.689> me<00:01:54.990> straight<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
option they go launch me straight up and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.389 
option they go launch me straight up and
a<00:01:56.670> mountaintop<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> plane<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.860> don't<00:01:59.100> want

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
a mountaintop the plane you don't want

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880 
a mountaintop the plane you don't want
to<00:01:59.520> walk<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> engines<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.259> sort<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to walk on the engines as you sort of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.850 
to walk on the engines as you sort of
just<00:02:01.950> fell<00:02:02.579> through<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.270> also<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> tail<00:02:04.469> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
just fell through and also the tail of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.029 
just fell through and also the tail of
the<00:02:05.009> plane<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.700> also<00:02:05.850> fall<00:02:06.270> through<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
the plane you can also fall through that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
the plane you can also fall through that
so<00:02:08.039> you'll<00:02:08.220> probably<00:02:08.459> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> stay<00:02:09.030> near<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so you'll probably want to stay near the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.400 
so you'll probably want to stay near the
middle<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.950> plane

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
middle of the plane

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
middle of the plane
so<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.800> along<00:02:14.010> wings<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:15.300> smoke<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so if you go along wings as smoke I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.340 
so if you go along wings as smoke I
could<00:02:16.470> pull<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.830> off<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.990> obviously<00:02:18.990> that's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
could pull you off and obviously that's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.270 
could pull you off and obviously that's
not<00:02:19.440> good<00:02:21.170> as<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.319> can<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.500> items<00:02:22.770> are<00:02:22.920> run

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
not good as you can see items are run

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.770 
not good as you can see items are run
towards<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.850> front<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> plane<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
towards the front of the plane and the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.010 
towards the front of the plane and the
long<00:02:25.020> both<00:02:25.500> wings<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.850> tank<00:02:27.240> can<00:02:27.660> actually

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
long both wings the tank can actually

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.550 
long both wings the tank can actually
get<00:02:28.200> up<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.390> like<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:30.720> my<00:02:31.080> video

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
get up here and like with my video

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.270 
get up here and like with my video
tutorial<00:02:32.040> showing<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:33.480> rock<00:02:33.950> with<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
tutorial showing you the rock with the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.699 
tutorial showing you the rock with the
death<00:02:35.580> toll<00:02:35.850> campaign<00:02:36.380> when<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> tank

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
death toll campaign when the tank

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.250 
death toll campaign when the tank
detects<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.610> actually<00:02:38.790> get<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.510> very

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
detects it can actually get to you very

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
detects it can actually get to you very
often<00:02:40.470> what<00:02:40.739> happens<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.400> automatically

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
often what happens is it automatically

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.250 
often what happens is it automatically
dies<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.520> like<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.209> my<00:02:45.260> video

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
dies and like you can see in my video

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.420 
dies and like you can see in my video
where<00:02:46.530> me<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.739> my<00:02:46.860> friends<00:02:47.840> stay<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.430> you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
where me and my friends stay up here you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.729 
where me and my friends stay up here you
can<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.239> only<00:02:51.360> have<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:51.810> tank<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
can see that we only have one tank and

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.740 
can see that we only have one tank and
that's<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.700> first<00:02:53.910> Hank<00:02:54.150> died

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that's because the first Hank died

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.350 
that's because the first Hank died
before<00:02:55.080> even<00:02:55.440> God's<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.340> variety<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> us

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
before even God's was a variety of us

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600 
before even God's was a variety of us
could<00:02:57.600> even<00:02:57.720> shoot<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.980> second<00:02:59.400> tank

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
could even shoot it and the second tank

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.420 
could even shoot it and the second tank
I<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.480> got<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.590> stuck<00:03:02.100> down<00:03:02.400> there

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
I just got so of like stuck down there

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.949 
I just got so of like stuck down there
he<00:03:02.700> was<00:03:02.790> just<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.090> running<00:03:03.570> forwards<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
he was just so like running forwards and

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.890 
he was just so like running forwards and
backwards<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:05.220> stand<00:03:05.550> up<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.730> shoot<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.209> and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
backwards just stand up and shoot it and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.040 
backwards just stand up and shoot it and
I'd<00:03:07.380> recommend<00:03:07.800> for<00:03:08.550> up<00:03:08.640> here<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.269> use<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
I'd recommend for up here that you use a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.550 
I'd recommend for up here that you use a
sniper<00:03:10.470> rifle<00:03:10.790> as<00:03:11.790> first<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.269> all<00:03:12.410> shotgun<00:03:13.410> is

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
sniper rifle as first of all shotgun is

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
sniper rifle as first of all shotgun is
not<00:03:13.709> going<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> be<00:03:13.980> much<00:03:14.250> good<00:03:14.580> because<00:03:14.730> you've

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
not going to be much good because you've

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.990 
not going to be much good because you've
got<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.239> very<00:03:15.630> wide<00:03:15.959> field<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.650> view<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.100> with

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
got a very wide field of view and with

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
got a very wide field of view and with
the<00:03:18.120> assault<00:03:18.450> rifle<00:03:18.739> you've<00:03:19.739> run<00:03:19.920> out<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.070> ammo

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the assault rifle you've run out of ammo

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.020 
the assault rifle you've run out of ammo
very<00:03:20.519> quickly<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.400> I've<00:03:23.489> also<00:03:23.730> noticed

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
very quickly and what I've also noticed

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.060 
very quickly and what I've also noticed
with<00:03:24.420> standing<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.380> lot<00:03:26.040> of

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
with standing up there is a lot of

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.280 
with standing up there is a lot of
zombies<00:03:26.400> they'll<00:03:26.880> run<00:03:27.120> along<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.780> they'll

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
zombies they'll run along and they'll

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.920 
zombies they'll run along and they'll
stop<00:03:28.650> running<00:03:28.980> they'll<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.280> stand<00:03:29.579> still

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
stop running they'll just stand still

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.630 
stop running they'll just stand still
which<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.140> quite<00:03:31.410> strange<00:03:31.709> i<00:03:31.829> think<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:32.190> again

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
which is quite strange i think if again

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.190 
which is quite strange i think if again
because<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> game<00:03:33.239> detects<00:03:33.690> they<00:03:33.959> can

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
because the game detects they can

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.410 
because the game detects they can
actually<00:03:34.560> get<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:37.220> say<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:39.000> makes<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.390> a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
actually get to you say it makes it a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600 
actually get to you say it makes it a
lot<00:03:39.540> easier<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.959> kill<00:03:40.170> them<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.650> also<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.519> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
lot easier to kill them and also if you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.580 
lot easier to kill them and also if you
want<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.790> use<00:03:41.940> pistols<00:03:42.540> as<00:03:42.750> well<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.140> save<00:03:43.350> some

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
want to use pistols as well to save some
