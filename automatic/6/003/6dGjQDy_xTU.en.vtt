your<00:00:28.710> cast<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.519> let<00:00:30.060> me<00:00:30.090> show<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
your cast now let me show you how to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.930 
your cast now let me show you how to
evolve<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> card<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.489> choose<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
evolve the card first you choose the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
evolve the card first you choose the
card<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.480> want<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> evolve<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> then

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
card that you want to evolve and then

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.549 
card that you want to evolve and then
choose<00:00:34.920> an<00:00:35.070> identical<00:00:35.579> card<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.969> evolve

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
choose an identical card to evolve

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.080 
choose an identical card to evolve
evolving<00:00:37.559> meaning<00:00:37.890> you're<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> dick<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.700> do

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
evolving meaning you're a dick on my do

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.630 
evolving meaning you're a dick on my do
cuts<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> main

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
cuts into one and then make the main

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.360 
cuts into one and then make the main
card<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.629> powerful<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.530> terms<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
card as a more powerful in terms of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
card as a more powerful in terms of
statistic<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.570> notice<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.020> graphics<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
statistic you can notice the graphics of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
statistic you can notice the graphics of
this<00:00:47.129> evolve<00:00:48.030> car<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.930> more

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this evolve car is actually much more

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
this evolve car is actually much more
nicer<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.219> evolve<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> four<00:00:51.329> cuts

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
nicer you can evolve up to four cuts

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.709 
nicer you can evolve up to four cuts
into<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> single<00:00:53.039> cut<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> much<00:00:54.570> more

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
into a single cut to make it much more

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.500 
into a single cut to make it much more
powerful<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.469> improve<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.699> reality<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
powerful and improve on the reality of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.099 
powerful and improve on the reality of
the<00:00:58.199> card<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.670> course<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> value

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the card as well and of course the value

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
the card as well and of course the value
of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> card<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.770> improve<00:01:02.160> after<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.090> have

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
of the card will improve after you have

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
of the card will improve after you have
combined<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> cars<00:01:04.379> evolving<00:01:05.280> cuts<00:01:05.580> only

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
combined all the cars evolving cuts only

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
combined all the cars evolving cuts only
combine<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:07.290> identical<00:01:07.920> cars<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.670> there's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
combine two identical cars so there's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
combine two identical cars so there's
another<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> improve<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> cut<00:01:10.890> steady

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
another way to improve on a cut steady

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.820 
another way to improve on a cut steady
state<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.520> by<00:01:11.909> enhancing<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
state is by enhancing them so for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.100 
state is by enhancing them so for
example<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> enhance<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.810> card

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
example I want to enhance the card

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
example I want to enhance the card
called<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> phonics<00:01:16.979> phone<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.700> guy<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
called the phonics phone this guy is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
called the phonics phone this guy is
very<00:01:18.030> rare<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.930> there's<00:01:19.140> no<00:01:19.259> identical<00:01:19.830> cards

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
very rare so there's no identical cards

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
very rare so there's no identical cards
out<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> need<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> choose<00:01:22.020> other

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
out there so I need to choose other

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
out there so I need to choose other
enhancer<00:01:23.490> cards<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.659> actually<00:01:25.100> enhance<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
enhancer cards to actually enhance the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
enhancer cards to actually enhance the
reformist<00:01:26.909> car<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:28.080> choose<00:01:28.409> maybe<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
reformist car so I can choose maybe the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.940 
reformist car so I can choose maybe the
overall<00:01:29.729> lower<00:01:29.909> statistic<00:01:30.810> class<00:01:30.960> once<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
overall lower statistic class once you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
overall lower statistic class once you
use<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.490> card<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.030> enhancer<00:01:33.750> card<00:01:34.020> those

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
use the card for enhancer card those

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.219 
use the card for enhancer card those
cuts<00:01:34.680> will<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.150> removed<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> adsorbed<00:01:37.079> into

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
cuts will be removed and adsorbed into

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
cuts will be removed and adsorbed into
the<00:01:37.470> rare<00:01:37.979> card<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.700> enhancing<00:01:39.360> right

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the rare card that I'm enhancing right

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.580 
the rare card that I'm enhancing right
now<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.320> let<00:01:40.619> me<00:01:40.650> choose<00:01:41.189> maybe<00:01:41.490> disco<00:01:42.060> bling

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
now so let me choose maybe disco bling

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
now so let me choose maybe disco bling
so<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.890> weak<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:45.030> she

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so there will be weak so I can she

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.139 
so there will be weak so I can she
absorb<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.680> night<00:01:46.920> also<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:48.030> bit

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
absorb it the night also is a little bit

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.429 
absorb it the night also is a little bit
weak<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:49.110> well<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:50.009> let<00:01:50.579> me<00:01:50.610> press<00:01:50.970> enhance

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
weak as well so now let me press enhance

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
weak as well so now let me press enhance
the<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> phone<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.979> cut<00:01:53.220> using<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.880> Goblin

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the the phone is cut using the Goblin

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
the the phone is cut using the Goblin
and<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.570> night<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.399> presto<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.700> actually

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and the night and presto is actually

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.109 
and the night and presto is actually
enhance<00:01:58.049> right<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.310> those<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
enhance right now and those the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.510 
enhance right now and those the
statistics<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.930> levels<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.040> rare

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
statistics and the levels of the rare

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.020 
statistics and the levels of the rare
card<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.030> improve<00:02:03.630> by<00:02:04.110> doing<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.030> once

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
card actually improve by doing so once
