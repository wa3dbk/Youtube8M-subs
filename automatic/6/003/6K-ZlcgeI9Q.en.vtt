00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.679
 at the beginning 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.820
 the launch of the season 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.349
 mexico 2010 of the tarumba the show started 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.269
 right in our house 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.399
 Because we 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.140
 We are installed many years ago 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.630
 that old house 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.990
 the team I went from the Tyrion Republic blown up there is our 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.800
 school 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.980
 and I think we had never released 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.070
 a season 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.340
 the writing 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.320
 then taking advantage 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.880
 these festive times and taking advantage of say 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.650
 that will of the municipality if support good team culture 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.060
 let's try there to get permission, it was not necessary 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.720
 I was possible but at least we need this space there they have it 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.650
 in this way they can have security there they have it but pure ballack that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 here we are but good landau is a show 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.290
 Peruvian mostly on the coast 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 it is a show that is very much nourished 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.470
 I think that crossed out loses all the legacy 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 with pancho fierro 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.040
 it's a show that has 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.680
 the feeling that remembering is a feeling is really a habit of the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.640
 ambient 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.350
 of sensuality 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.460
 And joy 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.550
 so I think that somehow that rhythm can portray a little big 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.750
 to fall a bit what we Peruvians are 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.030
 it also excels to separate regret but there are also opportunities for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.060
 serve to celebrate that to get ahead then 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.740
 the spokesman for the unrwa our season just on october 3 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.790
 2010 Tehran prohibited by law but we are going for you
