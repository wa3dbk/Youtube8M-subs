00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
want to admit to myself that there might

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.420 
want to admit to myself that there might
be<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.470> else<00:01:34.500> wrong<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.010> know<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.160> kept

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.790 
be something else wrong you know I kept
thinking<00:01:35.760> that<00:01:35.790> maybe<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.800> accidentally

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
thinking that maybe I accidentally

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.590 
thinking that maybe I accidentally
slipped<00:01:38.010> in<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.280> milk<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:38.970> something<00:01:39.390> into

slipped in some milk or something into
my<00:01:39.720> food<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:41.190> was<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.460> getting<00:01:41.790> sick

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
from that but eventually we went into

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.300 
from that but eventually we went into
the<00:01:44.700> doctor<00:01:44.850> again<00:01:45.300> because<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.660> was<00:01:46.250> way<00:01:47.250> too

I<00:02:06.810> thought<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.080> kind<00:02:07.230> of<00:02:07.320> weird<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.890> they

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
I thought was kind of weird but they

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.300 
I thought was kind of weird but they
didn't<00:02:08.580> understand<00:02:08.940> why<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.070> I

of<00:03:26.800> a<00:03:26.860> weird<00:03:26.980> name<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:29.200> started

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
of a weird name but we started

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
researching it and he ended up finding

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.590 
researching it and he ended up finding
Karen<00:03:33.310> burr<00:03:33.459> Myers<00:03:33.700> we<00:03:34.030> could<00:03:34.180> got<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.360> cure

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
Karen burr Myers we could got a cure

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.290 
Karen burr Myers we could got a cure
diet<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:36.280> was<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.550> most<00:03:36.730> promising<00:03:37.090> thing

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
diet and it was the most promising thing

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.130 
diet and it was the most promising thing
that<00:03:37.450> we<00:03:37.540> saw<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.020> I<00:03:38.170> wasn't<00:03:38.500> sure<00:03:39.489> if<00:03:40.140> it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
that we saw and I wasn't sure if it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.920 
that we saw and I wasn't sure if it
would<00:03:41.230> work<00:03:41.410> or<00:03:41.620> not<00:03:41.770> but<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.940> mean<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.180> had<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.360> 60

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
would work or not but I mean I had a 60

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.690 
would work or not but I mean I had a 60
day<00:03:44.050> money-back<00:03:44.350> guarantee<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.160> we<00:03:45.280> figured

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
day money-back guarantee so we figured

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.470 
day money-back guarantee so we figured
we<00:03:45.880> should<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.750> could<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.050> do<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:48.390> invest<00:03:49.390> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
we should we could just do it invest a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.090 
we should we could just do it invest a
little<00:03:49.600> money<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:49.989> hopefully<00:03:50.650> what<00:03:50.830> would<00:03:50.950> be

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
little money and hopefully what would be

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.610 
little money and hopefully what would be
a<00:03:51.430> wonderful<00:03:52.030> future<00:03:52.600> for<00:03:52.810> me<00:03:52.930> because<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.470> was

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
a wonderful future for me because I was

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.020 
a wonderful future for me because I was

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.259 
wasn't feeling sick anymore and I know
what<00:04:16.150> was<00:04:16.269> amazing<00:04:16.359> about<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:18.060> program<00:04:19.060> was

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
what was amazing about this program was

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.290 
what was amazing about this program was
that<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.630> wasn't<00:04:20.820> necessarily<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.150> take

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
that it wasn't necessarily just take

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.990 
that it wasn't necessarily just take
away<00:04:22.479> all<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:22.720> symptoms<00:04:23.040> but<00:04:24.040> it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.879 

actually<00:04:28.000> help<00:04:28.210> me<00:04:30.360> become<00:04:31.360> better<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:32.530> didn't

actually help me become better I didn't
I<00:04:33.010> never<00:04:33.250> thought

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
I never thought

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.409 
I never thought
that's<00:04:35.889> when<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.250> was<00:04:36.370> first<00:04:36.699> diagnosed<00:04:37.270> with

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
that's when I was first diagnosed with

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.760 
that's when I was first diagnosed with
all<00:04:37.539> the<00:04:37.630> allergies

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.770 
all the allergies
we<00:04:39.889> come<00:04:40.400> through<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.819> I<00:04:40.880> do<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.300> forever<00:04:41.509> you

I<00:04:42.629> should<00:04:43.169> probably<00:04:43.289> that<00:04:43.770> they<00:04:44.009> would<00:04:44.159> never

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:44.249 
I should probably that they would never

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:58.040 
I should probably that they would never
go<00:04:44.490> away<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.999> they<00:04:45.330> might<00:04:45.539> get<00:04:45.719> worse
