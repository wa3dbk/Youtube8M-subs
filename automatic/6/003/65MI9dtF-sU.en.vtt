00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.169
 the third biggest step since the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.740
 departure after the trace and the film and 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.170
 The pacific 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.940
 a step that has not spared the 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.240
 lhouest peaceful was very trying 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.010
 for me very windy and it started 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.859
 by the first World rudder box 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.510
 first goal then second I 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.980
 managed to end up somehow with a 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.630
 only saffron 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.980
 I had to stop amÃ©lie chrif a little 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.000
 atoll in the middle of nowhere in 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.460
 the Pacific Ocean 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.339
 alas against all odds I faced 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.980
 a pretty strong storm 120 km hour 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.060
 in front for a lot of hours at night 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.130
 and 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.380
 and thus going to pine mahfal and my 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.720
 sailing actually I got boat to 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 view and the capsized and capsized 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.360
 net off 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.040
 I was propelled on the tendon am 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.240
 blocked the back is really creepy and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.330
 so after the maple leaf 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.830
 on boat for also tied the sail 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.660
 all with the wind that is done in the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.220
 good waters everywhere did that I managed his 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.340
 rising Albanian rations found 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.870
 elongated block a canvas bag and then 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.020
 after that continued the pilot 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.449
 automatic is in full harbor the 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.180
 second and did it jean bart the whole 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.680
 night and then I can even do more 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.210
 a lot a sextant I knew even more 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 where was the coral reef so I 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.950
 darker right be coral reef 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.990
 so there it was pretty tense enough and mr 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.960
 really have crossed difficult he had 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 a small step quickly without 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.460
 go down on an idea on the island to on 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.780
 the coral reef 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.080
 because I had the mainsail 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.450
 was outright out of the mas is stuck 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.850
 I could neither mountain in December is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.850
 so we had to fix that I had more 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.900
 of electronics on board batteries in 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.110
 it's a short circuit 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.369
 here in the hull first and I had to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.570
 luck because it really failed 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.590
 take fire happily I got the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.590
 lazy to cut the circuit breaker 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.820
 I realized that 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.500
 dacquoise we had burned and so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.040
 here I am really between 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 disasters explained win already the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.860
 rest because I have a pain 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.630
 thankfully coming back from a long arm 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.160
 that I had spoiled that reappears so I 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.570
 do not take enough care of my body and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 I have a lot of wounds everywhere 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.500
 which absolutely had to heal mine 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.010
 nothing has not hurt me chained since the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
 Polynesia 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.090
 and then there especially dismasting and repairing 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.600
 this maquis that has the throat at the back which 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.820
 is open 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.000
 I have to stay ratified the mast is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.490
 on a good part over a meter and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.040
 and then fix the driver problems 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.050
 so here we should find what he 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.590
 need on the spot but a short week 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.660
 working 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.420
 and then after fresh start for the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.130
 prob ali and I hope on a dia 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.130
 will spare me a little bit more because 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.550
 I'm enough I let it die but in 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.820
 same time I have memories 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.520
 fantastic 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.570
 critics is really good 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.570
 a good moment of this journey
