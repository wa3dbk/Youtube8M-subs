00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
this is a video of the same process but

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:24.950 
this is a video of the same process but
slow<00:01:12.080> down<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.680> one-tenth<00:01:13.250> speed

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 

you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> dry<00:01:26.220> eyes<00:01:26.400> sublimating<00:01:27.090> and

you can see the dry eyes sublimating and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
you can see the dry eyes sublimating and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.980 

I<00:01:38.909> found<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.810> was

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I found that this was

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
I found that this was
temperature-dependent<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:41.220> warmer<00:01:42.210> water<00:01:42.420> is
