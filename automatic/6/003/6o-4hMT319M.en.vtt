00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
we now come to the next step

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.660 
we now come to the next step
that<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.689> planter<00:00:28.200> a<00:00:28.410> step<00:00:29.099> using<00:00:29.550> the

ball<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> foot<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> notation<00:00:31.619> it

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
ball of the foot in the notation it

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.840 
ball of the foot in the notation it
looks<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> ball<00:00:35.190> touches<00:00:35.519> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
looks like this the ball touches the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.600 
looks like this the ball touches the
floor<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.230> F<00:00:37.410> space<00:00:37.920> space<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> stave

we<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.180> two<00:00:42.660> planters<00:00:43.199> struck<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
we see here two planters struck with the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.479 
we see here two planters struck with the
right<00:00:44.280> foot<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:45.540> with<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> left<00:00:46.489> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
Tina will now dance this bar a very

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.400 
Tina will now dance this bar a very
frequent<00:01:02.700> rhythmic<00:01:03.210> group<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> flamenco

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
frequent rhythmic group in the flamenco

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.100 
frequent rhythmic group in the flamenco
is<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:04.979> quadruplet<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:06.030> notation<00:01:06.630> looks

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
is the quadruplet the notation looks

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
is the quadruplet the notation looks
like<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.910> we<00:01:08.910> can<00:01:09.060> recognize<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
like this we can recognize the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
like this we can recognize the
quadruplet<00:01:10.320> by<00:01:10.710> its<00:01:10.890> double<00:01:11.310> beam<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
quadruplet by its double beam the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.719 
quadruplet by its double beam the
quadruplet<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.619> semi<00:01:14.009> quavers<00:01:14.550> which

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
quadruplet is for semi quavers which

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
quadruplet is for semi quavers which
have<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.149> rhythmic<00:01:15.570> value<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.410> crotchet

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
have the rhythmic value of a crotchet
these<00:01:17.340> four<00:01:17.700> semiquavers<00:01:18.539> are<00:01:18.780> connected

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
these four semiquavers are connected

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.650 
these four semiquavers are connected
with<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.680> double<00:01:20.100> beam<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:21.270> notation

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
with a double beam in our notation

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.040

that if the note stem is pointing

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.549 
that if the note stem is pointing
downwards<00:05:06.429> then<00:05:07.089> the<00:05:07.300> punter<00:05:07.719> is<00:05:07.899> performed

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:08.559 
downwards then the punter is performed

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.100 
downwards then the punter is performed

with the left foot otherwise it is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.829 
with the left foot otherwise it is

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:13.839 
always the right foot Betina will now

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:39.540 
always the right foot Betina will now
dance<00:05:14.199> this<00:05:14.739> savety<00:05:15.459> ah<00:05:15.489> doh

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.480 

we<00:05:40.090> can<00:05:40.270> also<00:05:40.479> translate<00:05:41.259> the<00:05:41.530> punter<00:05:41.949> into<00:05:42.460> a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
we can also translate the punter into a

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.300 
we can also translate the punter into a
completely<00:05:42.940> different<00:05:43.120> rhythm<00:05:44.050> let<00:05:44.949> us<00:05:45.069> look

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
completely different rhythm let us look

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.790 
completely different rhythm let us look
at<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.550> notation

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
at the notation

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.400 
at the notation
we<00:05:48.580> can<00:05:48.789> see<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.180> we<00:05:49.360> are<00:05:49.389> again<00:05:49.840> dealing

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
we can see that we are again dealing

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.610 
we can see that we are again dealing
with<00:05:50.590> triplets<00:05:50.830> here<00:05:51.340> however<00:05:52.180> this<00:05:52.870> time<00:05:53.229> the
