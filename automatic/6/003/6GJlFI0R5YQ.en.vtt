00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the school is at our school a 2 2 am 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.120
 end here in frankfurt do you think it is 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.880
 a fair result in the end, too 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.139
 actually should have today today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
 also like to have taken three points 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.039
 actually the hardest was very 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
 very well have combined 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.439
 possibilities again of course yes 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.710
 even simple mistakes go to the goal 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.550
 take the second on my cap 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.890
 classic from left still right but 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.650
 does not come with so much pressure 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.290
 just go out we were 0 2 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.790
 22 have come back anyway 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.129
 you have to do this power this act of strength 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 highlight again or yes of course 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.480
 what in force because just when you mr 0 2 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.670
 behind lies in our situation 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.899
 it is extremely difficult because again 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.430
 come back and keep footballing 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.410
 played and also have ours 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.160
 possibilities and a bit 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 luck as well as a little more 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 been in it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.870
 how much has it tor of didi 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 was pleased what was also beautiful 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.550
 course for which pleased 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.960
 scary had a long injury behind 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.059
 He has always worked hard on himself 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 and for that should have been rewarded 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.720
 pain always yes our keeper and robert 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 Zieler is rolling with us at the end 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 a 2 2 how do you rate this result 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 also in the view that we 0 2 back 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.210
 So yes have a view that we only 2 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 have set back in that was a point 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.270
 For the moral one has to be so clearly 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.259
 I also clearly say that in ours 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 present situation us three points 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 would have done better 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 but on the side you have to see that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.270
 the team has after 0 2 away 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.979
 has come back to Frankfurt and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 point be very important when we next 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 week against berlin nachlegen 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 it is already on friday against berlin 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.610
 previously on the hit 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 how much i had this gate and it was 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.200
 also very nice gate for the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.360
 happy for having me, of course 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 happy because first it was a whole 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.149
 very important goal and also the kind and 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.009
 as was how he did it 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.420
 fantastic but i do not want to 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.740
 actually talk about individual players 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 because I think all the whole 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.070
 team 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 has proven and has good morale today 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.880
 So you have to be able to blow yourself in there 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 you can say that somehow 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.170
 subsided as has a look ahead we 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 already on Friday evening floodlights 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.090
 play against hertha bsc 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.369
 Three points would be important if I am very 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.519
 very important, even very important 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.599
 important that is fact I'm glad 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.120
 about people getting a point 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.599
 but we can do that, of course 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.920
 then finally gild this first one 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.239
 Just remember that this year 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.459
 very important for us now 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.930
 we have to stop and now we have to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.819
 we need our current phase 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.830
 No matter on the final day we have to 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.640
 fight them as a game day for 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.640
 to get points 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 and next week against friday against 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.769
 Berlin is always feasible 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.110
 warmly in front of your own audience 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.400
 yes our matchwinner is there the the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.590
 Jacket and a congratulation 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.459
 to his first goal again for 96 like 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.819
 Do you feel here was an important one 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.060
 game 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:01.270
 to know a point 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.250
 So you can foil your gate once 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.599
 describe how did you feel like 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.590
 Did you see it you will do it 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:12.720
 especially the problems in the training so 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.830
 today in the square 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.550
 normal so yes yes yes I am very 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 happy 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.950
 do you think it's the draw that 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.349
 draw it deserves in total 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:34.299
 yes, of course 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:37.390
 now it was 20 and we're coming so much 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:42.910
 very important such a point so wanted 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:47.140
 it is very good and we are in front of me 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.019
 build nests play three points 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.160
 We thank you, the tears is at 2 2 on 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.840
 end here in frankfurt at 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.030
 away game how do you rate this 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.799
 result at the end 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.090
 now shortly after the game you are happy 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.640
 Of course, that after a 0 2 still 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.260
 but the 2 2 do with every minute 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.340
 Of course it gets annoying because of me 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.700
 think that we are ultimately more 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.640
 deserve today and also the 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.470
 gegentore sees that we just stop there 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.700
 but have acted unhappy 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.850
 Team I've shown that 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.640
 she is intact in front of the tactics and that 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.720
 Not only does she keep fighting , too 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.850
 but also really playful 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.140
 however, maintains, and ultimately I think 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.360
 It was a highly deserved point I was 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.360
 I think one can emphasize quite positively 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.160
 that you really continue after the 0 2 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 played and played forward 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.370
 and she continued to create opportunities 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.060
 half time always has great possibilities 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.560
 philippe le the end of the 2 2 then 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.930
 but a felt victory after the 0 2 it 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.889
 There are no stories she would win 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.780
 you lose when you play 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.800
 undecided as we are today 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.570
 still down there 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.830
 It was a small step but we 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.760
 now have to step into something bigger 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.760
 in the next home game
