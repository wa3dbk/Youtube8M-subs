Life itself should be present in quality wine.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.200
There were some winemakers among my ancestors, including  my great-grandfather who grew grapes and made wine in quite a large area.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:42.200
The quintessence of natural wine is most likely that an indigenous variety should exist in its indigenous natural surroundings, with the least amount of human intervention possible.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.400
One should only intervene when things would otherwise turn out for the worse,  in order to avoid occurrences like the vines perishing or the fruit rotting.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.800
But overall, one should believe that the wildlife that lives in the vineyard,  including the bugs and the weeds, is complete just the way it is,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.400
and we shouldn’t try to get rid of it.  We don’t aim to make the vineyards completely weed-free.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.700
They all bring such micro and macro elements to the soil,  which the grapevine needs and can’t be replaced by fertilizers.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:23.600
The organisms living in the soil, the worms and the bacteria make the soil airy for the roots  by breaking down the organic elements and thus the soil gets more water.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
These are all important considerations for the vines, for the vitality of the vines.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.100
I don’t believe in soil in which everything has been destroyed  and only the grapes have been kept alive artificially.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.900
I don’t believe that in dead soil one can grow quality grapes, out of which quality wine can be made.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:56.000
Life should be present in quality wine. I find that those wines in which they use  lots of chemicals, and the winemaking is built on technology and additives,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.000
with naturalness pushed back to the background completely  or with no traces left of it at all, have a dead smell.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.700
I cannot identify myself with those wines. I can’t even drink them and I can’t recommend them to anyone.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.300
I list them among the fake products of the fake world of the 21st century.  And I feel a bit ashamed of those producers who call it wine.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:32.600
If we deal with the grapes with love, care and knowledge during their cultivation,  then the wines will bring you happiness and will put you in good heart,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.800
which as opposed to instinctive joy, is an incredible high.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.000
That’s what we’re trying to achieve with the wines.
