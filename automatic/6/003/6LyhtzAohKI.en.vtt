many variations of them like the

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.040 
many variations of them like the
vibration<00:00:15.740> only<00:00:16.010> once<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:16.730> ones<00:00:16.910> with<00:00:17.029> a<00:00:17.090> 550

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
vibration only once the ones with a 550

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.580 
vibration only once the ones with a 550
meters<00:00:18.349> range<00:00:18.619> and<00:00:18.950> so<00:00:19.220> on<00:00:19.660> also<00:00:20.660> some<00:00:21.380> are

show<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.409> receiver<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.859> matched<00:01:58.249> and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
show that the receiver is matched and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.830 
show that the receiver is matched and
working<00:02:03.579> using<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.670> switching<00:02:05.060> button<00:02:05.359> the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
working using the switching button the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.419 
working using the switching button the
blue<00:02:06.020> light<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.319> moved<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:06.950> second<00:02:07.280> dog

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
blue light is moved to the second dog

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.700 
blue light is moved to the second dog
and<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:08.690> now<00:02:08.840> match<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.380> second

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
and you can now match the second

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.230 
and you can now match the second
receiver<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.310> same<00:02:10.580> way<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.060> match

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
receiver in the same way that you match

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:23.450 
receiver in the same way that you match
the<00:02:11.420> first<00:02:11.660> one

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.650 

with<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.610> rolling<00:02:25.030> matching<00:02:25.420> codes

technology<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.620> system<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.910> control

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
technology in the system we can control

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.370 
technology in the system we can control
the<00:02:28.450> two<00:02:28.630> dogs<00:02:28.870> separately<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.900> test<00:02:32.170> light

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
the two dogs separately the test light

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.620 
the two dogs separately the test light
can<00:02:32.590> be<00:02:32.620> used<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.190> detect<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.700> shock<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.270> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
can be used to detect the shock if you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.480 
can be used to detect the shock if you
don't<00:02:34.810> want<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.990> try<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.320> yourself<00:02:35.710> you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
don't want to try it on yourself you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.700 
don't want to try it on yourself you
just<00:02:36.700> put<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.270> prongs<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.900> then<00:02:38.440> check

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
just put it on the prongs and then check

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:46.170 
just put it on the prongs and then check
to<00:02:38.740> see<00:02:39.070> if<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.250> light<00:02:39.400> appears<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.550> if<00:02:45.910> we<00:02:46.030> want

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
to see if a light appears so if we want

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.150 
to see if a light appears so if we want
the<00:02:46.360> receiver<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.930> shock<00:02:47.170> at<00:02:47.350> level<00:02:47.590> 7<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
the receiver to shock at level 7 for the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.220 
the receiver to shock at level 7 for the
first<00:02:48.430> dog<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.510> rotate<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.990> thumbwheel

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
first dog we can rotate the thumbwheel

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.500 
first dog we can rotate the thumbwheel
until<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.740> reaches<00:02:51.070> 7<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.210> press<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
until it reaches 7 and then press the

until it reaches 7 and then press the
shock<00:02:52.840> button<00:02:53.050> as<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.750> see<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.230> shock<00:02:56.470> is

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
shock button as you can see the shock is

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.250 
shock button as you can see the shock is
pretty<00:02:56.890> strong<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.360> press<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.750> vibration

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
pretty strong we can press the vibration

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.990 
pretty strong we can press the vibration
button<00:02:59.560> right<00:02:59.710> now<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.520> will<00:03:00.550> supposedly

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
button right now and it will supposedly

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.590 
button right now and it will supposedly
vibrate<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> first<00:03:01.960> dog<00:03:02.200> at<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.470> level<00:03:02.800> 7

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
vibrate the first dog at a level 7

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.340 
vibrate the first dog at a level 7
unfortunately<00:03:04.600> there's<00:03:04.960> not<00:03:05.140> much

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
unfortunately there's not much

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.740 
unfortunately there's not much
difference<00:03:05.380> between<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> levels<00:03:06.570> same<00:03:07.570> with

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
difference between the levels same with

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.900

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
levels with this first receiver you can

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.210 
levels with this first receiver you can
really<00:03:16.960> tell<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> difference<00:03:17.410> between<00:03:17.890> a
