00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.430 
and then of course our audio video out
so<00:04:36.210> that's<00:04:36.449> so<00:04:36.629> you<00:04:36.720> could<00:04:36.840> hook<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.110> up<00:04:37.259> to<00:04:37.319> a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
so that's so you could hook this up to a

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.260 
so that's so you could hook this up to a
television<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:38.009> course<00:04:38.039> I'm<00:04:38.909> gonna<00:04:39.000> see

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
television of course I'm gonna see

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.689 
television of course I'm gonna see
actually<00:04:39.690> I'd<00:04:39.960> like<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.379> get<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.949> probably<00:04:41.639> one

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
actually I'd like to get a probably one

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.659 
actually I'd like to get a probably one
of<00:04:41.789> those<00:04:41.909> rode<00:04:42.180> microphones<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:43.919> think<00:04:44.580> have

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
of those rode microphones I think have

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.550 
of those rode microphones I think have
difficulty<00:04:45.030> putting<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.300> back<00:04:45.449> on<00:04:45.599> and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
difficulty putting that back on and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.100 
difficulty putting that back on and
actually<00:04:47.039> do<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.669> test<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.300> what<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.690> audio<00:04:48.960> is

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
actually do a test is what the audio is

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.559 
actually do a test is what the audio is
like<00:04:49.460> what<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.580> internal<00:04:50.940> mic<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.419> on

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
like what the internal mic is like on

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.809 
like what the internal mic is like on
this<00:04:51.750> because<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.830> heard<00:04:53.039> this<00:04:53.280> isn't<00:04:53.460> too<00:04:53.789> bad

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
this because I heard this isn't too bad

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.999 
this because I heard this isn't too bad

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009
