00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
bag cap your chin or take the chanter

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.450 
bag cap your chin or take the chanter
out<00:02:20.510> cap<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.560> reed

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
out cap the the reed

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.670 
out cap the the reed
and<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:23.810> want<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.650> just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and then what we want to do is we just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
and then what we want to do is we just
want<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.100> break<00:02:25.340> down<00:02:25.640> our<00:02:25.850> instrument<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.540> lot

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
want to break down our instrument a lot

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.750 
want to break down our instrument a lot
of<00:02:26.930> times<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.350> easiest<00:02:27.620> way<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.770> do<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.070> is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
of times the easiest way to do that is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
of times the easiest way to do that is
to<00:02:29.150> take<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.260> pipe<00:02:30.530> case<00:02:30.800> or<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.130> a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
to take it in the pipe case or on a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160 
to take it in the pipe case or on a
kitchen<00:02:31.550> table<00:02:31.700> someplace<00:02:32.300> that's<00:02:32.510> safe<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
kitchen table someplace that's safe and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.710 
kitchen table someplace that's safe and
just<00:02:34.100> take<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.550> instrument<00:02:35.060> apart<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.690> that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
just take the instrument apart so that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.080 
just take the instrument apart so that
the<00:02:42.230> instrument<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:42.800> dry<00:02:43.070> out<00:02:43.280> thoroughly

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.850 

from<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:47.270> point<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:47.900> also<00:02:48.110> want<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.560> take

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
from this point we also want to take

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.940 
from this point we also want to take
apart<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.610> drones<00:02:50.000> from<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.410> tops<00:02:51.650> from

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
apart the drones from the the tops from

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.100 
apart the drones from the the tops from
the<00:02:52.100> bottoms<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.420> base<00:02:53.630> completely

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the bottoms and the base completely

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.980 
the bottoms and the base completely
apart<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.430> lot<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.700> situations<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.930> is

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
apart in a lot of situations this is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.560 
apart in a lot of situations this is
going<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.500> enough<00:03:01.340> drying<00:03:01.760> air<00:03:02.090> drying

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
going to be enough drying air drying

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.960 
going to be enough drying air drying
that<00:03:03.380> will<00:03:03.560> allow<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.070> instrument<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.850> be

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
that will allow the instrument to be

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.660 
that will allow the instrument to be
played<00:03:05.270> within<00:03:05.540> an<00:03:05.840> hour<00:03:05.990> two<00:03:06.350> hours<00:03:06.770> we<00:03:07.460> don't

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
played within an hour two hours we don't

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.860 
played within an hour two hours we don't
want<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.940> leave<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> instrument<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:08.630> this

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
want to leave the instrument like this

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.270 
want to leave the instrument like this
for<00:03:09.110> an<00:03:09.170> extended<00:03:09.590> period<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.890> time<00:03:10.100> because

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
for an extended period of time because

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.120 
for an extended period of time because
the<00:03:10.520> whole<00:03:10.550> instrument<00:03:11.120> will<00:03:11.210> dry<00:03:11.480> out<00:03:12.130> too

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
the whole instrument will dry out too

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.590 
the whole instrument will dry out too
much<00:03:13.340> between<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.050> plane<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.850> what<00:03:17.450> we've

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
much between the the plane so what we've

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.270 
much between the the plane so what we've
done<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.870> we've<00:03:18.200> broken<00:03:18.440> down<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:18.920> instrument

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
done is we've broken down the instrument

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.600 
done is we've broken down the instrument
just<00:03:19.490> so<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:19.970> can<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.180> air<00:03:20.300> dried<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
just so that it can be air dried the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.600 
just so that it can be air dried the
next<00:03:22.940> stage<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.600> would<00:03:24.020> be<00:03:24.230> also<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.740> swab

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
next stage to this would be also to swab

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.690 
next stage to this would be also to swab
out<00:03:25.880> or<00:03:26.150> brush<00:03:26.600> out<00:03:26.870> your<00:03:27.140> drones<00:03:28.010> removing

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
out or brush out your drones removing

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.050 
out or brush out your drones removing
any<00:03:28.880> excess<00:03:29.510> moisture<00:03:30.280> what<00:03:31.280> we<00:03:31.430> want<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.880> do

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
any excess moisture what we want to do

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.020 
any excess moisture what we want to do
is<00:03:32.330> we<00:03:32.630> want<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.020> take<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.620> drone<00:03:33.830> reads<00:03:34.130> out

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.030 

marking<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.120> drone<00:03:41.330> reads<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.900> know<00:03:42.110> which

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
marking the drone reads so we know which

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.900 
marking the drone reads so we know which
tenor<00:03:43.370> goes<00:03:43.640> into<00:03:43.940> which<00:03:44.090> tenor<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.760> at<00:03:46.760> this

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
tenor goes into which tenor and at this

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.240 
tenor goes into which tenor and at this
point<00:03:47.240> we<00:03:47.360> want<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.660> take<00:03:47.930> our<00:03:48.140> swabs<00:03:48.500> or<00:03:48.890> our

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
point we want to take our swabs or our

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.220 
point we want to take our swabs or our
brushes<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.120> we<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.170> want<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:52.810> swap<00:03:53.810> out<00:03:54.050> the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
brushes and we just want to swap out the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.070 
brushes and we just want to swap out the
drones<00:03:54.500> quickly<00:03:55.540> removing<00:03:56.540> any<00:03:56.780> excess
