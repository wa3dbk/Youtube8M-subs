so<00:00:03.330> my<00:00:03.810> first<00:00:04.080> patch<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.680> called<00:00:05.009> Ock<00:00:05.220> ditch

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.300 

cool<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.660> patch<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.410> really<00:00:20.070> wanted

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
cool so for this patch I really wanted

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.779 
cool so for this patch I really wanted
to<00:00:20.689> explore<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> capabilities<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.800> being

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to explore the capabilities of being

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
to explore the capabilities of being
able<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.090> essentially<00:00:24.960> pitch<00:00:25.289> shift<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
able to essentially pitch shift the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
able to essentially pitch shift the
strings<00:00:26.670> using<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> GK<00:00:27.599> pick<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.109> lot<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
strings using the GK pick up a lot of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
strings using the GK pick up a lot of
our<00:00:28.680> sound<00:00:28.949> revolves<00:00:29.730> around<00:00:29.939> trying<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
our sound revolves around trying to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840 
our sound revolves around trying to
emulate<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.949> seven<00:00:32.489> string<00:00:32.730> an

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
emulate that very seven string an

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
emulate that very seven string an
eight-string<00:00:33.300> sound

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.810 

you

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.189 

playing<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.999> three-piece<00:00:51.420> I've<00:00:51.719> really<00:00:52.079> got

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
playing in a three-piece I've really got

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.479 
playing in a three-piece I've really got
to<00:00:52.230> fill<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.159> really<00:00:53.280> need<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to fill it out you really really need a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:10.090 
to fill it out you really really need a
thick<00:00:53.820> thick<00:00:54.059> thick<00:00:54.210> tone

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.460 

this<00:01:11.100> next<00:01:11.370> patch<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.910> called<00:01:12.300> slow<00:01:12.840> synth<00:01:13.229> on

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
this next patch is called slow synth on

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.090 
this next patch is called slow synth on
this<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.250> I've<00:01:14.400> essentially<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
this one here I've essentially got a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
this one here I've essentially got a
really<00:01:17.100> big<00:01:17.369> sore<00:01:17.700> wave<00:01:17.909> synth<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.570> only

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
really big sore wave synth which only

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.859 
really big sore wave synth which only
triggers<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> sixth<00:01:20.670> string<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.570> hear

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
triggers on the sixth string if you hear

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
triggers on the sixth string if you hear
I'll<00:01:22.080> strum<00:01:22.740> essentially<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.580> bass<00:01:23.850> note

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I'll strum essentially like a bass note

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.800 
I'll strum essentially like a bass note
but<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.660> can<00:01:24.780> hear<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> only<00:01:25.320> triggers

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
but you can hear that it only triggers

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.910 
but you can hear that it only triggers
essentially<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.990> once<00:01:28.290> per<00:01:28.710> chord<00:01:29.040> so

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.490 

I<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:37.119> blend<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.420> with<00:01:37.479> my<00:01:37.630> normal<00:01:37.960> signal<00:01:38.259> so

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
I can blend it with my normal signal so

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.710 
I can blend it with my normal signal so
when<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.070> blend<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.430> with<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.820> massive<00:01:40.390> fat

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
when I blend it with a massive fat

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.600 
when I blend it with a massive fat
chorus<00:01:41.049> guitar<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.490> these

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
chorus guitar and you get these

00:01:42.610 --> 00:02:01.180 
chorus guitar and you get these
absolutely<00:01:43.390> enormous<00:01:43.840> sounds

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.100 

for<00:02:02.190> my<00:02:02.310> next<00:02:02.370> patch<00:02:02.820> which<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.450> called<00:02:03.630> drop

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
for my next patch which is called drop

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
here so as you're playing it goes down

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:22.860 
here so as you're playing it goes down
in<00:02:11.850> tunings

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.800 

my<00:02:23.620> next<00:02:23.920> patch<00:02:24.129> is<00:02:24.489> called<00:02:24.879> over<00:02:25.330> an<00:02:25.450> organ

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
something I way to make here is with a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.530 
something I way to make here is with a
clean<00:02:28.840> sound<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:30.220> bringing<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.879> some<00:02:31.390> of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
clean sound and then bringing in some of

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.199 
clean sound and then bringing in some of
the<00:02:31.659> since<00:02:31.900> underneath<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:33.099> really<00:02:33.310> back<00:02:34.000> it
