00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.800
 arteries has planted more than 1 million 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.400
 700 thousand seedlings of native species 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.440
 throughout five Brazilian states 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.500
 our concessionaires carry out plantations 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.050
 in conservation areas 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 including riparian forests 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 present on the banks of streams lakes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.849
 rivers and dams 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 restoration of riparian forests is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.309
 essential for all living beings because 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.270
 directly affects the availability of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.270
 water for survival 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.329
 we of the artery have a commitment 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.129
 serious about the environment 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 We surround ourselves with all care also 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.840
 in waste management to avoid 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 water contamination 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.230
 in addition we realized the planting of grass 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.950
 in all our 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.770
 are more than 3,200 km 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.300
 this action prevents erosion allows the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.150
 infiltration of water into the sheets 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.090
 water and retains soil nutrients 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.420
 besides making your trip much more 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.670
 required affect directly 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.050
 the availability of water to the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.330
 survival 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.910
 if you do your part and stay still 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.270
 easier to help the planet 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.790
 Say I saw the clothes rationally 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 an open faucet in the tank spends in 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.550
 average 18 liters of water per minute 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 just open the tap when the clothes 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.560
 is soaked in a bucket 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.229
 use the same water to scrub and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.830
 soak the faucet open only 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.210
 in xavi keep all the water in the bucket is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.380
 great for washing your yard and sidewalk 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.080
 tip 2 wash the car the ideal is cleaning 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.720
 that have as good a 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.300
 the traditional ones with the use of water 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.390
 but if you still resist this new 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.190
 technique and want to use water the biggest tip 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.070
 is to plan cleaning 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.850
 always wash the car 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.370
 obeying soaping and rinsing 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.680
 one area at a time starts 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.200
 cleaning by the higher parts 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.050
 so the lowest have benefited from 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.570
 water used in the first one hose 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.260
 open spends every three minutes the 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.240
 enough water for things 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.760
 use at the end of the hose but leave the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.300
 revolver type it helps you save money 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.860
 up to 50% water 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.860
 we also count on your participation 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.260
