00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.880
 There are hardly any games where the specialists are always quite united without one 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.429
 bribery 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.119
 Resident Evil 4 has again managed to win this miracle 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.659
 The zombie shooter and zombies are among the festivals ever played 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.960
 Reason enough to take a closer look 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.720
 thanks here and now our future on the other 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 Brazil down 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 The government is one of the coolest people of all time 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.800
 the blond handsome can not only look good could not say like pots 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.380
 to burst Northeim 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 the tears rolling slogans in stock 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.380
 the latter unclear 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.760
 if degree 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.640
 this game is looking for you 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.950
 It would be easy in the vanishing point 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.040
 The boss battles are so important 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.110
 after reporting a video game 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.840
 they have to be spectacular and demanding 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.760
 on the meadow Willich Broder 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.040
 nervous 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.750
 there are four spots forces counted to shorten our portals 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 simply be denied 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.250
 In addition, there is a toy world that has changed little over the years 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.600
 this tradition was broken with Part 4 and is groundbreaking for all 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.230
 future show 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.370
 no more static cameras and no viruses to kill living beings 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.260
 makes 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.100
 the big factor is his life of the game street but massively increased 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 what more do you want 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.880
 yes, there are also negative aspects to the game 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.150
 One thing please immediately catches the eye St incredibly cold 6000 blind 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.460
 While there are some opponents waiting 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.680
 however, their appearance is constantly repeated 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.430
 However, it only slightly disturbing 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.240
 back conspicuous year stormed in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 actually no flop value 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.280
 the GameCube was a wonderful console 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.999
 I was always and immediately in terms of graphics 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.189
 whoever is here is one of the very few games 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.349
 Regis managed by hiring and optimizing a horde of providers 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.759
 to conjure the screen 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.409
 without a single restaurant 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.879
 the cutscenes were in real time, at least in the public version 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.029
 in times here and there again what may I do anything is possible and electricity 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.029
 successful 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.649
 the guys like the opponent 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.319
 not bad at all 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.329
 But also not 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.469
 as well as Dieckmann developers described 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.539
 Year League track and seek their way 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.609
 but why should they use such a ladder a thousand times when the am 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.179
 Soil is standing and constantly reversed 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:51.159
 then again 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.039
 it's also video games now 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.289
 the train became unnecessarily heavy after 1 0 due to the uncertain situation 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.359
 do 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.359
 what the hell 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.879
 who would have thought a limited interference 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.279
 be positive 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.680
 he's been building since I'm running now and the ability to jump all the time 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.689
 He dissected it maybe clear distinction of a normal shooter 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:19.759
 Control 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:24.529
 In addition, there is an average of 14 7 actions which gives whether you have 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.899
 a fault which simply works 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.909
 thanks to the wii-version tray goals no longer make sense of the thing 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.719
 the controls are so perfect that Capcom stayed for him in charge of the prizes 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.039
 takes over including in the 10 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.039
 and also the crosshair 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.179
 OK 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.179
 It was always about a happy marriage 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.129
 it is a successful change and a striking feature 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.549
 best of all taxes 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.939
 Not 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 Romney in it 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:04.999
 Class details 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.659
 Refugees reported 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:09.979
 be with a blast 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.989
 Norman wanted to take a long breath to read 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.139
 that also happen to him 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.139
 it is 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.330
 Mackie knives become a proud nine 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.020
 the fear that it is a true miracle weapon 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.430
 Isserstedt not boxing and firm No Bisping them to explode carbon 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.090
 this is how the inventors are made to look as though they were hit by the train 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.909
 Europe must have directed Gallen a spendthrift like Mozart 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.650
 happy and fast from her 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.779
 grandiose 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.120
 renounce this policy with the games 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.430
 while the set up 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.370
 As Carney said Resident Evil 4 is and remains exclusive to the Cube 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.969
 should it turn out differently you should cut off your head 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.819
 how many times has that been the topics and ported 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.300
 1 2 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.990
 I like 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.830
 no wonder that after the announcement of the ps2 version on which he no 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.800
 Had influence 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.790
 St Pauli enid team left at Capcom and joined the new driver studio team 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.419
 Â»is of course closed by Capcom for days 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.240
 with the final left the company 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.740
 Resident Evil 5 is therefore developed without the inventor of the series 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.449
 supreme competition supervision in partial retirement 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.229
 we can only hope 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.130
 what Capcom will be traveling 1 1 copy of the Classic 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.479
 Here's the principle 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.559
 also from whose 5 can make a good game 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.739
 however, doubts remain with me personally
