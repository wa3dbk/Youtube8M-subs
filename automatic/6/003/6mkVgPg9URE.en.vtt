 Y 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.850
 good people good i here I hope another 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.460
 but this time I'm not going to bring you a 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.060
 minecraft tutorial or anything like that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.430
 game or anything else is like a help 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.730
 since for the same of minecraft and that 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.710
 they have asked me how to increase the ram 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.670
 for the server to go faster 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.030
 get so much good my pc is a laptop 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.110
 really is the guide but well there with 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.390
 the good trotters will teach them 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.239
 first good connect the mayan key 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.590
 pendrive usb memory as you want 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.640
 call her 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 and the properties this was taught to me by an 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.350
 cousin actually I asked him how and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.989
 he taught me this to increase the ram 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 it would be like an external branch of the pc already 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.570
 that minecraft uses a lot 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.400
 trump matthews ambuquÃ­ to all moms 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.430
 well then you work so read to 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.100
 readyboost in properties was very 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.710
 clear if I hope here will come 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.690
 marked this do not use that device 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.790
 as they want to use it they should use this 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.750
 device there's not much science in 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.990
 our rod here has recommended him 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.259
 well I do not know my mayan key followed or not 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.350
 they served themselves well it was like 16 from there 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.950
 you have 13 available and that 3 gigas 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.470
 it's pretty much sweats me how many gigas and 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.259
 want to use then there they put it if 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.240
 they want to use one they put me a thousand since they are 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.840
 megas do not gas me 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.149
 and 2003 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.950
 well this has been recommended so I 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.899
 will wear 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.789
 after dialing it use this 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.130
 device mark the reserved space 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.960
 they give him to accept 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.119
 they wait readyboost is setting the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.119
 cache memory or is it 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.880
 and they will see there 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:15.050
 from step 13 to environment 9 and you will see that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 it has come out ready post 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.200
 here a cache file that does not touch it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.230
 that's like a second ram memory that 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.260
 has in the compulsa what external 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.540
 Before removing the mesh , 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.090
 I recommend I do not know what happens if they do not 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.290
 and I want to find out what goes into the network 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.489
 bulls 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.489
 this device will not be 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.850
 it is expected is still waiting 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.050
 and good 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.370
 more as was your space has been 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.780
 recovered do not lose anything can be 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.750
 how many times do you want 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.390
 Upon entering you will see that you are already 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.530
 and well it's going very well accelerates a lot 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.490
 compu leather on the case then 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.020
 that is, there are strawberries 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.040
 then yes very good already degenerates 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.370
 be annoying 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.599
 another thing more personally I 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.750
 I recommend that you download another 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.460
 program this game booster has left me 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.790
 very good 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.760
 then he said very well surely what 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.700
 go up to the description below the video if 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.010
 is not down found 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.810
 I'm interested 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.410
 but it's very good it speeds you up a lot 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.480
 compu more with usb 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.790
 then it's very good I hope you have them 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.720
 served this I do not know how to call it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.720
 tutorial 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.799
 I wish they had served as humanist 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.689
 up to the good video explain above 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.450
 comment what if they did not understand something 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.670
 they take up something else to do other things 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.290
 ask me there are no problems I 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.689
 I will answer 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.250
 and well that's all and the chest is not 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.140
 they are crying so I would go see what it is 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.140
