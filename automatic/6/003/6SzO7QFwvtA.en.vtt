Earl marshal and this bull was the

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.470 
Earl marshal and this bull was the
backbone<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.510> many<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:42.310> good<00:03:42.790> cattle<00:03:43.299> in

backbone of many of the good cattle in
America<00:03:44.049> today<00:03:44.579> well<00:03:45.579> probably<00:03:45.880> what<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.329> even

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
America today well probably what is even

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.650 
America today well probably what is even
more<00:03:46.660> amazing<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.190> time<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.910> history<00:03:49.450> that

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
more amazing is the time of history that

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.119 
more amazing is the time of history that
he<00:03:49.870> bred<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.770> bull

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
he bred this bull

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.459 
he bred this bull
and<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.939> their<00:03:53.209> genetics<00:03:53.810> would<00:03:53.989> still<00:03:54.290> be

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:54.469 
and that their genetics would still be

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.500 
and that their genetics would still be
here<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:55.010> phenomenal<00:03:55.340> because<00:03:55.879> there<00:03:56.209> was<00:03:56.329> no

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
here is phenomenal because there was no

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.089 
here is phenomenal because there was no
AI<00:03:56.659> in<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.200> 1900s

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
AI in the 1900s

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.869 
AI in the 1900s
and<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.609> believe<00:03:58.969> that<00:03:59.389> it<00:04:00.139> was<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.409> astute

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
and I believe that it was the astute

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.629 
and I believe that it was the astute

ability of mr. McHenry to line breed

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.339 
ability of mr. McHenry to line breed
these<00:04:04.879> cattle<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.510> make<00:04:05.659> them<00:04:05.840> prepotent

Aaron Ryan of Harlan Iowa and they were

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.300 
Aaron Ryan of Harlan Iowa and they were

able to propagate the the bloodlines on

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.900 
able to propagate the the bloodlines on
from<00:04:22.520> there

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
and from there they moved on into all

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.700 
and from there they moved on into all
parts<00:04:25.460> of<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.669> United<00:04:26.030> States<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.570> Canada<00:04:26.720> so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
parts of the United States and Canada so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.070 
parts of the United States and Canada so
W<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.070> really<00:04:28.430> never<00:04:28.639> got<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:29.090> see<00:04:29.389> the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
W a really never got to see the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.890 
W a really never got to see the
greatness<00:04:30.349> of<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.800> bull<00:04:30.979> but<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:32.090> think<00:04:32.660> he

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
greatness of the bull but I think he

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.999 
greatness of the bull but I think he
knew<00:04:33.190> before<00:04:34.190> he<00:04:34.280> died<00:04:34.539> because<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.740> calves

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
knew before he died because the calves

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.260 
knew before he died because the calves
then<00:04:37.970> started<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:39.229> come<00:04:39.580> out<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.880> those<00:04:41.000> cows

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
then started to come out of those cows

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.129 
then started to come out of those cows
bred<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.690> heal<00:04:41.810> Marshall<00:04:43.360> well<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.419> think<00:04:44.509> the

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
bred to heal Marshall well I think the

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.110 
bred to heal Marshall well I think the
final<00:04:45.470> days<00:04:45.650> of<00:04:45.830> W<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.250> he<00:04:46.580> had<00:04:46.759> health<00:04:47.030> problems

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.200 
as I said but he did live a long long
life<00:04:51.229> or<00:04:51.740> what<00:04:51.860> was<00:04:51.979> considered<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.520> very<00:04:52.910> long

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210
