old railroad spike and see what happens
whenever<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.470> hammer<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.840> file<00:00:24.840> knife<00:00:25.110> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
whenever I hammer a file knife that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.710 
whenever I hammer a file knife that
didn't<00:00:25.620> turn<00:00:26.040> out<00:00:26.070> quite<00:00:26.220> right<00:00:27.560> into<00:00:28.560> it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.740 

this<00:00:32.410> knife<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.980> ended<00:00:33.370> up<00:00:33.489> getting<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.390> handle

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
this knife I ended up getting the handle

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.729 
this knife I ended up getting the handle
too<00:00:35.350> wide<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.950> too<00:00:35.980> short<00:00:36.430> for<00:00:36.520> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
too wide and too short for the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.000 
too wide and too short for the
proportionate<00:00:38.739> size<00:00:39.309> of<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.640> blade<00:00:41.010> but

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
proportionate size of the blade but

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:56.260 
proportionate size of the blade but
let's<00:00:42.850> see<00:00:42.970> what<00:00:43.059> happens

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.510 

now<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> must<00:00:57.540> admit<00:00:58.040> railroad<00:00:59.040> spikes<00:00:59.340> are

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
now I must admit railroad spikes are

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.840 
now I must admit railroad spikes are
pretty<00:00:59.700> soft<00:01:01.970> whenever<00:01:03.050> enderal<00:01:04.050> form<00:01:04.850> like

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
pretty soft whenever enderal form like

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.650 
pretty soft whenever enderal form like
this<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> tried<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.940> do<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> onto<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
this one if you tried to do this onto a

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.719 
this one if you tried to do this onto a
hardened<00:01:13.080> piece<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.410> steel<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.430> probably

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
hardened piece of steel you probably

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.600 
hardened piece of steel you probably
would<00:01:14.910> destroy<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> edge<00:01:16.310> but<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> can

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
would destroy the edge but as you can

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
would destroy the edge but as you can
see<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.420> far<00:01:18.660> there's<00:01:18.930> no<00:01:19.110> damage<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
see so far there's no damage to the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.230 
see so far there's no damage to the
blade<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.710> smudge<00:01:23.190> marks<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
blade just some smudge marks from the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:44.760 
blade just some smudge marks from the
rust<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.050> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.850> railroad<00:01:27.240> spike

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.279 

now<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.799> would<00:01:46.100> never<00:01:46.310> recommend<00:01:46.700> ever<00:01:47.289> doing

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
now I would never recommend ever doing

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.660 
now I would never recommend ever doing
this<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.799> ablate<00:01:50.350> even<00:01:51.350> though<00:01:51.560> as<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.369> can

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
this to ablate even though as you can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.609 
this to ablate even though as you can
tell<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.030> one's<00:01:53.270> quite<00:01:53.570> capable<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:56.619> taking

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
tell this one's quite capable of taking

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.679 
tell this one's quite capable of taking
the<00:01:57.890> abuse<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.340> gave<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.179> far<00:01:59.450> no<00:02:00.319> damage

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
the abuse that gave it so far no damage

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.889 
the abuse that gave it so far no damage
however<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.960> will<00:02:03.829> not<00:02:03.860> replace<00:02:04.610> any<00:02:04.880> blades<00:02:05.240> if

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
however I will not replace any blades if

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.770 
however I will not replace any blades if
you<00:02:06.049> try<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.319> do<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:07.189> one<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.429> my<00:02:07.520> knives

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.140 

pretty<00:02:11.780> good<00:02:11.959> chunk<00:02:12.200> was<00:02:12.920> taken<00:02:13.280> now<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.670> tip

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
pretty good chunk was taken now that tip

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.289 
pretty good chunk was taken now that tip
of<00:02:14.269> that<00:02:14.390> railroad<00:02:14.720> spike<00:02:15.910> now<00:02:16.910> let's<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.239> if

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
of that railroad spike now let's see if

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:44.960 
of that railroad spike now let's see if
we<00:02:17.420> can't<00:02:17.660> cheer<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.799> off

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:55.360 

I<00:02:46.070> am<00:02:47.070> wearing<00:02:47.370> eye<00:02:47.520> protection<00:02:47.850> by<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.210> way

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.770 

they're<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:58.160> blade<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.340> not<00:02:59.660> damaged<00:03:00.660> at<00:03:00.840> all

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
they're with blade is not damaged at all

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.180 
they're with blade is not damaged at all
it's<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.140> little<00:03:04.290> bit<00:03:04.470> dull<00:03:05.780> which<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
it's just a little bit dull which I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.559 
it's just a little bit dull which I
guess<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.220> could<00:03:08.489> call<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.760> damage<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:09.450> you

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
guess you could call that damage if you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.440 
guess you could call that damage if you
want<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.769> there's<00:03:10.950> no<00:03:11.450> significant

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
lip off the railroad spikes but I just

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.370 
lip off the railroad spikes but I just
couldn't<00:04:18.510> get<00:04:18.660> my<00:04:20.510> life<00:04:21.510> situated<00:04:24.350> into<00:04:25.350> a

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
position where I could do it now if I

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.810 
position where I could do it now if I
had<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.850> more<00:04:30.230> stable<00:04:31.230> platform<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:32.160> reduce<00:04:32.610> the
