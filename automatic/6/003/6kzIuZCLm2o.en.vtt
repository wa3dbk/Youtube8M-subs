00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
on a diet during Thanksgiving you know

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.180 
on a diet during Thanksgiving you know
especially<00:02:27.370> when<00:02:27.850> Logan<00:02:28.810> here<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.740> eating

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
especially when Logan here is eating

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.440 
especially when Logan here is eating
like<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.820> know<00:02:31.060> two<00:02:31.450> plates<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.020> food<00:02:33.450> smaller

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
like you know two plates of food smaller

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.260 
like you know two plates of food smaller
bites<00:02:34.900> equals<00:02:35.350> smaller<00:02:35.650> calories<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.150> think

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
bites equals smaller calories so I think

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.940 
bites equals smaller calories so I think
it<00:02:37.630> was<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.780> good<00:02:37.900> idea<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.230> all<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.560> us<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.710> have
