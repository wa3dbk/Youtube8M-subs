first drilling a pilot hole through rock
this<00:02:04.580> heart<00:02:04.880> can<00:02:05.300> easily<00:02:05.780> deflect<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> cutter

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
this heart can easily deflect the cutter

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.670 
this heart can easily deflect the cutter
and<00:02:06.890> force<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.640> drill<00:02:07.910> pipe<00:02:08.119> way<00:02:08.660> off<00:02:08.869> target

and second pulling the Reimer up through

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:25.059 
and second pulling the Reimer up through
so<00:02:15.280> much<00:02:15.489> rock<00:02:15.819> has<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.629> be<00:02:16.750> done<00:02:16.930> right

so if all goes well this hole will take

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.730 
so if all goes well this hole will take
about<00:04:24.830> six<00:04:25.160> months<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.820> finish<00:04:26.440> all<00:04:27.440> the
