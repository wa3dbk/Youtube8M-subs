00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 weeks for you about the Czech government 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.700
 second goal of mans artist the Chinese pib will pass the American in 2027 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.190
 but if you pick up the pib in purchasing power parity is already going on 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.250
 then 2015 will pass through the United States and will continue up there 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.539
 but for me and I do not care 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.000
 most important are exports 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089
 You get here in billions of dollars to 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.680
 china exported more than united states in 2010 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.160
 so for me china is already the most important country in the world mainly 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 because it is already the biggest importer in Brazil 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.230
 has pp 192 which analyzed growth of brics 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.310
 the home he had 99 made in 2003 then in 2009 cider or net tariq 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.090
 since the end of the crisis 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.250
 and they said that China was the most surprising 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.950
 why is there a delay that selling china learn people because 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.490
 there they little bit too much so they little in 53% tone of the pib 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.420
 invests almost 48 in the spare what open press borrows united states 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 the Chinese state has invested micharia 3% of GDP 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.840
 even so with much borrowed by the flood 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.109
 then you see that this decision I will never get another passage 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.990
 exports because there is no investment in China other than 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 working hard to invest in the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 you see how it works they produce half of the steel produced in the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.360
 world and for that they served the spa in dressing in mobile wine constructions 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.800
 for 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.100
 china also walks right 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.500
 another thing they claim is that china ptac its currency in the wrong morumbi 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.940
 very 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.080
 devalued 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.600
 the Chinese currency saw if it had horrified they would not have succeeded 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.060
 increase imports in 2009 and 2010 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.869
 then we are at the right point 5 of their currency can enter the exports 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.280
 and imports 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.710
 so who took the world out of the crisis of 2008 was surely the sisters 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.860
 but their currency is delicious as we analyze the currency of a country 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.720
 you get caught 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.190
 parity and power of with the pide vide by the pibia aprece trader in currency 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.019
 American 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.320
 then you wish that the Chinese currency was valued 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.440
 they devalue the coin end if the 94 here gave a goal of inhaca 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.159
 and now here in 2008 to re-appreciate the currency and acquaintances 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.999
 increased imports and took advantage of the crisis 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:34.069
 then it is not that their currency is in the panther of the fear of his measles 7 then 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.909
 What is wrong is wrong with the US dollar because it is 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.229
 buying far beyond what they can with python with huge deficit then 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:47.279
 lami barrel will plummet will devalue with this america will not have power 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.540
 that will stop consuming will return to save more 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.730
 and will lessen a little problem of them will not solve a go 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.270
 decrease 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.740
 then american farah pines that or not these are well that such mint in the 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.740
 consumers do not have to decrease consumption and increase savings 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.189
 another interesting thing is china imports 4 reached 4 billion barrels 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.179
 day 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:09.469
 this decision because the 11th work 3 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.849
 this decision has no seat to consume it all then Americans 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.269
 they will have to walk in a cart, but rather than stop driving 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.089
 while this month may increase their consumption 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.089
 So it's no use Gonna consume you, you'll have to save 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.320
 another interesting fact 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.500
 the growth of the race and half people for 2011 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.569
 go pump 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.559
 on the other hand, the eurozone has complicated the horticulture of the country 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.890
 there is no way that the monetary union would have political and fiscal 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.519
 the statesman growing more or less because increasing consumption 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.260
 American boy is inflated by the consumer sac and land of the day while 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.220
 they do not save it will not work 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.429
 and if they spared the pib drops 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:50.470
 titan serve and half fanciful 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.370
 latin america is being pulled by gm to people and africa then neither 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.370
 Greater Tacian Arctic Speech by Actual 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.349
 I believe that the Chinese currency cohab will be the new world currency on the dial 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.019
 because I give a weakening note and china counts very well then saving 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:07.520
 very 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.189
 she is getting stronger 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.680
 she just will not push her coin around the world if she does not want to 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.810
 the staff says that the economic situation has hit the tabba tava months 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:19.470
 see here the announcement h of this year 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.790
 is rising as few in the world 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.500
 so the idh situation was also excellent 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.560
 meet the idh not the agenda was considered the home to improve in the world in 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.379
