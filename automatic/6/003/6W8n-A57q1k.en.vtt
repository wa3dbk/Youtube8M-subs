00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
of coverage down in that area the

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.300 
of coverage down in that area the
biggest<00:01:01.810> thing<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:02.050> first<00:01:02.680> year<00:01:02.950> Kenya

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
biggest thing that first year Kenya

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.180 
biggest thing that first year Kenya
jackets<00:01:03.670> going<00:01:03.790> to<00:01:03.850> be<00:01:03.940> great<00:01:04.150> for<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.630> for<00:01:05.560> the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
jackets going to be great for is for the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.460 
jackets going to be great for is for the
wet<00:01:06.610> weather<00:01:06.850> conditions<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.750> outer<00:01:08.050> shell

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
wet weather conditions the outer shell

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.990 
wet weather conditions the outer shell
is<00:01:08.710> actually<00:01:09.040> made<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.280> what<00:01:09.580> they<00:01:09.670> call<00:01:09.850> their

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
is actually made of what they call their

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.120 
is actually made of what they call their
hypertech's<00:01:10.570> material<00:01:11.050> and<00:01:11.290> it's<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.860> water

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
hypertech's material and it's a water

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.490 
hypertech's material and it's a water
proof<00:01:12.729> fabric<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.810> outer<00:01:13.990> shell<00:01:14.470> is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
proof fabric so the outer shell is

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.990 
proof fabric so the outer shell is
actually<00:01:15.100> what's<00:01:15.250> going<00:01:15.399> to<00:01:15.460> keep<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.790> dry

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
actually what's going to keep you dry

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.359 
actually what's going to keep you dry
which<00:01:16.690> means<00:01:16.720> they<00:01:17.080> don't<00:01:17.259> have<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.590> use<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:18.040> mid

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
which means they don't have to use a mid

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.389 
which means they don't have to use a mid
liner<00:01:18.670> for<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.210> rain<00:01:19.750> liner<00:01:20.050> inside<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.979> jacket

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
liner for a rain liner inside the jacket

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.070 
liner for a rain liner inside the jacket
the<00:01:21.580> big<00:01:21.759> advantage<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.300> obviously<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
the big advantage to that obviously the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.750 
the big advantage to that obviously the
outer<00:01:23.259> shell<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.800> jacket<00:01:24.159> isn't<00:01:24.400> going<00:01:24.610> to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
outer shell of the jacket isn't going to

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.000 
outer shell of the jacket isn't going to
get<00:01:24.940> waterlogged<00:01:25.720> soaked<00:01:26.320> down<00:01:26.500> with<00:01:26.710> tons<00:01:26.890> of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
get waterlogged soaked down with tons of

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.380 
get waterlogged soaked down with tons of
water<00:01:27.130> it's<00:01:27.430> not<00:01:27.460> going<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.729> get<00:01:27.820> super<00:01:28.150> heavy

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
water it's not going to get super heavy

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.090 
water it's not going to get super heavy
on<00:01:28.510> you<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.229> other<00:01:29.260> real<00:01:29.710> great

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
on you and the other real great

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.860 
on you and the other real great
advantage<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.880> is<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.570> ventilation

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
advantage to it is the ventilation

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.690 
advantage to it is the ventilation
system<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.740> actually<00:01:33.100> going<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.370> be<00:01:33.460> very

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
system is actually going to be very

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.430 
system is actually going to be very
effective<00:01:34.000> because<00:01:34.390> there's<00:01:34.720> no<00:01:34.960> mid<00:01:35.200> liner

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
effective because there's no mid liner

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.649 
effective because there's no mid liner
to<00:01:35.979> block<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.369> wind<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.299> talking<00:01:37.450> about

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
to block the wind so it's talking about

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.690 
to block the wind so it's talking about
ventilation<00:01:38.049> for<00:01:38.560> summer<00:01:38.740> use<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.430> have

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
ventilation for summer use you have

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.000 
ventilation for summer use you have
zippered<00:01:40.390> vents<00:01:40.750> on<00:01:40.930> these<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.710> these

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
zippered vents on these on these

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.340 
zippered vents on these on these
shoulders<00:01:42.250> here<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:43.420> have<00:01:43.540> underarm<00:01:44.020> vents

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
shoulders here you have underarm vents

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.230 
shoulders here you have underarm vents
as<00:01:44.500> well<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.920> then<00:01:45.400> there's<00:01:45.549> exhaust<00:01:45.880> to

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
as well and then there's exhaust to

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.690 
as well and then there's exhaust to
exhaustion

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
exhaustion

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.399 
exhaustion
at<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.820> back<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.570> you're<00:01:49.690> gonna<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.960> lots<00:01:50.290> of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
at the back so you're gonna get lots of

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.560 
at the back so you're gonna get lots of
airflow<00:01:50.740> through<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.250> jacket<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.940> it's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
airflow through the jacket and it's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.090 
airflow through the jacket and it's
going<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.900> actually<00:01:53.050> get<00:01:53.470> through<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.979> your

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
going to actually get through to your

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.550 
going to actually get through to your
skin<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.640> keep<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.180> comfortable<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.840> warm

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
skin and keep you comfortable in warm

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.590
