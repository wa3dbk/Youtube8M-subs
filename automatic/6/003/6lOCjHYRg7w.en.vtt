00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.950
 previous but I'll also leave them at 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.260
 end many of the nails that you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 they will send so that you too 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.870
 see ready so we go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.870
 antares 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.840
 well remember I'm going to make nails 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.870
 easter so that's why my base is 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.290
 white now I'm going to start making some 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.690
 small as lines or confetti of this 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.150
 way and they're going to be in disarray they 're going to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.670
 be pink green and yellow that 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.310
 this was the palette that I chose for 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.410
 use in my easter eggs here 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.920
 I'm finishing some lines in the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.930
 small holes that were left and ready 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.180
 for this design I'm going to make a bunny 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.860
 it's a design that I found and I 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.290
 It seemed super nice and simple to 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.990
 do so I'm going to make a sphere with 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.700
 the stuffed brush here I'm doing it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.910
 remember that I am always using 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.550
 ordinary enamels you can use 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.500
 the enamels they have in their house now 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.350
 I'm going to make two sticks that are going to imitate 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.350
 the ears of the rabbit 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.799
 for this design we are going to do for a 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.630
 kind of tribal with this palette of 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.930
 then I will make some triangles 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.360
 in this way in zig zag I make a line 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.360
 in zig zag here I'm finishing 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.420
 with green I will simply make a line 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.820
 horizontal in the center and above 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.009
 and if they are fixed with the same brush I'm 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.650
 making a few dots very very 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.650
 little ones in the spaces that I have left 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.090
 Now here I am going to make a chick or a 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.819
 bird or chicken I do not know how they tell you in your 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.069
 country 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.140
 then I will do it in egg shape 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.680
 inspired by him in this era 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.569
 now it's going to be the nose of the rabbit and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.430
 with black I do the points that I am 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.010
 making the same brush very 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.280
 little ones 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.250
 I'm going to make the chicken's spit I come back and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.689
 I repeat the eyes and lines to do the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.689
 legs of this chick 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.189
 although I do it only with the brush 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 then they can do it with the 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.460
 tool they have 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.620
 He stretched his legs a bit and ready and 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.680
 I have my egg-shaped chick 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.840
 here I'm going to make another line a little bit 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.890
 thicker two lines and filling 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.920
 Finished filling something with the sun about 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.900
 points 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.890
 now with yellow I come back and some line 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.010
 in zigzag and I finish you can see 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.920
 different inspirations on the Internet 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.459
 Pasqual nails is very nice because 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.290
 we are inspired to paint the eggs to 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.410
 I liked doing it now I'm 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.810
 ending with a few points clean 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.660
 remember to always apply a new one 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.060
 drying blotter and here is my design 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.190
 Inspired by Easter, I liked it a lot 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.950
