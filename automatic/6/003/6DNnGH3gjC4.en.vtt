navigates through the menu here and very
easy<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.790> use<00:03:46.879> actually<00:03:47.420> takes<00:03:48.079> a<00:03:48.170> little<00:03:48.290> bit

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409

I think to get used to it for some folks
but<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:51.470> me<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.680> felt<00:03:51.769> right<00:03:51.980> at<00:03:52.159> home<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.549> know

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849
