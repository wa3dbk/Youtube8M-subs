00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.600 
very much as in enduro 4 but has been
adapted<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:31.020> these<00:01:31.110> bikes<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:32.460> look

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
adapted for for these bikes but look

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.480 
adapted for for these bikes but look
it's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.790> only<00:01:33.090> been<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> suspension<00:01:33.869> that

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
it's not only been the suspension that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
it's not only been the suspension that
attracted<00:01:35.490> us<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.180> 4<00:01:36.329> PS<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.780> year<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
attracted us to the 4 PS this year and I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
attracted us to the 4 PS this year and I
think<00:01:37.350> made<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:37.920> intriguing<00:01:38.220> test

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
think made it a really intriguing test

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
think made it a really intriguing test
it's<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> bikes<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.350> got

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it's really a lot of the bikes have got

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
it's really a lot of the bikes have got
huge<00:01:41.009> overhauls<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.670> mean<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> Honda<00:01:42.150> for

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
huge overhauls I mean the Honda for

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.639 
huge overhauls I mean the Honda for
instance<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.750> massive<00:01:43.079> overhauls<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
instance it's got massive overhauls to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.550 
instance it's got massive overhauls to
at<00:01:43.740> engine<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.720> Suzuki<00:01:46.200> across<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
board to engine and frame Kawasaki a lot
of<00:01:49.320> tweaks<00:01:49.590> across<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> board<00:01:50.220> again<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> lot

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
of tweaks across the board again a lot

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.200 
of tweaks across the board again a lot
of<00:01:50.939> emphasis<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:52.439> electronics<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:54.060> their

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
of emphasis on on electronics and their

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
of emphasis on on electronics and their
ECU

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
ECU

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
ECU
KTM<00:01:56.640> husky<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.450> tweaks<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.960> suppose<00:01:58.200> they've

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
KTM husky more tweaks I suppose they've

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
KTM husky more tweaks I suppose they've
done<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> lot<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> work<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> guess<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.549> their

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
done a lot of work I guess on their

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
done a lot of work I guess on their
linkage<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> shock<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> really

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
linkage in the shock which is really

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.510 
linkage in the shock which is really
trying<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> change<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> dynamic<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.399> those

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
trying to change the dynamic of those

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.030 
trying to change the dynamic of those
bikes<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.439> it's<00:02:04.439> been<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> very<00:02:04.890> interesting

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
bikes so it's been a very interesting

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
bikes so it's been a very interesting
test<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.700> am<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.829> certainly

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
test and I am it's not just a certainly

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
test and I am it's not just a certainly
wasn't<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.640> matter<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
wasn't just a matter of

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.210 
wasn't just a matter of
upgrading<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.470> bit<00:02:10.590> from<00:02:10.770> last<00:02:10.979> year's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
upgrading a little bit from last year's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.860 
upgrading a little bit from last year's
bikes<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.670> saying<00:02:11.850> hey<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> stepped<00:02:12.390> two

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
bikes and saying hey it stepped two

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
bikes and saying hey it stepped two
degrees<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:13.470> five<00:02:14.069> percent<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:14.550> direction<00:02:14.940> or

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
degrees or five percent one direction or

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.370 
degrees or five percent one direction or
another<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:15.510> were<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.050> lot<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.200> ways

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
another they were in a lot of ways

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.900 
another they were in a lot of ways
completely<00:02:16.860> different<00:02:17.370> bikes<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.610> probably

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
completely different bikes I probably

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.910 
completely different bikes I probably
say<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.270> yeah<00:02:18.450> my<00:02:18.569> eyesight<00:02:18.959> because<00:02:19.110> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
say that yeah my eyesight because that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
say that yeah my eyesight because that
was<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.550> was<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.760> least<00:02:20.970> changed<00:02:21.390> of

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
was the that was the least changed of

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:43.860 
was the that was the least changed of
the<00:02:22.440> six

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.910 

not

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:53.120 

I<00:02:49.810> sense
