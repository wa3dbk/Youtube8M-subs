00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.369
 let's make a good lamb stew but yes 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 with ternasco de aragón with a good leg of shepherds teresita we will 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.149
 also the vegetables artichokes green asparagus and onions to josé 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.800
 I pray the Andean bugle white olive oil salt and pepper let's start 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.430
 cutting the onions into pieces 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.850
 in this case it is a tender onion 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.010
 we will continue peeling 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.320
 the garlics 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 and itching is important that you carry a good amount of garlic 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.810
 that will give him a lot of character 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.780
 you see we introduce everything in the operas 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 and then we put a good virgin oil waiting for you 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.310
 important that we do not go through with the amount of oil because in turn the 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.780
 ternasco will loose fat 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.080
 and if we pass, we will see how the part of 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 above the floor and it is quite unpleasant 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.409
 let's continue cutting the pieces that leg of Aragon ternasco 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.410
 good looking has the spokesperson to pieces that you see us we have put 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.520
 more or less 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340
 in one bite 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 i love the vegetables here the artichoke the main vegetable we quote 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.530
 those external sheets 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.259
 the duration is to give birth 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.270
 heart 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 that we chop we know the same with the green asparagus of rice and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.460
 protect them all that to her the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.439
 We have to fatten the cali for that we add a little flour 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.820
 when we read flour we must be careful not to stick 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 He warned the pan, so we remove it well 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 we will complete with a little white wine 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.120
 and let's cook 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.110
