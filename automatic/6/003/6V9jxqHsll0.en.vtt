and obviously you could swap the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.810 
and obviously you could swap the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
there's plenty of bits left but I was

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.570 
there's plenty of bits left but I was
actually<00:02:17.770> thinking<00:02:17.950> they'd<00:02:18.250> be<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.430> good

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580

foundation<00:02:18.730> for<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.420> bit<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:21.250> know<00:02:21.280> more

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
foundation for a bit of a you know more

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940 
foundation for a bit of a you know more
substantial<00:02:22.870> structure<00:02:23.290> there<00:02:23.440> since<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.830> is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
substantial structure there since it is

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.100 
substantial structure there since it is
you<00:02:24.370> know<00:02:24.490> pretty<00:02:24.819> much<00:02:24.910> mid-table<00:02:25.480> there<00:02:25.870> and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
you know pretty much mid-table there and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.410 
you know pretty much mid-table there and
they're<00:02:26.950> simple<00:02:27.520> tumble<00:02:27.819> down<00:02:27.880> one<00:02:28.090> wall

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420

and that's for most of the table votes
all<00:03:24.820> right

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
all right

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
oh I'd have to cut it there for a sec

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.860 
oh I'd have to cut it there for a sec
because<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.910> was<00:03:28.030> zooming<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.510> like<00:03:28.660> an<00:03:28.780> idiot

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
because I was zooming in like an idiot

because I was zooming in like an idiot
not<00:03:29.230> paying<00:03:29.410> attention<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.950> camera<00:03:30.250> but

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
oh yeah most of the table is this it's

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.820 
oh yeah most of the table is this it's
pretty<00:03:36.010> nice<00:03:36.190> goes<00:03:36.489> all<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.700> way<00:03:36.820> around<00:03:37.830> even

this a couple of sandbags there on the
main<00:04:26.550> bridge<00:04:27.139> that's<00:04:28.139> all<00:04:28.320> death<00:04:28.530> clay<00:04:28.800> which

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
main bridge that's all death clay which

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.370 
main bridge that's all death clay which
is<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.449> great<00:04:30.449> and<00:04:30.600> it's<00:04:30.720> held<00:04:30.900> up<00:04:30.990> really<00:04:31.229> well

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
is a great and it's held up really well

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.840 
is a great and it's held up really well
on<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.710> stuff<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:32.039> made<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.220> games<00:04:32.460> workshop

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
on the stuff I made a games workshop

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.810 
on the stuff I made a games workshop
over<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.240> years<00:04:33.449> so<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:34.430> don't<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:35.610> I<00:04:35.639> don't

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
over the years so I don't know I don't

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.070 
over the years so I don't know I don't
think<00:04:35.850> it's<00:04:36.060> gonna<00:04:36.180> be<00:04:36.360> chipping<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:36.750> falling

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
think it's gonna be chipping and falling

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.570 
think it's gonna be chipping and falling
off<00:04:37.199> on<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.620> if<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.949> does<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:38.280> not<00:04:38.340> gonna

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
off on you and if it does it's not gonna

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.510 
off on you and if it does it's not gonna
crumble<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:40.620> can<00:04:40.800> just<00:04:40.949> glue<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.190> straight

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
crumble so you can just glue it straight

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.879 
crumble so you can just glue it straight
back<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:42.630> plaster<00:04:43.020> will<00:04:43.169> crumble<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.710> bit

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
back on the plaster will crumble a bit

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.920 
back on the plaster will crumble a bit
because<00:04:44.729> it's<00:04:44.850> not<00:04:45.000> as<00:04:45.090> good<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.389> desk<00:04:45.630> but

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
because it's not as good as the desk but

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.230 
because it's not as good as the desk but
nowhere<00:04:46.860> near<00:04:47.039> enough<00:04:47.070> for<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.729> notice<00:04:47.970> up

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
nowhere near enough for you to notice up

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.420 
nowhere near enough for you to notice up
here<00:04:48.270> really<00:04:48.860> unless<00:04:49.860> you're<00:04:50.039> gonna<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.280> going

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
here really unless you're gonna be going

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.060 
here really unless you're gonna be going
over<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.760> with<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> microscope<00:04:51.419> but<00:04:51.690> now<00:04:52.560> all

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
over it with a microscope but now all

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.219 
over it with a microscope but now all
these<00:04:53.310> foam<00:04:53.580> core<00:04:53.820> buildings<00:04:54.180> since<00:04:54.960> we<00:04:55.080> use

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
these foam core buildings since we use

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.219 
these foam core buildings since we use
this<00:04:55.410> table<00:04:56.030> mostly<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.300> lot<00:04:57.539> of<00:04:57.599> 40k<00:04:57.930> got

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
this table mostly a lot of 40k got

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.860 
this table mostly a lot of 40k got
played<00:04:58.410> on<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.620> as<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.889> can<00:04:59.010> see<00:04:59.240> but<00:05:00.240> um<00:05:00.449> is

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
played on that as you can see but um is

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.420 
played on that as you can see but um is
mostly<00:05:01.320> more<00:05:01.470> time<00:05:01.680> because<00:05:01.860> for<00:05:02.099> more<00:05:02.220> time

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
mostly more time because for more time

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.159 
mostly more time because for more time
you<00:05:02.550> need<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.729> table<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.389> magnitude<00:05:04.050> and

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
you need a table of this magnitude and

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.820 
you need a table of this magnitude and
detail<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:05.280> truly<00:05:05.669> get<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:06.530> awesomeness<00:05:07.530> out

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
detail to truly get the awesomeness out

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.640 
detail to truly get the awesomeness out

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
a proper game no mucking around trying

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.460 
a proper game no mucking around trying
to<00:05:22.819> reach<00:05:23.000> through<00:05:23.300> gaps<00:05:23.569> in<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.780> crap

get in there it will come off same
around<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.270> side<00:05:36.570> here<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:38.550> sweet<00:05:38.850> doing<00:05:39.390> it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
around the side here this sweet doing it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.170 
around the side here this sweet doing it
at<00:05:39.930> a<00:05:39.990> lot<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.170> good<00:05:40.350> battles<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.710> this<00:05:40.830> one

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
at a lot of good battles in this one

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.610 
at a lot of good battles in this one
better<00:05:42.180> look<00:05:42.390> off<00:05:42.570> this<00:05:42.810> one's<00:05:42.990> got<00:05:43.170> interior

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
better look off this one's got interior

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.230 
better look off this one's got interior
walls<00:05:43.890> as<00:05:44.340> well<00:05:44.550> added<00:05:45.210> bonus<00:05:45.540> as<00:05:46.940> does<00:05:47.940> that

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
walls as well added bonus as does that

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.240 
walls as well added bonus as does that
one<00:05:48.480> fire<00:05:48.840> over<00:05:49.140> there<00:05:49.350> that's<00:05:49.620> good<00:05:49.830> interior

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
one fire over there that's good interior

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.320 
one fire over there that's good interior
walls<00:05:50.780> and<00:05:52.010> these<00:05:53.010> ones<00:05:53.310> don't<00:05:53.610> have<00:05:53.790> interior

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
walls and these ones don't have interior

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.130 
walls and these ones don't have interior
walls<00:05:54.510> I'll<00:05:54.750> come<00:05:54.900> around<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.170> outside<00:05:57.140> but

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
walls I'll come around the outside but

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.140 
walls I'll come around the outside but
it<00:05:58.560> would<00:05:58.710> be<00:05:58.830> quite<00:05:59.070> easy<00:05:59.100> to<00:05:59.340> put<00:05:59.580> them<00:05:59.700> in<00:05:59.820> it

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
it would be quite easy to put them in it

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.940
