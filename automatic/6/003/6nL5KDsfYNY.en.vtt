currently getting for the negotiations
but<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:27.240> channel<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:27.979> labeled<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> Tier<00:01:29.460> one

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
but my channel was labeled as a Tier one
channel<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> them<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.049> very<00:01:31.229> large<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.950> I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310

creators so Eric hadn't mentioned that
to<00:02:54.489> me<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:55.449> was<00:02:55.900> stuck<00:02:56.379> because<00:02:56.530> most<00:02:56.859> of<00:02:56.919> my

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
to me so I was stuck because most of my

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.670 
to me so I was stuck because most of my
views<00:02:57.219> are<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.459> Vietnamese<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.750> my

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
views are in Vietnamese and so in my

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.459 
views are in Vietnamese and so in my
opinion<00:03:02.769> if<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:04.090> guys<00:03:04.239> are<00:03:04.930> thinking<00:03:05.199> about
