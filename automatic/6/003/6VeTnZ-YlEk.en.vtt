00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
interface that we have a different

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.339 
interface that we have a different
prototype<00:00:11.070> unit<00:00:11.309> where<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.300> see<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
prototype unit where we can see what the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.110 
prototype unit where we can see what the
interface<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> experience<00:00:14.670> looks<00:00:14.910> like

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
interface and experience looks like

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
interface and experience looks like
beyond<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.599> opening<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.260> single<00:00:16.590> textbook<00:00:16.949> so

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
beyond just opening a single textbook so

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.800 
beyond just opening a single textbook so
barbour<00:00:17.910> why<00:00:18.029> don't<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.270> show<00:00:18.449> me<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.720> you
