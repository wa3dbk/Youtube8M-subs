this out over the pool lower it down

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.629 
this out over the pool lower it down
into<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> pool<00:00:07.470> will<00:00:07.799> actually<00:00:08.099> take<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.490> air

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
into the pool will actually take the air

facing<00:00:58.410> pool<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> deep<00:00:59.550> end

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
facing pool we're at the deep end

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
facing pool we're at the deep end
the<00:01:00.180> arrows<00:01:00.449> facing<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> pool<00:01:01.170> our<00:01:01.590> next<00:01:01.920> step

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the arrows facing the pool our next step

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.529 
the arrows facing the pool our next step
is<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> board<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> sort<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
is we put a board here of sort of a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
is we put a board here of sort of a
platform<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.229> help<00:01:04.409> us<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> give<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> surface<00:01:05.309> as

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
platform to help us to give a surface as

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
platform to help us to give a surface as
we<00:01:05.640> unroll<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.260> pull

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we unroll it right and then we just pull

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.840 
we unroll it right and then we just pull
it<00:01:07.590> across<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.010> pool<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.400> let's<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it across the pool so let's see what I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
it across the pool so let's see what I
hit<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.270> position<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.049> okay<00:01:12.500> once

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
hit it into position all right okay once

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
hit it into position all right okay once
the<00:01:13.680> liner<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.010> been<00:01:14.280> carefully<00:01:14.729> placed<00:01:14.939> on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the liner has been carefully placed on

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
the liner has been carefully placed on
the<00:01:15.299> pool<00:01:15.479> bottom<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.380> begin<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.830> task<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the pool bottom we can begin the task of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
the pool bottom we can begin the task of
snapping<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> liner<00:01:18.000> bead<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> liner

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
snapping the liner bead into the liner

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.499 
snapping the liner bead into the liner
track<00:01:19.290> after<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.310> liner<00:01:20.549> bead<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.970> completely

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
track after the liner bead is completely

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.600 
track after the liner bead is completely
installed<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> liner<00:01:22.409> track<00:01:22.770> adjust<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
installed in the liner track adjust the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
installed in the liner track adjust the
liner<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> pool<00:01:24.420> corners<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.080> required<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
liner in the pool corners as required to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
liner in the pool corners as required to
achieve<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.400> smooth<00:01:26.820> loose<00:01:27.270> fit<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
achieve a smooth loose fit in the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.520 
achieve a smooth loose fit in the
corners<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.130> turn<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> vacuum<00:01:33.530> all

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
corners then we turn on the vacuum all

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
corners then we turn on the vacuum all
right<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
right that's good so you can see that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
right that's good so you can see that
I've<00:01:36.780> sealed<00:01:37.049> off<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> top<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> skimmer

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I've sealed off the top of the skimmer

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.679
