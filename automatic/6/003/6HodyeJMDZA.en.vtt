00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
in the leisure travel free-spirit

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.979 
in the leisure travel free-spirit
there's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> cabinet<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.149> sticks<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
there's a cabinet that sticks out in the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.959 
there's a cabinet that sticks out in the
back<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.590> GT<00:00:41.309> near<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
back there the GT near the top and that

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.110 
back there the GT near the top and that
protruded<00:00:44.969> beyond<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> area<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
protruded beyond the area where you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
protruded beyond the area where you
would<00:00:48.239> attach<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> frame<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
would attach it to the frame so it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
would attach it to the frame so it
caused<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> material<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> punch<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
caused the material a punch up some and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.549 
caused the material a punch up some and
it<00:00:53.370> also<00:00:53.550> made<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:53.969> difficult<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.899> our

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it also made it difficult to get our

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.729 
it also made it difficult to get our
screwdrivers<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:58.140> screw<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> screws

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
screwdrivers and to screw in the screws

screwdrivers and to screw in the screws
on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> bottom<00:01:02.149> we<00:01:03.149> had<00:01:04.010> Kenter<00:01:05.010> put<00:01:05.339> on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on the bottom we had Kenter put on

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
on the bottom we had Kenter put on
velcro<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.689> stuck<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.799> opposite

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
velcro and then I stuck the opposite

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
velcro and then I stuck the opposite
don't<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.850> along<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.360> bottom<00:01:09.799> we<00:01:10.799> tried

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
don't go along the bottom we tried

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.460 
don't go along the bottom we tried
different<00:01:11.310> things<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:12.210> attaching<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.640 

current<00:01:16.470> material<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> body<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> van

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
current material to the body of the van

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
current material to the body of the van
ended<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.830> using<00:01:20.479> plumber's<00:01:21.479> tape<00:01:21.720> with

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
ended up using plumber's tape with

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
ended up using plumber's tape with
screws<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.830> known<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.460> was

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
screws if we would have known it was

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
screws if we would have known it was
gonna<00:01:26.790> work<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.840> how<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.290> gonna<00:01:28.439> work

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
gonna work and on how it was gonna work

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.190 
gonna work and on how it was gonna work
we<00:01:29.070> could<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.509> probably<00:01:30.509> done<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> better<00:01:31.079> job

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we could have probably done a better job

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
we could have probably done a better job
but<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> don't<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> because

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
but as it is you don't see it because

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
but as it is you don't see it because
the<00:01:35.909> doors<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.390> closed<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.310> inside

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the doors are closed and from the inside

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.240 
the doors are closed and from the inside
it<00:01:39.329> looks<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.530> can't<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> at

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it looks really good you can't see it at

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.279 
it looks really good you can't see it at
all<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> course<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.270> plumbers<00:01:42.689> tape

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
all of course the plumbers tape

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.910 
all of course the plumbers tape
now<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:45.350> did<00:01:45.619> pull<00:01:45.859> out<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.750> plugs<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.200> plug

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
now we did pull out the plugs that plug

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.389 
now we did pull out the plugs that plug
the<00:01:49.070> holes<00:01:49.310> along<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.649> rim<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.250> we

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
the holes along that the rim that we

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.940 
the holes along that the rim that we
attach<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.170> because<00:01:54.170> they<00:01:54.350> would<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.649> caused

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
attach to because they would have caused

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.410 
attach to because they would have caused
a<00:01:55.789> more<00:01:56.719> uneven<00:01:57.250> situation<00:01:58.420> actually

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
a more uneven situation actually

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.059 
a more uneven situation actually
originally<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.110> thought<00:02:00.380> we'd<00:02:00.590> use<00:02:00.829> those

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
originally we thought we'd use those

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.160 
originally we thought we'd use those
holes<00:02:01.429> and<00:02:01.700> screw<00:02:01.880> them<00:02:02.299> but<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.810> didn't

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
holes and screw them but that didn't

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.089 
holes and screw them but that didn't
work<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:06.049> course<00:02:06.319> there's<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:09.099> doorstop

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
work out of course there's the doorstop

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.339 
work out of course there's the doorstop
brackets<00:02:11.090> whatever<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.629> call<00:02:11.900> them<00:02:12.140> that

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
brackets whatever you call them that

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.690 
brackets whatever you call them that
allow<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:14.590> either<00:02:15.590> keep<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.069> doors<00:02:16.400> in

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
allow you to either keep the doors in

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:26.170 
allow you to either keep the doors in
the<00:02:16.819> straight<00:02:17.150> out<00:02:17.329> position<00:02:17.989> or<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:25.430> cut

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the straight out position or we cut

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.479 
the straight out position or we cut
around<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.720> brackets<00:02:27.440> as<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:27.860> install<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
around the brackets as we install the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.479 
around the brackets as we install the
material<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:29.420> actually<00:02:31.599> came<00:02:32.599> out<00:02:32.840> with<00:02:33.260> a

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
material and it actually came out with a

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.979 
material and it actually came out with a
considerably<00:02:34.489> tighter<00:02:34.849> fit<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.629> is<00:02:35.780> on<00:02:35.959> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
considerably tighter fit and is on the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.330 
considerably tighter fit and is on the
road<00:02:36.319> track<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.750> another<00:02:39.680> view<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
road track this is another view the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.759 
road track this is another view the
other<00:02:40.489> side<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.290> problems

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
other side I think if we have problems

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.470 
other side I think if we have problems
with<00:02:45.890> bugs<00:02:46.190> getting<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.730> we'll<00:02:47.000> figure<00:02:47.269> out<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
with bugs getting in we'll figure out a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.099 
with bugs getting in we'll figure out a
way<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.750> take<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:50.030> plug<00:02:50.269> up<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.600> holes<00:02:50.780> when

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
way to take to plug up the holes when

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.820 
way to take to plug up the holes when
the<00:02:51.230> bride<00:02:51.470> gets<00:02:51.739> cut<00:02:52.069> off<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:53.510> view<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.170> the

see how the rim is screwed in with the
plumber's<00:03:06.370> tape<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.849> just<00:03:10.150> another<00:03:10.420> view

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
plumber's tape this is just another view

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.509 
plumber's tape this is just another view
looks<00:03:12.209> velcroed<00:03:13.209> bottom<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.220> middle

looks velcroed bottom in the middle
there

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
there

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.740 
there
classic<00:03:17.260> attend<00:03:17.560> tarp<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.819> can<00:03:19.120> attach<00:03:19.480> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
velcro to the screen and I stuck a wider

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.589 
velcro to the screen and I stuck a wider

strip actually a Velcro to them well
there<00:03:27.599> finally<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.830> in<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.370> view<00:03:30.610> where

you can see the cabinet outlooks with

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.259 
you can see the cabinet outlooks with
the<00:03:38.019> doors<00:03:38.230> open<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:39.130> close<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.849> don't<00:03:40.000> see

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
the doors open to close you don't see

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:48.020 
the doors open to close you don't see
any<00:03:40.390> pores

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.700 

this<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.660> view<00:03:49.810> from<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.140> inside<00:03:50.260> of

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
this is the view from the inside of

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.510 
this is the view from the inside of
course<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:53.380> can<00:03:53.560> see<00:03:53.740> there<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.190> scene

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
course and you can see there the scene

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.660 
course and you can see there the scene
that<00:03:55.000> comes<00:03:55.210> down<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.840> was<00:03:56.110> caused<00:03:56.950> by<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.370> Mis

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
that comes down that was caused by a Mis

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.450 
that comes down that was caused by a Mis
measurement<00:03:58.270> on<00:03:58.420> my<00:03:58.690> part<00:03:59.020> after<00:03:59.980> they

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
measurement on my part after they

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.690 
measurement on my part after they
originally<00:04:01.230> fabricated<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.700> mesquita

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
originally fabricated the mesquita

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.540 
originally fabricated the mesquita
screen<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.690> outside<00:04:05.350> material<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:06.280> found

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
screen and the outside material I found

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.090 
screen and the outside material I found
that<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.910> had<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.900> screen<00:04:08.230> four<00:04:08.560> inches<00:04:08.860> too

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
that I had the screen four inches too

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.130 
that I had the screen four inches too
wide<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:09.910> they<00:04:10.030> had<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.330> take<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.930> out

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
wide and so they had to take that out

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.510 
wide and so they had to take that out
which<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.370> course<00:04:12.430> produced<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.300> seam<00:04:14.520> they

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
which of course produced the seam they

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.610 
which of course produced the seam they
did<00:04:15.700> as<00:04:15.820> well<00:04:15.970> as<00:04:16.030> they<00:04:16.270> could<00:04:16.540> but<00:04:16.810> even<00:04:17.320> after

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
did as well as they could but even after

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.039 
did as well as they could but even after
they<00:04:17.770> were<00:04:17.830> done<00:04:18.040> modifying<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.720> didn't

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
they were done modifying it it didn't

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.010 
they were done modifying it it didn't
look<00:04:20.170> quite<00:04:20.350> as<00:04:20.739> pretty<00:04:20.980> as<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.370> did<00:04:21.720> before<00:04:22.720> it

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
look quite as pretty as it did before it

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200 
look quite as pretty as it did before it
was<00:04:23.200> modified<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:24.010> terms<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.430> me<00:04:24.610> perfectly

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
was modified in terms of me perfectly

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.290 
was modified in terms of me perfectly
flat<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:26.170> don't<00:04:26.710> think<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.160> has<00:04:27.430> anything<00:04:28.090> to

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
flat I don't think that has anything to

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.390 
flat I don't think that has anything to
do<00:04:28.540> with<00:04:28.570> how<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:28.960> looks<00:04:29.290> for<00:04:29.530> inside<00:04:30.070> other

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
do with how it looks for inside other

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.950 
do with how it looks for inside other
than<00:04:30.730> seeing<00:04:31.530> however<00:04:36.030> here's<00:04:37.030> an<00:04:37.360> attempt<00:04:37.810> to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
than seeing however here's an attempt to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.890 
than seeing however here's an attempt to
join<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.560> corners<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.390> little<00:04:40.660> dark

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
join you the corners it's a little dark

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.590 
join you the corners it's a little dark
but<00:04:41.290> what<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.830> see<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.400> looks<00:04:43.330> pretty

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
but what you can see is it looks pretty

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.630 
but what you can see is it looks pretty
much<00:04:43.690> like<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.140> professional<00:04:44.920> job<00:04:45.190> from<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
much like a professional job from the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.750 
much like a professional job from the
inside<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.980> bunched<00:04:47.980> up<00:04:48.100> stuff<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.490> don't

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
inside and bunched up stuff you don't

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.700 
inside and bunched up stuff you don't
see<00:04:48.910> but<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.360> does<00:04:49.540> give<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.110> advantage

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
see but it does give you the advantage

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.700 
see but it does give you the advantage
of<00:04:50.860> having<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.370> back<00:04:51.640> on<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.150> cabinet<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:53.470> top

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
of having a back on that cabinet the top

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.750 
of having a back on that cabinet the top
half<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.340> cabinet<00:04:54.880> actually<00:04:55.360> was<00:04:55.930> open

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
half of that cabinet actually was open

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.630 
half of that cabinet actually was open
completely<00:04:57.760> before<00:04:58.480> but<00:04:58.810> now<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.170> has<00:04:59.640> fabric

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
completely before but now it has fabric

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.570 
completely before but now it has fabric
back<00:05:00.910> which<00:05:01.330> i<00:05:01.660> think<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:02.490> actually<00:05:03.490> an

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
back which i think is actually an

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.020 
back which i think is actually an
improvement

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.050 

the<00:05:08.030> screens<00:05:08.389> zip<00:05:09.349> out<00:05:09.530> in<00:05:10.069> fact<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.639> can<00:05:10.819> zip

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
the screens zip out in fact you can zip

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.420 
the screens zip out in fact you can zip
them<00:05:11.180> all<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.539> way<00:05:11.689> off<00:05:11.979> they<00:05:12.979> hook<00:05:13.250> at<00:05:13.370> the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
them all the way off they hook at the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.219 
them all the way off they hook at the
bottom<00:05:13.909> they're<00:05:14.150> one-way<00:05:14.509> zippers<00:05:15.020> they're

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
bottom they're one-way zippers they're

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.770 
bottom they're one-way zippers they're
not<00:05:15.409> two-way<00:05:15.800> zipper<00:05:15.830> but<00:05:16.699> I<00:05:17.030> don't<00:05:17.330> see<00:05:17.539> why

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.290 

that<00:05:36.620> little<00:05:36.830> hole<00:05:37.159> there<00:05:37.400> actually<00:05:37.879> closes

that little hole there actually closes

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.179 
that little hole there actually closes
up<00:05:38.479> better<00:05:38.750> when<00:05:38.960> you<00:05:39.110> pay<00:05:39.319> attention<00:05:39.349> to<00:05:40.039> it

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:40.189 
up better when you pay attention to it

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.129 
up better when you pay attention to it
but<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.580> was<00:05:40.729> holding<00:05:40.969> the<00:05:41.210> camera<00:05:41.479> and<00:05:41.810> doing

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
but I was holding the camera and doing

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:42.939 
but I was holding the camera and doing
it<00:05:42.319> though

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
it though

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:49.420 
it though
I<00:05:42.979> didn't<00:05:43.939> do<00:05:44.060> much<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.479> job<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.740> reason<00:05:49.219> we

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
I didn't do much of job the reason we

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.110 
I didn't do much of job the reason we
like<00:05:49.699> the<00:05:50.240> screen<00:05:50.599> so<00:05:51.590> much<00:05:51.860> is<00:05:52.159> because<00:05:52.400> it

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
like the screen so much is because it

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.459 
like the screen so much is because it
provides<00:05:53.979> quite<00:05:54.979> a<00:05:55.460> bit<00:05:55.819> more<00:05:56.029> ventilation

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
provides quite a bit more ventilation

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.279 
provides quite a bit more ventilation
than<00:05:57.469> is<00:05:57.860> already<00:05:58.159> available<00:05:59.139> through<00:06:00.139> the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
many windows and the fact that you could

many windows and the fact that you could
get<00:06:06.050> that<00:06:06.229> ventilation<00:06:06.770> while<00:06:07.610> you're

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
get that ventilation while you're

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.719 
get that ventilation while you're
sleeping<00:06:08.389> without<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:09.800> no<00:06:09.919> concern<00:06:10.400> for<00:06:10.430> the

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
place filling up with bugs I suppose

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.490 
place filling up with bugs I suppose
there's<00:06:13.039> places<00:06:13.310> in<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.930> US<00:06:14.930> where<00:06:15.199> you<00:06:15.289> don't

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
there's places in the US where you don't

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.930 
there's places in the US where you don't
worry<00:06:15.710> about<00:06:16.009> them<00:06:16.159> but<00:06:16.339> certainly<00:06:16.520> here<00:06:16.909> in

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
worry about them but certainly here in

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.619 
worry about them but certainly here in
the<00:06:17.120> last<00:06:17.330> news<00:06:17.990> you<00:06:18.379> can<00:06:18.529> see<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:19.009> bed<00:06:19.219> is

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
the last news you can see the bed is

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.890 
the last news you can see the bed is
powering<00:06:20.629> down<00:06:20.990> right<00:06:21.469> there<00:06:22.419> and<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.690> free

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
powering down right there and the free

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.320 
powering down right there and the free
spirit<00:06:24.229> of<00:06:24.560> that<00:06:25.339> is<00:06:25.550> really<00:06:25.729> quite<00:06:25.969> large

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
spirit of that is really quite large

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.230 
spirit of that is really quite large
especially<00:06:26.750> when<00:06:27.289> you<00:06:27.409> fill<00:06:27.650> it<00:06:27.830> in<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.009> hole

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
especially when you fill it in the hole

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.300 
especially when you fill it in the hole
with<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.900> table<00:06:30.259> and<00:06:30.440> cushions<00:06:30.889> although

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
with the table and cushions although

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.659 
with the table and cushions although
that's<00:06:31.520> not<00:06:32.139> necessary<00:06:33.310> you<00:06:34.310> can<00:06:34.460> actually

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
that's not necessary you can actually

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.179 
that's not necessary you can actually
sleep<00:06:35.180> with<00:06:35.479> your<00:06:35.689> legs<00:06:35.900> on<00:06:36.139> one<00:06:36.189> individual

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:37.189 
sleep with your legs on one individual

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:44.110 
sleep with your legs on one individual
side<00:06:37.729> things<00:06:38.680> quite<00:06:39.680> well<00:06:42.219> again<00:06:43.219> I<00:06:43.520> regret

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
side things quite well again I regret

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.019 
side things quite well again I regret
the<00:06:44.659> seam<00:06:44.900> in<00:06:45.139> the<00:06:45.169> screen<00:06:45.560> but<00:06:45.949> that's<00:06:46.639> my

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:47.029 
the seam in the screen but that's my

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:52.480 
the seam in the screen but that's my
flaw<00:06:48.339> so<00:06:49.339> all<00:06:49.490> in<00:06:49.639> all<00:06:49.759> I<00:06:50.120> was<00:06:51.159> quite<00:06:52.159> pleased

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
flaw so all in all I was quite pleased

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.339 
flaw so all in all I was quite pleased
with<00:06:52.729> how<00:06:52.879> it<00:06:53.029> came<00:06:53.060> out<00:06:53.509> and<00:06:53.870> took<00:06:54.020> about<00:06:54.169> a

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
with how it came out and took about a

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.510 
with how it came out and took about a
day's<00:06:54.680> worth<00:06:55.159> of<00:06:55.310> time<00:06:56.110> for<00:06:57.110> us<00:06:57.259> to<00:06:57.529> figure<00:06:58.219> it

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
day's worth of time for us to figure it

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.879 
day's worth of time for us to figure it
out<00:06:58.669> and<00:06:58.969> be<00:06:59.029> install<00:06:59.750> and<00:07:00.020> I<00:07:00.169> think<00:07:00.409> with

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 
out and be install and I think with

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.649 
out and be install and I think with
people<00:07:01.250> who<00:07:01.339> knew<00:07:01.550> how<00:07:01.729> to<00:07:01.759> do<00:07:02.089> it<00:07:02.240> and<00:07:02.479> knew

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:02.659 
people who knew how to do it and knew

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.110 
people who knew how to do it and knew
how<00:07:02.839> they<00:07:02.990> were<00:07:03.050> going<00:07:03.409> to<00:07:03.589> do<00:07:03.710> it<00:07:03.860> rather<00:07:04.120> and

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
how they were going to do it rather and

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.209 
how they were going to do it rather and
who<00:07:05.330> had<00:07:05.539> a<00:07:05.569> proper<00:07:06.169> screwdriver<00:07:06.710> with<00:07:07.069> an
