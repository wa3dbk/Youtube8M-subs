and<00:02:59.100> then<00:02:59.370> by<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.700> time<00:02:59.760> they're<00:03:00.330> they're

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and then by that time they're they're

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.110 
and then by that time they're they're
trying<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.050> come<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.670> were<00:03:02.820> thinking

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
trying to come on so you were thinking

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.490 
trying to come on so you were thinking
as<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.239> doctor<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.750> at<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.350> particular

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
as a doctor that at that particular

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.070 
as a doctor that at that particular
moment<00:03:04.920> yeah<00:03:05.310> more<00:03:05.760> than<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.000> player<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.540> think

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
moment yeah more than a player I think

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.470 
moment yeah more than a player I think
so<00:03:07.260> because<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.920> they<00:03:08.790> were<00:03:08.940> attacking<00:03:09.269> at

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so because the they were attacking at

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.479 
so because the they were attacking at
the<00:03:09.540> time<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.590> team<00:03:10.800> looked<00:03:10.980> serious<00:03:11.340> at

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the time and the team looked serious at

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.000 
the time and the team looked serious at
the<00:03:11.550> time<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.060> was<00:03:12.180> naturally<00:03:12.870> concerned<00:03:13.230> as

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the time so I was naturally concerned as

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.690 
the time so I was naturally concerned as
a<00:03:14.070> medical<00:03:14.519> man<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.260> what<00:03:16.440> once

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
a medical man but you know what once

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.880 
a medical man but you know what once
he's<00:03:17.700> trying<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.450> doctor<00:03:19.019> he<00:03:19.110> come<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:19.650> I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
he's trying to doctor he come on then I

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.440 
he's trying to doctor he come on then I
chain<00:03:20.280> right<00:03:20.519> off<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.790> went<00:03:20.940> back<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.239> thing

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
chain right off and went back the thing

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.910 
chain right off and went back the thing
in<00:03:21.570> football<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.580> could<00:03:23.760> stamp<00:03:24.150> out<00:03:24.420> any

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
in football if you could stamp out any

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.920 
in football if you could stamp out any
practice<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.070> football<00:03:26.519> any<00:03:26.790> type<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.450> injury

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
practice in football any type of injury

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.699 
practice in football any type of injury
what<00:03:28.260> would<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.500> be

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
what would it be

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.630 
what would it be
I<00:03:28.950> think<00:03:29.880> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
I think the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.440 
I think the
the<00:03:30.970> worst<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:32.440> where<00:03:32.800> wires<00:03:33.700> currents

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
the worst is where wires currents

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.090 
the worst is where wires currents
occasionally<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.230> doesn't<00:03:35.620> have<00:03:35.710> very<00:03:35.890> often

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
occasionally it doesn't have very often

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.860 
occasionally it doesn't have very often
