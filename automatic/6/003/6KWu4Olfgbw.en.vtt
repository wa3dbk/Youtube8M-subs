00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
for me I think the test cefiro are

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.530 
for me I think the test cefiro are

so<00:03:43.430> what<00:03:43.670> you're<00:03:43.790> saying<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.439> I'm<00:03:45.439> just

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
so what you're saying is it I'm just

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.349 
so what you're saying is it I'm just
asking<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:46.129> you<00:03:46.220> think<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.549> move<00:03:46.790> against<00:03:47.209> a

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359

Greek<00:03:47.659> draws<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.230> impractical<00:03:48.980> no<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:49.489> think

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
Greek draws is impractical no I think

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.460 
Greek draws is impractical no I think
it's<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.120> think<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.390> fine<00:03:50.659> as<00:03:50.840> long<00:03:50.870> as<00:03:51.200> long

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
it's I think it's fine as long as long

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.899 
it's I think it's fine as long as long
as<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.920> know<00:03:52.010> when<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.489> reach<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.760> position

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
as you know when you reach a position

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.520 
as you know when you reach a position
like<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.420> one<00:03:53.540> we<00:03:53.659> have<00:03:53.810> here<00:03:53.840> where<00:03:54.409> it's

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
like the one we have here where it's

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.110 
like the one we have here where it's
just<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.829> complete<00:03:55.159> draw<00:03:55.400> flirts<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:55.940> take<00:03:56.090> a

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
just to complete draw flirts can take a

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640 
just to complete draw flirts can take a
draw<00:03:56.329> i<00:03:56.359> mean<00:03:56.599> as<00:03:56.690> well<00:03:56.840> as<00:03:56.959> long<00:03:57.139> as<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.440> as

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
draw i mean as well as long as you as

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.649 
draw i mean as well as long as you as
long<00:03:57.859> as<00:03:57.889> it's<00:03:58.069> okay<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.400> take<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.359> drawn<00:03:59.629> a

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
long as it's okay to take a drawn a

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.360 
long as it's okay to take a drawn a
theoretical<00:04:00.349> position<00:04:00.769> like<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:00.980> where

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
theoretical position like this where

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.349 
theoretical position like this where
it's<00:04:01.459> working<00:04:01.730> three<00:04:01.879> against<00:04:02.090> working

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
it's working three against working

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.119 
it's working three against working
through<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.599> into<00:04:02.840> rules<00:04:03.049> fine<00:04:03.319> I<00:04:03.560> mean<00:04:03.980> but<00:04:04.069> if

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
through it into rules fine I mean but if

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.649 
through it into rules fine I mean but if
for<00:04:04.340> example<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:04.909> words<00:04:05.150> say<00:04:05.359> you<00:04:05.420> have

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
for example the you words say you have

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.119 
for example the you words say you have
to<00:04:05.870> play<00:04:06.019> no<00:04:06.170> matter<00:04:06.290> what<00:04:06.590> till<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.829> very<00:04:06.980> end

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
to play no matter what till the very end

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.580 
to play no matter what till the very end
I<00:04:07.430> don't<00:04:07.670> think<00:04:07.760> that's<00:04:08.000> practical<00:04:08.659> so<00:04:09.500> as

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
I don't think that's practical so as

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.410 
I don't think that's practical so as
long<00:04:09.920> as<00:04:10.129> they<00:04:10.280> allow<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.909> take<00:04:11.150> drawers

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
long as they allow you to take drawers

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.059 
long as they allow you to take drawers
and<00:04:11.689> I<00:04:11.870> mean<00:04:12.109> these<00:04:12.260> sorts<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.590> positions<00:04:12.709> i

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
and I mean these sorts of positions i

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.050 
and I mean these sorts of positions i
think<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:13.370> fine<00:04:15.130> on<00:04:16.130> each<00:04:16.190> Geary's<00:04:16.789> lost

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.700 
was a particularly important game
because<00:06:53.659> you<00:06:53.690> put<00:06:53.930> us<00:06:53.990> have<00:06:54.110> so<00:06:54.349> much<00:06:54.470> on<00:06:54.650> the

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
because you put us have so much on the

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.950 
because you put us have so much on the
line<00:06:54.800> this<00:06:55.190> week<00:06:55.400> or<00:06:55.669> just<00:06:56.150> like<00:06:56.750> any<00:06:56.930> other

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
line this week or just like any other

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.399 
line this week or just like any other
game<00:06:57.879> yeah<00:06:58.879> I<00:06:58.909> think<00:06:59.030> all<00:06:59.960> the<00:07:00.110> games<00:07:00.289> are

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
game yeah I think all the games are

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.140 
game yeah I think all the games are
important<00:07:00.860> on<00:07:01.009> this<00:07:01.190> one<00:07:01.370> was<00:07:01.460> also<00:07:01.580> critical

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
important on this one was also critical

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.520 
important on this one was also critical
that<00:07:03.250> I<00:07:04.250> mean<00:07:05.120> I<00:07:05.240> think<00:07:05.270> in<00:07:05.690> general<00:07:05.840> the

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
that I mean I think in general the

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.129 
that I mean I think in general the
result<00:07:06.879> doesn't<00:07:07.879> depend<00:07:08.180> on<00:07:08.300> one<00:07:08.479> game<00:07:08.659> and

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
result doesn't depend on one game and

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.450 
result doesn't depend on one game and
the<00:07:09.259> final<00:07:09.500> result<00:07:09.740> doesn't<00:07:09.889> depend<00:07:10.159> on<00:07:10.280> one

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
the final result doesn't depend on one

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.909 
the final result doesn't depend on one
game<00:07:10.610> night<00:07:10.849> you<00:07:11.599> can<00:07:11.780> was<00:07:12.110> looking<00:07:12.469> instilled

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
game night you can was looking instilled

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.350 
game night you can was looking instilled
in<00:07:13.009> a<00:07:13.069> torso<00:07:13.639> some<00:07:14.479> big<00:07:14.690> deal<00:07:14.840> I<00:07:16.270> think<00:07:17.270> it

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
in a torso some big deal I think it

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.290 
in a torso some big deal I think it
would<00:07:17.599> appear<00:07:17.870> that<00:07:17.900> was<00:07:18.349> if<00:07:19.159> we<00:07:19.490> needed<00:07:19.940> to

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
would appear that was if we needed to

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.839 
would appear that was if we needed to
overcome<00:07:20.599> each<00:07:21.020> other<00:07:21.259> but<00:07:22.159> is<00:07:22.340> it<00:07:22.370> is<00:07:22.669> when

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
overcome each other but is it is when

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.189 
overcome each other but is it is when
you<00:07:22.969> have<00:07:23.180> to<00:07:23.240> just<00:07:23.629> really<00:07:23.889> doesn't<00:07:24.889> like<00:07:25.009> it

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
you have to just really doesn't like it
