00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.790
 funny the basket is even heavier 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.800
 as before that we went off, of course 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.580
 given a 1 1 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.259
 which is a heavy load you carry 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:40.180
 anyone does not call then all buttons 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:42.460
 I think this is a chef but 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.170
 at least that seems to be buzzing 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.039

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.070

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.800

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.140
 this bench you have time raise a 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 symbol compared to one 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.940

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.450

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.400

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.350
 Next time I read the leagues until now 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.350
 rash to incontinent to give it rain 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.520

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.020
 the constancy of your bi ba butzemann in 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.020
 around our house 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.140
 Now she's that one to really 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.140
 impressed 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.430
 Do you think so for a weight yes 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.100

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.200

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.170
 you alone come to me mine 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:48.230

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:50.600
 I have married the little garden 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.310
 I also have a lot of stones but they are 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.900
 much much more cute of those 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.480
 I want to make a stone away 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.610
 But I still have to buy some 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.200
 i need a stone expert well 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.200
 do you want to come with me 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.590
 you do not rest 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.920
 all stones and through them the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.920
 stones 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.590
 if all die up 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:41.050
 the stone is bigger than me there you have 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.050
 right but she was over there 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.640
 this is not the biggest one 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.170
 I'm yours around the world 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.800
 would you like to see something like this? 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.510
 the big stones are made small 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 I take care of this arrogant fatzke 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:01.960
 I was very excited about him later because he 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.280
 you should see stones crushed 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.300
 wondered how it would be if he did that 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.300
 should do it yourself 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:57.610
 I'm cool , here's one 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:06:01.150
 Family reunion for you is the hobby 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:10.360

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:13.419
 very new is the so much fun with opi 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.090
 gave that he wanted to thank him 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.849
 you can have the stones if I am 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.620
 Thank you very much 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.340
 I lay with the others in mine 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.340
 rockery 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.150
 This is a stone, of course 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:38.180
 yes no stones grow but it sees 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:41.300
 but pretty or perfect had there 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.889
 no great animation films his 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.889
 stone collection would do 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:58.340
 Oh, holy shit 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:59.720
 this little jokes and yes it will 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.370
 slow time for him one anyway 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.849
 maybe this is family 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.099
 the perfect opportunity 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:09.610
 Now think everything grows in one 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.610
