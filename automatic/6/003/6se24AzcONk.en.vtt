it's<00:00:32.320> Gooding<00:00:32.920> late<00:00:33.160> call<00:00:33.519> a<00:00:33.550> soft<00:00:34.030> call<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
it's Gooding late call a soft call and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.689 
it's Gooding late call a soft call and
do<00:00:34.690> anything<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.320> gobbler<00:00:35.739> or<00:00:35.890> hen<00:00:36.160> can<00:00:36.399> do<00:00:36.550> on

do anything a gobbler or hen can do on

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.700 
do anything a gobbler or hen can do on
this<00:00:36.910> call<00:00:37.590> gobbles

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
this call gobbles

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.799 
this call gobbles
yep's<00:00:39.340> it<00:00:39.640> doesn't<00:00:39.910> matter<00:00:40.059> you<00:00:40.480> can<00:00:40.510> do<00:00:40.660> it

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
yep's it doesn't matter you can do it

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.200 
yep's it doesn't matter you can do it
all<00:00:41.039> and<00:00:42.039> I<00:00:42.129> think<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.489> main<00:00:42.699> reason<00:00:42.730> that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
all and I think the main reason that

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.209 
all and I think the main reason that
it's<00:00:43.449> not<00:00:43.510> priced<00:00:44.019> popular<00:00:44.500> as<00:00:44.559> it<00:00:44.710> should<00:00:44.980> be

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
it's not priced popular as it should be

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.599 
it's not priced popular as it should be
or<00:00:45.460> could<00:00:45.670> be<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:47.019> because<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.559> is<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:48.550> coldest

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
or could be is because it is of coldest

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.549 
or could be is because it is of coldest
maybe<00:00:51.609> not<00:00:51.879> that<00:00:52.030> easy<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.539> master<00:00:52.780> but<00:00:53.199> but

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
maybe not that easy to master but but

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.410 
maybe not that easy to master but but
we'll<00:00:53.769> pretty<00:00:54.100> much<00:00:54.249> developed<00:00:54.609> a<00:00:54.879> patented

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
we'll pretty much developed a patented

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.819 
we'll pretty much developed a patented
pop<00:00:55.899> on<00:00:56.140> Reed

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829
