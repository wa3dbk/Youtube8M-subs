00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
goes to the back the gearbox so you can

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.220 
goes to the back the gearbox so you can
see<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.060> setup<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.900> we've<00:00:22.020> got<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
see in this setup here we've got a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.960 
see in this setup here we've got a

optical measuring device which measures
the<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:41.250> rotation<00:00:41.960> I'm<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.440> sure<00:00:43.620> how<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the the rotation I'm not sure how it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
the the rotation I'm not sure how it
communicates<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.640> Miss<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:44.969> RF<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.539> I'm

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
communicates I see Miss by RF but I'm

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.410 
communicates I see Miss by RF but I'm
not<00:00:45.780> sure<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:47.250> basically<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> working

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
not sure and basically this is a working

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
not sure and basically this is a working
one<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> four

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
one and you can see that it's got a four

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.020 
one and you can see that it's got a four
wire<00:00:52.649> interface<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.850> um

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
wire interface there because it's got um

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
wire interface there because it's got um
it<00:00:54.539> outputs<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.920> outputs<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> drive

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it outputs if I can it outputs the drive

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
it outputs if I can it outputs the drive
shaft<00:00:56.910> torque<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.579> drive<00:00:59.579> shaft<00:00:59.850> RPM<00:01:00.710> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
shaft torque and the drive shaft RPM and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.750 
shaft torque and the drive shaft RPM and
i'll<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.309> i<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.719> move<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.019> while

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
i'll see if i can move it here while

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.280 
i'll see if i can move it here while
well<00:01:05.760> i'm<00:01:05.850> holding<00:01:06.119> everything<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.170> i

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
well i'm holding everything so if i

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
well i'm holding everything so if i
leaned<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
leaned on it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.380 
leaned on it
you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.289> talk<00:01:10.909> talk<00:01:11.909> increases

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you can see the talk talk increases

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.520 
you can see the talk talk increases
their<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:12.630> I've<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> break<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.289> here

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
their so I've got a break about here

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
their so I've got a break about here
which<00:01:13.679> which<00:01:14.070> means<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.780> actually<00:01:15.780> would<00:01:15.899> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
which which means it actually would you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.219 
which which means it actually would you
be<00:01:16.079> able<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:17.090> put<00:01:18.090> some<00:01:18.329> lean<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.929> it<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> little

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
be able to put some lean on it a little

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.880 
be able to put some lean on it a little
bit

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.399 

thanks<00:01:22.550> very<00:01:22.729> much

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
thanks very much

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.380 
thanks very much
and<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.159> obviously<00:01:25.429> this<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:25.909> great<00:01:26.119> if<00:01:26.240> you're

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
and so obviously this is great if you're

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.649 
and so obviously this is great if you're
an<00:01:27.159> actual<00:01:28.159> car<00:01:28.609> set<00:01:28.850> up<00:01:28.969> because<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.569> means

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
an actual car set up because it means

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.450 
an actual car set up because it means
you<00:01:29.780> can<00:01:29.960> measure<00:01:30.109> how<00:01:30.499> much<00:01:30.950> torque<00:01:31.280> you're

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
you can measure how much torque you're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.410 
you can measure how much torque you're
getting<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.270> ground<00:01:32.479> before<00:01:34.420> before

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
getting to the ground before before

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.849 
getting to the ground before before
you're<00:01:35.689> losing<00:01:35.960> traction<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.649> can<00:01:36.770> measure

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
you're losing traction you can measure

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:37.749 
you're losing traction you can measure
how<00:01:37.039> much<00:01:37.130> saught<00:01:37.310> you're<00:01:37.429> getting<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
how much saught you're getting to the

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.770 
how much saught you're getting to the
ground<00:01:37.939> while<00:01:38.090> you're<00:01:38.270> losing<00:01:38.569> traction<00:01:39.399> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
ground while you're losing traction and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.300 
ground while you're losing traction and
you<00:01:41.780> can<00:01:41.959> actually<00:01:42.109> measure<00:01:42.829> how<00:01:42.950> much<00:01:43.069> talk

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
you can actually measure how much talk

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.959 
you can actually measure how much talk
you're<00:01:43.459> getting<00:01:43.640> under<00:01:43.789> real-world

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
you're getting under real-world

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.429 
you're getting under real-world
conditions<00:01:44.090> which<00:01:44.959> always<00:01:45.109> tend<00:01:45.319> to<00:01:45.380> be

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
conditions which always tend to be

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.899 
conditions which always tend to be
slightly<00:01:45.560> different<00:01:45.890> from<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.219> dyno<00:01:46.429> for<00:01:46.759> some

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
slightly different from a dyno for some

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
line as from looking at it the doughnut

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.090 
line as from looking at it the doughnut
is<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.400> tight<00:02:49.820> fit<00:02:49.850> onto<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.020> shaft<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
is a tight fit onto the shaft of the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.420 
is a tight fit onto the shaft of the
yoke<00:02:53.140> making<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.230> very<00:02:54.430> application-specific

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
yoke making it very application-specific

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.060 
yoke making it very application-specific
based<00:02:56.300> on<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.630> diameter<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> yoke<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:57.920> if

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
based on the diameter of the yoke so if

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.949 
based on the diameter of the yoke so if
you<00:02:58.430> get<00:02:58.580> different<00:02:58.790> diameters<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.450> yolks<00:02:59.780> we

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
you get different diameters of yolks we

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.510 
you get different diameters of yolks we
can<00:03:00.080> make<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> different<00:03:00.590> application<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:01.400> it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
can make a different application for it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520 
can make a different application for it
okay<00:03:02.240> so<00:03:02.300> does<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:02.690> mean<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.290> had<00:03:03.470> I

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
okay so does that mean that if I had I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.520 
okay so does that mean that if I had I
am<00:03:03.800> if<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.220> had<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.370> different<00:03:04.670> yoke<00:03:05.410> pretty<00:03:06.410> for

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
am if I had a different yoke pretty for

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.470 
am if I had a different yoke pretty for
a<00:03:06.560> car<00:03:06.770> like<00:03:06.980> same<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.430> rx7<00:03:08.060> or<00:03:08.150> something<00:03:08.390> like

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
a car like same as rx7 or something like

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.540 
a car like same as rx7 or something like
that<00:03:08.540> then<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.770> would<00:03:09.920> only<00:03:10.040> be<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.280> matter<00:03:10.400> of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
that then it would only be a matter of

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.960 
that then it would only be a matter of
adjusting<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.269> diameter<00:03:12.250> yes<00:03:13.250> if<00:03:13.550> we<00:03:13.760> if

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
adjusting for the diameter yes if we if

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.460 
adjusting for the diameter yes if we if
we<00:03:14.000> don't<00:03:14.330> have<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.690> parts<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.080> fit<00:03:15.230> that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
we don't have the parts that fit that

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.040 
we don't have the parts that fit that
damn<00:03:15.800> word<00:03:16.010> Rio<00:03:16.220> already<00:03:16.880> in<00:03:17.060> house<00:03:17.269> we<00:03:17.870> could

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
damn word Rio already in house we could

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.900 
damn word Rio already in house we could
do<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> special<00:03:18.709> one<00:03:19.010> for<00:03:19.040> your<00:03:19.459> yoke<00:03:19.700> and

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
do a special one for your yoke and

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.370 
do a special one for your yoke and
probably<00:03:20.209> turn<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.510> around<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.870> less<00:03:21.050> than<00:03:21.200> two

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
probably turn it around in less than two

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.670 
probably turn it around in less than two
weeks<00:03:21.970> awesome<00:03:22.970> okay<00:03:23.239> cool<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.470> I

they<00:03:53.950> can<00:03:54.100> cook<00:03:54.280> for<00:03:54.310> their<00:03:54.580> direct<00:03:54.850> line<00:03:55.030> but

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
they can cook for their direct line but

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.350 
they can cook for their direct line but
what<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> what<00:03:56.560> about<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:56.950> uses<00:03:57.910> for<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.240> in

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
what a what about on uses for it in

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.900 
what a what about on uses for it in
terms<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.780> like<00:03:59.080> chassis<00:03:59.380> setup<00:03:59.620> or<00:04:00.010> yeah

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
terms of like chassis setup or yeah

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.070 
terms of like chassis setup or yeah
engine<00:04:01.180> chaining<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.600> sort<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.810> thing<00:04:01.870> what

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
engine chaining that sort of thing what

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.020 
engine chaining that sort of thing what
other<00:04:02.200> side<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.440> uses<00:04:02.830> uses<00:04:03.040> for<00:04:03.460> this<00:04:03.580> we

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
other side of uses uses for this we

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.340 
other side of uses uses for this we
could<00:04:04.240> talk<00:04:04.420> for<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.720> rest<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.140> show<00:04:05.320> and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
could talk for the rest of the show and

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.020 
could talk for the rest of the show and
go<00:04:05.680> over<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:05.830> possible<00:04:06.370> uses<00:04:06.730> for<00:04:06.760> this

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
go over the possible uses for this

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.270 
go over the possible uses for this
obviously<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.050> an<00:04:08.170> on-vehicle<00:04:08.320> dynamometer

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
obviously it's an on-vehicle dynamometer

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.990 
obviously it's an on-vehicle dynamometer
so<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.790> gives<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.120> power<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.690> torque<00:04:12.000> the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
so it gives you power and torque the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.610 
so it gives you power and torque the
greatness<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.600> this<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:14.050> it<00:04:14.200> shows<00:04:14.440> you

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
greatness of this is it shows you

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.590 
greatness of this is it shows you
actually<00:04:15.190> how<00:04:15.460> much<00:04:15.790> power<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.390> torque

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
actually how much power and torque

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.050 
actually how much power and torque
you're<00:04:16.989> putting<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.590> ground<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.670> as

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
you're putting to the ground so as

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.699 
you're putting to the ground so as
typically<00:04:19.840> how<00:04:19.959> it's<00:04:20.110> been<00:04:20.200> done<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> past

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
typically how it's been done in the past

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.680 
typically how it's been done in the past
you<00:04:20.950> go<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.220> shop<00:04:21.520> use<00:04:21.880> their<00:04:22.090> dynamometer

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
you go to a shop use their dynamometer

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.980 
you go to a shop use their dynamometer
you<00:04:23.500> know<00:04:23.680> at<00:04:23.920> that<00:04:23.950> time<00:04:24.190> at<00:04:24.790> that<00:04:24.820> shop<00:04:25.420> your

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
you know at that time at that shop your

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.470 
you know at that time at that shop your
engine<00:04:26.290> made<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.620> much<00:04:26.860> power<00:04:27.190> however<00:04:28.120> what

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
engine made this much power however what

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.330 
engine made this much power however what
that<00:04:28.660> doesn't<00:04:29.020> take<00:04:29.170> into<00:04:29.470> effect<00:04:29.980> is<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
that doesn't take into effect is the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.950 
that doesn't take into effect is the
weather<00:04:30.520> conditions<00:04:30.730> at<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.360> track<00:04:31.630> or<00:04:31.930> the

the torque that's being delivered maybe

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.880 
the torque that's being delivered maybe
you<00:04:46.270> are<00:04:46.360> considering<00:04:46.810> a<00:04:46.960> tire<00:04:47.230> change<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.830> a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
you are considering a tire change to a

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.160 
you are considering a tire change to a
new<00:04:47.950> tire<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.820> compare<00:04:49.240> laps<00:04:49.480> before<00:04:49.780> and

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
new tire you compare laps before and

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.600 
new tire you compare laps before and
after<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.530> say<00:04:50.680> hey<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:50.920> know<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.340> torques

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
after you say hey you know the torques

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.920 
after you say hey you know the torques
down<00:04:51.820> maybe<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.300> should<00:04:52.480> have<00:04:52.540> went<00:04:52.660> with<00:04:52.750> the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
down maybe you should have went with the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.410 
down maybe you should have went with the
other<00:04:53.080> tires<00:04:53.520> your<00:04:54.520> weather<00:04:54.730> conditions<00:04:55.300> are

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
other tires your weather conditions are

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.910 
other tires your weather conditions are
cooler<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:55.870> say<00:04:56.020> hey<00:04:56.170> last<00:04:56.440> time<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.710> was

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
cooler you say hey last time I was

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.620 
cooler you say hey last time I was
making<00:04:57.310> more<00:04:57.460> torque<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.940> turn<00:04:58.060> three<00:04:58.480> you

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
making more torque and turn three you

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.660 
making more torque and turn three you
come<00:04:58.840> go<00:04:59.410> back<00:04:59.590> look<00:04:59.890> through<00:05:00.070> your<00:05:00.130> logs<00:05:00.400> make

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
come go back look through your logs make

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.220 
come go back look through your logs make
a<00:05:00.700> fuel<00:05:01.120> adjustment<00:05:01.240> which<00:05:01.870> brings<00:05:02.140> your

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
a fuel adjustment which brings your

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.860 
a fuel adjustment which brings your
torque<00:05:02.500> back<00:05:02.680> up<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:03.040> where<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.280> needs<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.610> be

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
torque back up to where it needs to be

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.540 
torque back up to where it needs to be
yeah<00:05:04.870> I'm<00:05:05.200> one<00:05:05.500> problem<00:05:05.710> I've<00:05:05.830> got<00:05:05.890> is<00:05:06.070> with<00:05:06.340> my

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
yeah I'm one problem I've got is with my

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.690 
yeah I'm one problem I've got is with my
own<00:05:06.700> with<00:05:07.600> my<00:05:07.780> diff<00:05:08.380> but<00:05:08.800> with<00:05:09.070> my<00:05:09.220> suspension

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
own with my diff but with my suspension

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.460 
own with my diff but with my suspension
setup<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.090> if<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.390> think<00:05:10.630> I'm<00:05:11.350> actually

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
setup and if I think I'm actually

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.560 
setup and if I think I'm actually
lifting<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:11.980> inside<00:05:12.250> wheel<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.730> one<00:05:13.390> of<00:05:13.480> the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
lifting the inside wheel on one of the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.190 
lifting the inside wheel on one of the
corners<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:14.790> yeah<00:05:15.790> yeah<00:05:16.090> if<00:05:16.450> your<00:05:16.660> if<00:05:16.810> your

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
corners and yeah yeah if your if your

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.720 
corners and yeah yeah if your if your
wheels<00:05:17.590> are<00:05:17.800> coming<00:05:17.830> off<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.310> ground<00:05:18.550> they're

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
wheels are coming off the ground they're

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.550 
wheels are coming off the ground they're
not<00:05:18.880> putting<00:05:19.090> Jordan<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.810> edge<00:05:20.230> of<00:05:20.470> the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
not putting Jordan to the edge of the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.160 
not putting Jordan to the edge of the
pavement<00:05:20.770> well<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.490> going<00:05:21.880> forward<00:05:22.450> it's

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
pavement well it going forward it's

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.080 
pavement well it going forward it's
supposed<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.500> be<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.650> locking<00:05:24.040> diff<00:05:24.220> that<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.550> get

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
supposed to be a locking diff that I get

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.550 
supposed to be a locking diff that I get
the<00:05:25.180> impression<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.630> when<00:05:26.170> one<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.410> wheels

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
the impression that when one the wheels

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.990 
the impression that when one the wheels
if<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.950> doesn't<00:05:27.190> actually<00:05:27.250> like<00:05:27.550> properly<00:05:27.850> or

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
if it doesn't actually like properly or

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.820 
if it doesn't actually like properly or
something<00:05:28.240> like<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:28.420> say<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:29.560> could<00:05:29.800> very

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
something like that say that could very

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.190 
something like that say that could very
well<00:05:30.100> be<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:31.120> know<00:05:31.330> yeah<00:05:31.870> if<00:05:31.960> you're<00:05:32.110> not

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
well be you know yeah if you're not

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.050 
well be you know yeah if you're not
getting<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.620> force<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.490> ground<00:05:33.850> you're

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
getting the force to the ground you're

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.180 
getting the force to the ground you're
going<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.240> see<00:05:34.390> a<00:05:34.420> decrease<00:05:34.810> in<00:05:34.960> torque<00:05:35.410> where

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
going to see a decrease in torque where

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.850 
going to see a decrease in torque where
you<00:05:36.340> would<00:05:36.430> be<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:36.670> that<00:05:36.820> curve<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.860> that

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
you would be in that curve and that

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.810 
you would be in that curve and that
could<00:05:39.040> tell<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:39.370> need<00:05:39.490> to<00:05:39.580> make<00:05:39.700> an

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
could tell you need to make an

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.130 
could tell you need to make an
adjustment<00:05:39.880> or<00:05:40.360> maybe<00:05:40.540> your<00:05:40.720> parts<00:05:40.990> not

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
adjustment or maybe your parts not

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.740 
adjustment or maybe your parts not
performing<00:05:41.710> or<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.010> broke<00:05:42.460> even<00:05:43.270> maybe<00:05:43.450> you've

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
performing or is broke even maybe you've

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.860 
performing or is broke even maybe you've
you<00:05:44.290> been<00:05:44.320> using<00:05:44.590> something<00:05:44.950> for<00:05:45.250> a<00:05:45.280> few<00:05:45.520> see

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
you been using something for a few see

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.990 
you been using something for a few see
then<00:05:46.110> it's<00:05:46.500> run<00:05:46.710> its<00:05:46.740> life<00:05:47.070> you're<00:05:47.310> hard<00:05:47.550> racer

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
then it's run its life you're hard racer

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.180 
then it's run its life you're hard racer
you<00:05:48.120> push<00:05:48.330> things<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.840> edge<00:05:49.110> did<00:05:49.770> lack<00:05:49.980> of

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
you push things to the edge did lack of

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.590 
you push things to the edge did lack of
torque<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.610> can<00:05:50.730> look<00:05:50.910> back<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:51.090> say<00:05:51.360> why<00:05:51.510> is

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
torque you can look back and say why is

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.510 
torque you can look back and say why is
my<00:05:51.960> performance<00:05:52.560> not<00:05:52.740> there<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.160> can<00:05:53.280> go<00:05:53.370> back

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
my performance not there you can go back

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.340 
my performance not there you can go back
and<00:05:53.580> say<00:05:53.760> hey<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:54.300> part<00:05:54.630> is<00:05:54.780> failing<00:05:55.020> me<00:05:55.170> it's

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
and say hey this part is failing me it's

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.080 
and say hey this part is failing me it's
time<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.710> replace<00:05:56.070> this<00:05:56.310> or<00:05:56.490> do<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.640> maintenance

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
time to replace this or do a maintenance

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.390 
time to replace this or do a maintenance
or<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.270> service<00:05:57.510> on<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:57.990> as<00:05:58.080> well<00:05:58.260> well<00:05:59.190> somehow

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
or a service on it as well well somehow

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.490 
or a service on it as well well somehow
thanks<00:06:00.090> very<00:06:00.240> much<00:06:00.270> very<00:06:00.390> good<00:06:00.950> find<00:06:01.950> joy<00:06:02.190> show
