00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 understood more from him 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.510
 at the moment we're going to show the logic 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.660
 Clearly the sealed box with no 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.840

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 2002 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.770
 thirteen years later I can come here and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.400
 To open it is to take the envelope and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 case was given only capanema and canada until 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.170
 here behind right 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.600
 and here it is only official product 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm going to open one here for you. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.729
 rip have already my method alone 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.070
 here is that galera 11 that is good for us 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.200
 very well letting the ball pass to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 the staff is very light even if there is no 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 rips in front there what happens you have 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:53.579
 chance to store an envelope without 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.890
 damage the cards or any other 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.170
 envelope to keep the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.409
 to do sometimes I'm kind of like this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.570
 In this case in 2002 it is worth seeing if 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.149
 I can watch the videos this time. 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.759

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.940

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.600
