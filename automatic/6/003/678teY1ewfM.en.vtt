00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
get this looseness there is a really of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.160 
get this looseness there is a really of
control<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> water<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.750> three

how to do that i'll show you how to work
with<00:01:56.040> salt<00:01:56.360> salt<00:01:57.619> it's<00:01:58.619> when<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.400> lose<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
with salt salt it's when you lose the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.730 
with salt salt it's when you lose the
sheen<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.720> you're<00:02:00.840> able<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.500> the

sheen is when you're able to get the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
sheen is when you're able to get the
texture<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> crystals<00:02:03.180> which<00:02:03.540> gives<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
texture and the crystals which gives you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.429 
texture and the crystals which gives you
the<00:02:04.229> texture<00:02:04.820> also<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.119> painting<00:02:06.689> white<00:02:06.960> parts

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the texture also in painting white parts

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.360 
the texture also in painting white parts
to<00:02:08.009> learn<00:02:08.280> how<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> paint<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.450> without<00:02:10.440> making

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to learn how to paint it without making

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.990 
to learn how to paint it without making
it<00:02:11.640> look<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> whole<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.020> looks<00:02:13.350> like

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
it look like a whole but it looks like

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.600 
it look like a whole but it looks like
it's<00:02:15.000> white<00:02:15.360> hot<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.410> there's<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.739> lot<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.370> learn

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's white hot so there's a lot to learn

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.490 
it's white hot so there's a lot to learn
in<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.660> watercolor<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
in just this of this one watercolor you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.070 
in just this of this one watercolor you
can<00:02:22.739> learn<00:02:23.310> about<00:02:24.470> painting<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.040> negatives

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
can learn about painting the negatives

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.620 
can learn about painting the negatives
so<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:29.069> are<00:02:29.400> introducing<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.269> for<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> first

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
so we are introducing this for the first
