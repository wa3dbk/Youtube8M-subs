00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi everyone so today the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.710
 good daily for my second video 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.380
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.710
 put cinema the case of the herbs 14 in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.570
 France and so that's nice 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.570
 already we start at the cinema cadets 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.110
 2 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.609
 I do for his daughter alone 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.159
 so here we are then see a site in 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.109
 English what to do while 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.750
 just in fact it's going to go into the 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.750
 you do check for updates 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.660
 but we have to wait it's not very very 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 long 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.920
 so here's once it happened here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
 in an optional 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 you see that his writings and rich 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.250
 documentation update then at the top 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.440
 ticked all done installs 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.150
 it's often 50th but I think if 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.830
 we have a pretty fast connection should 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.350
 take 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.920
 barely ten minutes just two minutes 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.159
 2 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.150
 so here we go 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.360
 always 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.360
 it's her 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.640
 2 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 high tech 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.750
 tuning installation 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.290
 low altitude and space 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.220
 so there you have to restart cinema cannes 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.220
 and hockey 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.520
 we restart 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.330
 oh yes it's maybe 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.330
 and also very fast I think 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.770
 ah the tug trackers 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.630
 so that's it then it'll start 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.700
 you still have not done in French 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 so you have to go back to shovel 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 once check for updates 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.070
 and there you will have all that then 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.750
 so here you are just looking for 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.069
 french language bac so there for that 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.370
 layers and 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.500
 konÃ© up 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.780
 French simply has it if you 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.569
 want small country I'm no longer really 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.970
 what's the point so we're going to drop them this 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.660
 evening it's a stage where what is fast 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.130
 tac and that's so it's sad laughed 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.660
 Yes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.600
 does it start 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430
 it's a staff and then the country 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.530
 settles 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.670
 the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.670
 and that's it restart 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.380
 and here you can see that everything is 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.620
 in french character my pass culture 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.239
 made it so my hosts were there when 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.410
 to see it is in French then 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.209
 maybe you can have a 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.910
 problem maybe dedicating him I know 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.780
 not if possible but no less could 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.860
 go to publishing site where you not in 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.920
 all kinds in French can go in 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.920
 preferring general edition I believe 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.150
 yeah that too quietly 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.980
 aulas he 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.620
 so there in Switzerland he hires will be 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.110
 maybe on English which you can m 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.819
 if you simply tick French and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.099
 so then you close and it's okay 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.030
 put a French so thank you for having 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.810
