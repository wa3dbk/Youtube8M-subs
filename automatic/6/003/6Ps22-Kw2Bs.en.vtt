00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
kindle fire which would be really really

cool<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> good<00:01:28.500> step<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
cool I think it's a good step in the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120 
cool I think it's a good step in the
right<00:01:29.490> direction<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.299> nokia<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.920> leak

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
right direction for nokia and the leak

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
right direction for nokia and the leak
seems<00:01:32.369> pretty<00:01:33.119> believable<00:01:33.420> since<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> doesn't

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
seems pretty believable since it doesn't

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
seems pretty believable since it doesn't
have<00:01:34.560> any<00:01:34.740> windows<00:01:34.890> button<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.850> it's
