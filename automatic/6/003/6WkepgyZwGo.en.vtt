00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
this being the very first thing that's

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.960

ground level first and second floors I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.649 
ground level first and second floors I
think<00:01:18.490> when<00:01:18.609> we<00:01:18.759> thought<00:01:19.030> about<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.359> one<00:01:19.630> of

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
think when we thought about it one of

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.300 
think when we thought about it one of
the<00:01:19.780> first<00:01:19.960> meetings<00:01:20.109> we<00:01:20.439> had<00:01:20.590> with<00:01:20.619> honors<00:01:21.100> we

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the first meetings we had with honors we

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.779 
the first meetings we had with honors we
focused<00:01:21.729> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.200> common<00:01:23.560> areas<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.249> the

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
focused on the common areas and the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.870 
focused on the common areas and the
study<00:01:25.030> lounges<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:27.219> overall<00:01:27.640> atmosphere

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
study lounges and the overall atmosphere

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.349 
study lounges and the overall atmosphere
I<00:01:28.570> think<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.979> study<00:01:30.579> lounges<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.240> we

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
I think that the study lounges that we

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.359 
I think that the study lounges that we
created<00:01:31.749> both<00:01:32.079> in<00:01:32.259> terms<00:01:32.469> of<00:01:32.619> their<00:01:32.770> location

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
created both in terms of their location

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.429 
created both in terms of their location
that<00:01:33.609> size<00:01:33.880> are<00:01:34.719> gonna<00:01:34.929> really<00:01:35.109> lend

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
that size are gonna really lend

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.929 
that size are gonna really lend
themselves<00:01:35.530> well<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.100> things<00:01:36.549> like<00:01:36.640> group

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
themselves well to things like group

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.010 
themselves well to things like group
study<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.409> quiet<00:01:39.340> study<00:01:39.609> as<00:01:39.880> well<00:01:40.119> which<00:01:40.869> is

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
study and quiet study as well which is

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.899 
study and quiet study as well which is
important<00:01:41.469> for<00:01:42.189> all<00:01:42.310> students<00:01:42.759> but

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
important for all students but

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.370 
important for all students but
especially<00:01:43.090> for<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.569> honor<00:01:43.719> students<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
especially for the honor students and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.129 
especially for the honor students and
then<00:01:44.890> we<00:01:45.069> have<00:01:45.280> these<00:01:45.490> larger<00:01:46.179> places<00:01:46.719> like

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
then we have these larger places like

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.919 
then we have these larger places like
this<00:01:47.350> Great<00:01:47.649> Hall<00:01:47.889> and<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:49.060> fireplace<00:01:49.719> lounge

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
this Great Hall and the fireplace lounge

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.109 
this Great Hall and the fireplace lounge
we'll<00:01:50.289> call<00:01:50.469> it<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.710> third<00:01:51.009> floor<00:01:51.340> where

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
we'll call it on the third floor where

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.980 
we'll call it on the third floor where
you<00:01:52.149> might<00:01:52.689> find<00:01:52.929> a<00:01:53.109> faculty<00:01:53.319> member

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
you might find a faculty member

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.899 
you might find a faculty member
or<00:01:54.130> Chancellor<00:01:55.130> or<00:01:55.250> someone<00:01:55.549> who's<00:01:55.700> going<00:01:55.820> to

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
or Chancellor or someone who's going to

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.090 
or Chancellor or someone who's going to
come<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.450> visit<00:01:56.570> with<00:01:56.780> students<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.470> have

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
come in and visit with students and have

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.600 
come in and visit with students and have
you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.210> smaller<00:02:00.189> intimate<00:02:01.189> setting

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
you know it's a smaller intimate setting

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.910 
you know it's a smaller intimate setting
for<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.909> program<00:02:02.360> versus<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.290> blue<00:02:03.530> or<00:02:03.799> an

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
for a program versus the blue or an

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.830 
for a program versus the blue or an
auditorium<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.330> right<00:02:05.479> here<00:02:05.509> where

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
auditorium and it's right here where

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.420 
auditorium and it's right here where
they<00:02:05.960> live<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.830> think<00:02:06.920> that'll<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.340> very

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
they live so I think that'll be very

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.569 
they live so I think that'll be very
appealing<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.179> students
