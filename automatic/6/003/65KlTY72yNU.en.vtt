00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
take it out once it's gone we're going
to<00:01:06.420> start<00:01:06.750> placing<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.440> bands<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.039> start

to start placing your bands and start
the<00:01:08.700> hooking<00:01:09.090> process<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.500> we're<00:01:10.679> going<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the hooking process so we're going to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.339 
the hooking process so we're going to
take<00:01:11.250> any<00:01:11.580> color<00:01:12.000> band<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.690> we're<00:01:12.899> going<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:13.349 
take any color band and we're going to

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:19.490 
take any color band and we're going to
place<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.700> peg<00:01:15.950> like<00:01:16.950> an<00:01:17.959> eighth<00:01:18.959> time

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
place on one peg like an eighth time

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.760 
place on one peg like an eighth time
this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.819> it<00:01:21.119> should<00:01:21.149> look<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.929> an

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this is the way it should look like an

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
this is the way it should look like an
infinity<00:01:23.459> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> an<00:01:24.240> eighth<00:01:24.509> sign<00:01:24.810> I'm

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
infinity kind of an eighth sign I'm

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.680 
infinity kind of an eighth sign I'm
going<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.069> process<00:01:26.509> repeatedly<00:01:27.509> on

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
going to do this process repeatedly on

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.760 
going to do this process repeatedly on
these<00:01:28.050> pegs<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.410> it<00:01:31.470> should

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
these pegs so this is how now it should

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.570 
these pegs so this is how now it should
look<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.989> bunch<00:01:33.989> of<00:01:34.200> eights<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.280> pegs

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
look like a bunch of eights on your pegs

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.840 
look like a bunch of eights on your pegs
like<00:01:35.849> this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.210 

ok<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.080> we're<00:01:42.320> going<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.530> start<00:01:42.890> placing

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
ok so now we're going to start placing

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.090 
ok so now we're going to start placing
our<00:01:43.670> other<00:01:43.940> color<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.600> we<00:01:45.320> don't<00:01:45.530> have<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.950> do

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
our other color and we don't have to do

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.750 
our other color and we don't have to do
H<00:01:46.370> for<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.350> for<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.560> we're<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.550> going<00:01:49.729> to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
H for this for this we're just going to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.670 
H for this for this we're just going to
have<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.120> place<00:01:50.360> them<00:01:50.540> normally<00:01:51.140> like<00:01:51.470> you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
have to place them normally like you

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.280 
have to place them normally like you
would<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:53.120> is<00:01:53.300> our<00:01:53.479> second<00:01:53.930> layer<00:01:54.080> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
would so this is our second layer of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.380 
would so this is our second layer of
bands<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.860> as<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.550> can<00:01:55.729> see<00:01:55.970> I've<00:01:56.060> placed

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
bands and as you can see I've placed

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.630 
bands and as you can see I've placed
them<00:01:56.690> normally<00:01:57.400> like<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:59.890> not<00:02:00.890> into<00:02:01.369> eighths

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
them normally like this not into eighths

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.260 
them normally like this not into eighths
but<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.330> normally<00:02:03.320> ok<00:02:03.590> guys<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.880> we're<00:02:05.119> going

going<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.000> start<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.570> hooking<00:02:08.929> process<00:02:09.440> so

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
going to start the hooking process so

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.030 
going to start the hooking process so
here<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.180> our<00:02:11.360> second<00:02:11.870> layer<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.110> bands<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.580 
two bands so we're going to get these
and<00:02:32.209> place<00:02:32.540> them<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.290> see

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.860 
going to repeat the process I just
showed<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:07.380> until<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.680> want<00:04:09.010> your<00:04:09.970> until<00:04:10.660> how

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
showed you until you want your until how

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.660

long you want your grip I just did it

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.660 
long you want your grip I just did it
like<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:12.880> small<00:04:13.450> type<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.650> grip<00:04:15.160> because<00:04:15.640> I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
like a small type of grip because I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.390 
like a small type of grip because I
really<00:04:16.389> didn't<00:04:16.630> want<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.620> do<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.829> long<00:04:18.100> one

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
really didn't want to do a long one

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.430 
really didn't want to do a long one
because<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.820> was<00:04:18.970> just<00:04:19.239> like<00:04:19.419> not<00:04:19.690> worth<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.200> I

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
because it was just like not worth it I

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.540
