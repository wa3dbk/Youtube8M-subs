00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
interested about as well Pete I did do a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
interested about as well Pete I did do a
little<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> research<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.390> all

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
little bit of research I think of all

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
little bit of research I think of all
the<00:00:40.020> Thursday<00:00:40.469> preseason<00:00:41.010> games<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.520> think

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the Thursday preseason games I think

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.979 
the Thursday preseason games I think
this<00:00:41.820> one's<00:00:42.059> probably<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> ones<00:00:42.840> I'm

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this one's probably one of the ones I'm

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
this one's probably one of the ones I'm
more<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.530> more<00:00:43.739> intrigued<00:00:44.190> by<00:00:44.370> than<00:00:44.610> any<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
more I'm more intrigued by than any of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.069 
more I'm more intrigued by than any of
the<00:00:45.000> other<00:00:45.120> ones<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> simple<00:00:46.050> fact

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the other ones just for the simple fact

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
the other ones just for the simple fact
that<00:00:46.350> I've<00:00:46.500> been<00:00:46.530> reading<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.039> bit

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that I've been reading a little bit

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.400 
that I've been reading a little bit
about<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.570> these<00:00:48.719> practice<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
about what they what these practice is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
about what they what these practice is
that<00:00:49.440> against<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.280> another<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.700> been

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that against one another have been

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.979 
that against one another have been
looking<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> looks<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.719> both<00:00:51.960> teams

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
looking like it looks like both teams

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
looking like it looks like both teams
have<00:00:52.440> come<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.800> according<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> couple<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have come out according to a couple of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
have come out according to a couple of
reports<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.410> feeling<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:55.949> about

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
reports that feeling pretty good about

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
reports that feeling pretty good about
that<00:00:56.250> where<00:00:56.610> they're<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:56.969> practicing<00:00:57.629> against

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that where they're at practicing against

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
that where they're at practicing against
different<00:00:58.230> defenses<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> skins

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
different defenses I think the skins

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490 
different defenses I think the skins
obviously<00:00:59.910> wanted<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> look<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.899> Jay

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
obviously wanted to get a look at Jay

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.130 
obviously wanted to get a look at Jay
Gruden's<00:01:01.920> new<00:01:02.129> offense<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.789> town<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.960> think

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
Gruden's new offense in town and I think

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.240 
Gruden's new offense in town and I think
that's<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> reasons<00:01:04.860> why<00:01:05.070> you're

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that's one of the reasons why you're

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.560 
that's one of the reasons why you're
running<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.000> bit<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.360> higher

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
running into a little bit of a higher

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.670 
running into a little bit of a higher
total<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.799> skins<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.180> signs<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
total here of the skins all signs out of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.870 
total here of the skins all signs out of
them<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.890> reported<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.610> looking

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
them have reported that they are looking

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
them have reported that they are looking
pretty<00:01:12.060> good<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.570> season<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.049> could<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
pretty good this season it could be a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
pretty good this season it could be a
huge<00:01:14.400> offensive<00:01:15.240> turnaround<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:15.990> them<00:01:16.200> if

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
huge offensive turnaround for them if

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.749 
huge offensive turnaround for them if
all<00:01:16.470> goes<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.130> everybody<00:01:17.340> stays

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
all goes well and everybody stays

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.070 
all goes well and everybody stays
healthy<00:01:17.970> online<00:01:18.299> team<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> obviously<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
healthy online team and obviously the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
healthy online team and obviously the
Patriots<00:01:19.560> even<00:01:20.189> though<00:01:20.280> they're<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
Patriots even though they're one of the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.219 
Patriots even though they're one of the
biggest<00:01:20.970> Super<00:01:21.479> Bowl<00:01:21.630> favorites<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
biggest Super Bowl favorites this

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.690 
biggest Super Bowl favorites this
offseason<00:01:22.770> they've<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.520> flown

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
offseason they've really have flown

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
offseason they've really have flown
under<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.299> radar<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.680> that's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
under the radar and I think that's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
under the radar and I think that's
really<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.310> their<00:01:26.430> liking<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.180> that

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
really to their liking and I think that

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.460 
really to their liking and I think that
they've<00:01:27.450> been<00:01:27.600> hearing<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> things

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
they've been hearing some of the things

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.719 
they've been hearing some of the things
some<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.829> predictions<00:01:29.130> has<00:01:29.430> been<00:01:29.579> made

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
some of the predictions has been made

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
some of the predictions has been made
about<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:30.150> after<00:01:30.270> Tom<00:01:30.689> Brady's<00:01:31.020> pretty<00:01:31.259> poor

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
about them after Tom Brady's pretty poor

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.109 
about them after Tom Brady's pretty poor
season<00:01:31.710> last<00:01:32.070> year<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.030> ready

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
season last year I think they're ready

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700 
season last year I think they're ready
to<00:01:33.270> turn<00:01:33.360> things<00:01:33.689> around<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.229> well<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.590> both

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to turn things around as well on both

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
to turn things around as well on both
sides<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> football<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
sides the football as we know that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
sides the football as we know that
defense<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.530> stacked<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.159> year

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
defense is going to be stacked this year

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
defense is going to be stacked this year
so<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.360> surprised<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.950> lot

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so don't be surprised if you see a lot

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
so don't be surprised if you see a lot
of<00:01:41.280> scoring<00:01:41.820> early<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.630> game<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
of scoring early on in this game and I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
of scoring early on in this game and I
wouldn't<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.920> wouldn't<00:01:44.009> surprise<00:01:44.369> me<00:01:44.549> see

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
wouldn't I wouldn't surprise me see

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.920 
wouldn't I wouldn't surprise me see
these<00:01:44.970> two<00:01:45.119> teams<00:01:45.360> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
these two teams kind of go back and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
these two teams kind of go back and
forth<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.439> trade<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> lead<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.460> yeah

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
forth and trade the lead all right yeah

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
forth and trade the lead all right yeah
I<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> might<00:01:48.240> stay<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> game<00:01:49.170> as

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
I think I might stay off this game as

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.929 
I think I might stay off this game as
far<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> pic<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> concerned<00:01:50.430> my<00:01:50.549> lien<00:01:50.759> would

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
far as a pic is concerned my lien would

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.580 
far as a pic is concerned my lien would
be<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> pats<00:01:51.420> plus<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.200> half<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
be the pats plus one and a half so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.749 
be the pats plus one and a half so
what's<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.860> official<00:01:52.920> pick<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.430> Jordan

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
what's your official pick here Jordan

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.670 
what's your official pick here Jordan
yeah<00:01:54.149> my<00:01:54.329> pics<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> Patriots<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.439> well<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
yeah my pics on the Patriots as well I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.109 
yeah my pics on the Patriots as well I
think<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> money<00:01:56.250> line<00:01:56.460> values<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> little

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
think that money line values a little

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
think that money line values a little
bit<00:01:57.240> too<00:01:57.390> much<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.750> overcome<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
bit too much to overcome and and with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.100 
bit too much to overcome and and with
the<00:01:59.040> Patriots<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.640> +<00:01:59.850> 105<00:02:00.180> where<00:02:00.659> most<00:02:00.869> books

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the Patriots at + 105 where most books

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.569 
the Patriots at + 105 where most books
are<00:02:01.259> giving<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.369> just

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
are giving it to you right now I just

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
are giving it to you right now I just
feel<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.060> even<00:02:03.210> though<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> Redskins<00:02:04.049> are

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
a horrendous season last year

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.809 
a horrendous season last year

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
but first year head coaches don't really

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.460 
but first year head coaches don't really
fair<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.180> well<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.080> preseason

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
fair that well in the preseason

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.789 
especially in week one of the preseason
they<00:02:18.420> were<00:02:18.480> only<00:02:18.629> two<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.019> four<00:02:19.319> straight<00:02:19.650> up
