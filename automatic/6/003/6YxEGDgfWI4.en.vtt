00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
and now we have other 16 pieces cut and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.790 
and now we have other 16 pieces cut and
work<00:01:41.090> what<00:01:41.390> we're<00:01:41.540> gonna<00:01:41.720> do<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.230> turn<00:01:42.590> them

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
work what we're gonna do is turn them

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.640 
work what we're gonna do is turn them
into<00:01:42.950> little<00:01:43.370> loops<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.290> do<00:01:45.440> that<00:01:47.440> we<00:01:48.440> take

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
into little loops and to do that we take

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.680 
into little loops and to do that we take
your<00:01:48.800> hot<00:01:49.010> glue<00:01:49.040> gun<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.790> put<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.300> little<00:01:50.570> dab

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
your hot glue gun you put a little dab

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.730 
your hot glue gun you put a little dab
on<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.110> edge<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:53.210> then<00:01:53.330> simply<00:01:53.840> fold<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.590> over

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
on the edge and then simply fold it over

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.820 
on the edge and then simply fold it over
and<00:01:55.160> stick<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.270> down<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:57.740> makes<00:01:57.950> Italy

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
and stick it down it just makes Italy

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.080 
and stick it down it just makes Italy
we're<00:02:00.830> going<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.160> be<00:02:01.250> doing<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.670> each

our loops made we're going to take our

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.609 
our loops made we're going to take our
base<00:02:06.860> piece<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.840> we're<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.320> start

base piece and we're going to start

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.690 
base piece and we're going to start
gluing<00:02:10.340> every<00:02:11.000> booth<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.200> base<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
gluing every booth to the base and the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.460 
gluing every booth to the base and the
way<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.030> what<00:02:14.150> you're<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:14.870> if

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
way and what you're going to do this if

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.350 
way and what you're going to do this if
every<00:02:15.890> time<00:02:16.040> these<00:02:16.190> glue<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.940> loops<00:02:17.150> on

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
every time these glue and loops on

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.540 
every time these glue and loops on
you're<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.560> glue<00:02:18.770> one<00:02:18.950> directly<00:02:19.340> across

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
you're going to glue one directly across

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.510 
you're going to glue one directly across
from<00:02:19.670> it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.250 

all<00:02:27.520> right<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.270> first<00:02:28.450> day<00:02:28.720> futon

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
all right so we have the first day futon

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.940 
all right so we have the first day futon
and<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.930> were<00:02:32.050> going<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.500> making<00:02:32.860> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and if we were going to be making a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.980 
and if we were going to be making a
smaller<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:33.520> do<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.760> stop<00:02:34.240> there<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.810> then

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
smaller one do that stop there and then

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.950 
smaller one do that stop there and then
begin<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.500> second<00:02:35.950> row<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:37.600> because

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
begin on the second row but because

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.360 
begin on the second row but because
we're<00:02:38.170> doing<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.620> bigger<00:02:38.830> one

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
we're doing a bigger one

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.600 
we're doing a bigger one
we<00:02:39.670> haven't<00:02:40.030> another<00:02:40.510> rows<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:41.170> these<00:02:41.610> three

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
we haven't another rows of these three

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.700 
we haven't another rows of these three
inch<00:02:42.790> pieces<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.510> go<00:02:43.630> around<00:02:43.960> you'd<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
inch pieces to go around you'd like to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.200 
inch pieces to go around you'd like to
make<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.860> smaller<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.460> can<00:02:45.700> stop<00:02:45.970> there

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
make the smaller one you can stop there

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.870 
make the smaller one you can stop there
and<00:02:46.660> wait<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.140> next<00:02:47.440> step<00:02:47.620> or<00:02:47.920> if<00:02:48.580> you're

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and wait for the next step or if you're

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.250 
and wait for the next step or if you're
making<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.330> larger<00:02:49.630> one<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.080> just

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
making the larger one you can just

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:04.160 
making the larger one you can just
continue<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.710> with<00:02:50.830> me<00:02:51.130> with<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:52.030> step

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.980 

if<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.320> like<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.710> can<00:03:05.770> even<00:03:06.040> stop<00:03:06.430> there<00:03:06.990> but

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
if you like you can even stop there but

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.680 
if you like you can even stop there but
I<00:03:08.290> think<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.770> looks<00:03:08.980> better<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.760> put<00:03:09.970> one

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
I think it looks better if you put one

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.220 
I think it looks better if you put one
go<00:03:10.990> after<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> long<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:13.630> we're<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.960> to<00:03:14.080> move

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
go after a long so we're going to move

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.340 
go after a long so we're going to move
on<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.650> next<00:03:14.860> step<00:03:15.720> I'm<00:03:16.720> going<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.110> switch

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
on to the next step I'm going to switch

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.340 
on to the next step I'm going to switch
to<00:03:17.380> my<00:03:17.910> cream-colored<00:03:18.910> piece<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.930> for<00:03:20.110> step

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
to my cream-colored piece and for step

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.260 
to my cream-colored piece and for step
two<00:03:20.560> what<00:03:21.220> you're<00:03:21.340> going<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.580> need<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.910> do<00:03:22.030> is

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
two what you're going to need to do is

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.310 
two what you're going to need to do is
cut<00:03:22.540> out<00:03:22.660> eight<00:03:22.930> pieces<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:24.610> are<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.930> inches

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
cut out eight pieces that are two inches

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.820 
cut out eight pieces that are two inches
long

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
long

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.950 
long
alrighty<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.640> have<00:03:27.790> all<00:03:27.970> our<00:03:28.000> pieces<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.840> now

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
alrighty we have all our pieces and now

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.620 
alrighty we have all our pieces and now
we're<00:03:29.110> going<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.410> once<00:03:30.100> again<00:03:30.310> make<00:03:30.730> them<00:03:30.970> into

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
we're going to once again make them into

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.570 
we're going to once again make them into
legs

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
legs

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.190 
legs
we're<00:03:33.580> going<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.910> put<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.270> dab<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.660> glue<00:03:34.990> on<00:03:35.170> the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
we're going to put a dab of glue on the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.240 
we're going to put a dab of glue on the
end<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.709> each<00:03:35.830> piece<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:37.590> then<00:03:38.590> curl<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.160> over

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
end of each piece and then curl it over

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.570 
end of each piece and then curl it over
like<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.959> make<00:03:41.110> our<00:03:41.140> loop<00:03:41.470> alright<00:03:42.340> once

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
like that to make our loop alright once

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.940 
like that to make our loop alright once
again<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.270> all<00:03:43.420> our<00:03:43.480> loops<00:03:43.900> made<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
again we have all our loops made and

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.740 
again we have all our loops made and
then<00:03:45.459> we're<00:03:45.610> going<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.910> continue<00:03:46.209> sticking

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
then we're going to continue sticking

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:58.960 
then we're going to continue sticking
them<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.580> our<00:03:48.580> bow

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.210 

okay

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
okay

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.150 
okay
the<00:04:01.700> next<00:04:02.060> step<00:04:02.300> we're<00:04:03.110> going<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.380> take<00:04:03.620> our

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the next step we're going to take our

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.810 
the next step we're going to take our
button<00:04:04.580> or<00:04:04.820> our<00:04:05.060> flat<00:04:05.360> back<00:04:05.570> speed<00:04:06.550> gonna<00:04:07.550> put

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
button or our flat back speed gonna put

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.690 
button or our flat back speed gonna put
some<00:04:08.060> hot<00:04:08.420> glue<00:04:08.600> on<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.930> back<00:04:09.110> of<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:12.520> and<00:04:13.520> then

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
some hot glue on the back of it and then

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.110 
some hot glue on the back of it and then
stick<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.060> down<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.480> right<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.930> center

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
stick it down and right in the center

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:37.500 
stick it down and right in the center
this<00:04:17.120> just<00:04:17.390> helps<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.780> look<00:04:17.900> more<00:04:18.170> finished

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.910

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
then you're done you can make a whole

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.680 
then you're done you can make a whole
bunch<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.250> different<00:04:43.580> colors<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.940> whole<00:04:44.540> bunch
