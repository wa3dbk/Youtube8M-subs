00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 was two boys are among those who 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.680
 today I 'm here as a video in which this 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.049
 once instead we will go to compare the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 20 people against the axis around before 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.290
 to start you remember I don't like it 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.030
 because it only takes two seconds 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.889
 leaving the facebook page instead 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.839
 find in the description of this video 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.550
 also subscribe to the channel for others 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 content if you haven't done it yet 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.180
 ok let's start right away anyway if 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 I wanted to say about the girls things there 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.160
 first is that if you see usual results 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 that you have seen towards ati 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 20 against the hearing and minds 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 against the series 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.469
 obviously the results of t 20 this is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.719
 normal just guys i decided 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.700
 not to redo the 20 test again 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 because I didn't think it particularly 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
 needed a lot if you do something 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 will vary by a few cents per 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 this I put the usual results into 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 this video you saw in the videos 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 I saw another thing that kept us 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.820
 say that many of the comments less than 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.710
 in the final tests I was using the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.829
 wake and player help queued in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.289
 reality guys if you run a race 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.870
 without collisions from point to point il 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.060
 game will automatically disable both 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 the trails that aid players in the queue 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 so if you run a race without collisions 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 and as if you were competing alone or 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.970
 however with ghosts e 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.240
 practically the clashes with yours 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 opponents will not affect the impact 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 however the wakes are the race in short 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
 as if you are competing alone against the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.430
 time who makes the best time 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 obviously wins practically this way 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.540
 so don't worry, that's all 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.640
 how balanced everything 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.860
 balanced we have the first results e 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 we can understand this around 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.009
 obviously lazio around as well 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.869
 many of you know he really has 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.150
 a great acceleration we'll go to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.079
 see if the presentiments will succeed in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 beat even if slightly at least 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.049
 acceleration around the hdz because 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 as you know, however, is already around 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.789
 keeps an excellent acceleration but not 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 a maximum speed really who knows 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.460
 how fantastic we can say here 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.170
 let's see what ours will do instead 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.259
 picassi osiris modified and gives us 21 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.390
 seconds and 16 cents 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.310
 here are the results at the airport 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 that we had with the company 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.060
 modified to the modified attack the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.730
 preceding the unmodified winds and the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 first genti 20 modified instead here we are 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.920
 here you already have one-on-one grace 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.560
 let's compare head to head 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.500
 20 people against the axis around and 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.360
 we can understand that initially the pro 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.220
 genti 20 manages to have an excellent 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.660
 acceleration instead we see if at least 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.610
 in this comparison 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.280
 the uds around will be able to recover but 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.680
 apparently these two vehicles have 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.930
 a very high top speed indeed 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.690
 I obviously repeated the same thing 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.090
 test twice to see what happened 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.560
 and in the second test strangely anyway 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.500
 whether we were able to leave a little 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.209
 better, however, let's say that towards the end 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 we can note that in any case it is the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.069
 present winds at a maximum speed a 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.380
 little bit better than the company 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.480
 same thing about acceleration 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.090
 obviously I performed the usual test 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.519
 also in the long track and results 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.910
 they have practically been more or less 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.530
 the ones you saw on the tracks 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.510
 courts or that the 20 people succeed 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.510
 to have a little acceleration 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.329
 better than the zen came back like 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.150
 also its maximum speed then in 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.819
 we can briefly say that the people 20 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.819
 to performance a little better 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.010
 compared to the zen I come back and I also think the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.230
 its maneuverability even if it is anyway 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.970
 Lazio around is quite maneuverable 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.889
 these two cars are very similar though 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.049
 I can say that it is present anyway 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.359
 20 is a little bit better respect 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.180
 the company was not to decide whether it is 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:50.000
 however, the pro 20 is worth his 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.340
 price however is better even if it has 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.919
 performance a little bit worse 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.069
 take a beautiful zen I come back there 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.269
 I remember there are other comparisons 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.129
 I will release all comparisons of the 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.599
 cars I made on the canal in the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.950
 description of this video as well 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.840
 his playlist 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.060
 go and look at the comparisons of the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.620
 20 with the audio is the series you are still 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.379
 in doubt to purchase this vehicle 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.319
 also let you also videos 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.820
 comparisons of the incau indicator with le 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.130
 various bikes of the game that made the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.169
 enemy one starter will always leave i 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.300
 video in the description of this video 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.830
 this staff is said but there 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.840
 just want in 2 seconds click on 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.430
 blue button lets do instead 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.260
 facebook the Germans elsewhere but this one 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.669
 video also subscribe to the channel 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.639
 still be made for other content 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.270
 from the throne xe tuto or the next 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.270
