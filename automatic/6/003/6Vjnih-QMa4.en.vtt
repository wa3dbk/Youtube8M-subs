booger<00:00:25.380> when<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> developed<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.789> tire<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.390> was

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
booger when I developed this tire I was

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080 
booger when I developed this tire I was
looking<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
looking at what I really like in the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
looking at what I really like in the
tire<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.689> also<00:00:30.869> some<00:00:31.590> things<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.920> Kanda

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
tires that were already in the line it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
has my signature 55 embedded in the side

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
has my signature 55 embedded in the side
knobs<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> center<00:00:41.280> knobs<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
knobs and also in the center knobs it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.750 
knobs and also in the center knobs it
has<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:43.110> more<00:00:43.320> open<00:00:43.739> pattern<00:00:44.100> than<00:00:44.309> most<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
has a bit more open pattern than most of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
has a bit more open pattern than most of
the<00:00:44.850> tires<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the tires that they have and that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
the tires that they have and that
openness<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.370> creates<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.850> few<00:00:48.090> different

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
openness really creates a few different

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
openness really creates a few different
things<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.320> good<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> mud

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
things one it's really good in the mud

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.630 
things one it's really good in the mud
and<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.809> has<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.530> good<00:00:52.860> cornering

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and it also has a really good cornering

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
and it also has a really good cornering
knob<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.500> something<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.829> I've

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
knob and that's just something that I've

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
knob and that's just something that I've
always<00:00:56.340> liked<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> tire

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
always liked in a tire

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.299 
always liked in a tire
it's<00:00:57.899> nice<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.620> you're<00:00:58.770> leaning<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's nice when you're leaning into a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.150 
it's nice when you're leaning into a
corner<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.210> feel<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> edge

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
corner you can really feel that edge

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
corner you can really feel that edge
also<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> center<00:01:03.030> knobs<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.570> kind

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
also because the center knobs are kind

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
also because the center knobs are kind
of<00:01:04.320> spaced<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:05.070> bit<00:01:05.220> further<00:01:05.729> apart<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
of spaced a little bit further apart it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.859 
of spaced a little bit further apart it
really<00:01:06.990> provides<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.770> braking<00:01:08.360> on<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
really provides good braking on the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
really provides good braking on the
front<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> knob<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.220> ramp

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
front of the knob I put a little ramp

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
front of the knob I put a little ramp
but<00:01:12.119> there's<00:01:12.299> still<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:13.020> millimeter<00:01:13.439> or

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
but there's still just a millimeter or

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.149 
but there's still just a millimeter or
two<00:01:14.600> sharp<00:01:15.600> edge<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.160 
Jill and myself both one of the world
championships<00:01:51.400> on<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.700> tire<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.300> won<00:01:53.050> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
championships on the tire I won the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.610 
championships on the tire I won the
World<00:01:53.380> Cup

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
World Cup

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.010 
World Cup
overall<00:01:54.160> won<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> bunch<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.090> World<00:01:55.300> Cups<00:01:55.570> I

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
overall won a bunch of World Cups I

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.660 
overall won a bunch of World Cups I
think<00:01:56.380> that's<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.590> pretty<00:01:56.710> good<00:01:56.830> testament<00:01:57.490> of

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
think that's a pretty good testament of

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.960 
think that's a pretty good testament of
how<00:01:58.300> good<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.960> tire<00:01:59.229> work<00:01:59.670> first<00:02:00.670> year

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
how good the tire work first year

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.270 
how good the tire work first year
straight<00:02:01.240> out<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.540> gates<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.200> don't<00:02:03.070> think<00:02:03.220> we

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
straight out the gates I don't think we

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.540 
straight out the gates I don't think we
could<00:02:03.430> ask<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:03.790> much<00:02:04.000> more<00:02:04.030> than<00:02:04.240> that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
could ask for much more than that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.150 
could ask for much more than that
so<00:02:06.550> for<00:02:06.850> 2009<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:07.720> have<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> new<00:02:08.289> tire<00:02:08.560> coming<00:02:09.009> out

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
so for 2009 I have a new tire coming out

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.250 
so for 2009 I have a new tire coming out
it's<00:02:09.670> called<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.970> BBG<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.690> basically<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
it's called the BBG and basically the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.070 
it's called the BBG and basically the
BBG<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> tire<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.430> designed<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.630> fill

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
BBG is a tire that I designed to fill

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.140 
BBG is a tire that I designed to fill
another<00:02:14.350> gap<00:02:14.709> kind<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.490> Kendall<00:02:15.940> line

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
another gap kind of in that Kendall line

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.790 
another gap kind of in that Kendall line
that<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.450> felt<00:02:16.750> they<00:02:16.900> didn't<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> tire<00:02:17.770> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that I felt they didn't have a tire that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.250 
that I felt they didn't have a tire that
fit<00:02:18.220> perfectly<00:02:18.370> into<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.330> said<00:02:19.840> before<00:02:20.050> I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
fit perfectly into I said before I

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.900 
fit perfectly into I said before I
really<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> tire<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.160> has<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.459> really

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
really like a tire that has a really

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.930 
really like a tire that has a really
good<00:02:22.320> cornering<00:02:23.320> knob<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.250> BBG<00:02:24.700> will

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
good cornering knob and the BBG will

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000 
good cornering knob and the BBG will
definitely<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> cornering<00:02:26.500> knob<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.860> is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
definitely have a cornering knob that is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.120 
definitely have a cornering knob that is
is<00:02:27.340> very<00:02:27.730> similar<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.870> El<00:02:28.989> mocha<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.980> big

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
is very similar to the El mocha the big

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.680 
is very similar to the El mocha the big
difference<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.670> gonna<00:02:30.790> be<00:02:31.060> really<00:02:31.330> in<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
difference is gonna be really in the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.990 
difference is gonna be really in the
center<00:02:32.350> knob<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:33.040> be<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> tire<00:02:33.489> that's<00:02:33.670> really

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
center knob to be a tire that's really

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.240 
center knob to be a tire that's really
good<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.390> any<00:02:34.630> type<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.930> maybe<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:36.100> know

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
good for any type of maybe you know

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.360 
good for any type of maybe you know
harder<00:02:36.670> pack<00:02:36.940> terrain<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:39.100> know<00:02:39.190> you're

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
harder pack terrain that you know you're

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.920 
harder pack terrain that you know you're
really<00:02:39.550> looking<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> try<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> carry<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.750> most

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
really looking to try to carry the most

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.870 
really looking to try to carry the most
momentum<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.770> one<00:02:41.950> thing<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.340> also<00:02:42.520> tried<00:02:42.850> to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
momentum the one thing I also tried to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.540 
momentum the one thing I also tried to
put<00:02:43.150> into<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.840> BBG<00:02:44.320> tire<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.950> tried<00:02:45.520> to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
put into the BBG tire is tried to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.850 
put into the BBG tire is tried to
provide<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.000> little<00:02:46.390> small<00:02:46.780> gap<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.380> between

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
provide a little small gap in between

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.220 
provide a little small gap in between
every<00:02:48.400> third<00:02:48.700> knob<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.330> every<00:02:49.660> second<00:02:50.110> knob

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
every third knob and every second knob

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.680 
every third knob and every second knob
it's<00:02:50.500> kind<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.800> offsets<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.760> basically<00:02:52.450> what

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
it's kind of offsets but basically what

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.479 
it's kind of offsets but basically what
that<00:02:52.840> little<00:02:53.080> gap<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.410> gonna<00:02:53.560> do<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:54.070> provide<00:02:54.430> a

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
that little gap is gonna do is provide a

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.250 
that little gap is gonna do is provide a
good<00:02:54.790> little<00:02:55.000> braking<00:02:55.480> edge<00:02:55.630> that's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
good little braking edge that's

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.440 
good little braking edge that's
something<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> lot<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.640> tires<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.090> roll

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
something that a lot of tires that roll

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.840 
something that a lot of tires that roll
really<00:02:58.690> fast<00:02:59.049> don't<00:02:59.530> provide<00:02:59.920> with<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
really fast don't provide with the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.810 
really fast don't provide with the
addition<00:03:01.299> of<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.600> BBB<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.500> 2009<00:03:03.190> line<00:03:03.489> and
