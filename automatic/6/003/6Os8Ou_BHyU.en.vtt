so let me talk about it I'm not bashing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
so let me talk about it I'm not bashing
it<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:02.820> great<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it if you like it that's great it's not

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.939 
it if you like it that's great it's not
a<00:01:04.049> huge<00:01:04.199> fan<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> myself

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
a huge fan of it myself

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
a huge fan of it myself
so<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.700> g11<00:01:06.030> assault<00:01:06.510> rifle<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> 3<00:01:07.530> verse

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so the g11 assault rifle is a 3 verse

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000 
so the g11 assault rifle is a 3 verse
bucket<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.930> pretty<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.500> has<00:01:10.530> pretty<00:01:10.860> low

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
bucket it is pretty it has pretty low

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
bucket it is pretty it has pretty low
recoil<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:11.880> again<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> 3<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
recoil but then again it's a 3 it's a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
recoil but then again it's a 3 it's a
burst<00:01:13.350> weapon<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:14.040> lowly<00:01:14.520> coil<00:01:14.820> isn't

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
burst weapon you know lowly coil isn't

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
burst weapon you know lowly coil isn't
extremely<00:01:15.570> effective<00:01:15.990> unless<00:01:16.500> you're

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
extremely effective unless you're

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
extremely effective unless you're
looking<00:01:16.979> down<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> sniper<00:01:18.240> scope<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
looking down like a sniper scope like I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
looking down like a sniper scope like I

do a lot of this theme so I'm sure it
helped<00:01:20.729> me<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> scope

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
helped me out a lot because of the scope

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.480 
helped me out a lot because of the scope
that<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.320> using<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> game<00:01:23.100> but

I'll tell you but anyway the g11 slow
recoil<00:01:41.340> isn't<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.790> huge<00:01:42.000> selling<00:01:42.360> factor<00:01:42.720> for

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
recoil isn't a huge selling factor for

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929

me the m16 with a red dot sight
I<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.540> recoil<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.049> between

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
I don't know this recoil in between

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
I don't know this recoil in between
bursts<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> returns<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.399> its<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> red<00:01:48.420> dot

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
bursts it returns to its the the red dot

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.149 
bursts it returns to its the the red dot
sight<00:01:48.899> where<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> green<00:01:49.380> doubt<00:01:49.590> sight<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.009> my

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
sight where the green doubt sight in my

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
sight where the green doubt sight in my
case<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.570> radical<00:01:52.049> color<00:01:52.439> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
case is I that's the radical color I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.429 
case is I that's the radical color I
have<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.369> guns<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.659> green<00:01:55.049> color

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
have on all my guns is the green color

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.700 
have on all my guns is the green color
but<00:01:56.340> yeah<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.149> green<00:01:57.329> dot<00:01:57.479> sight<00:01:57.719> I'm

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
but yeah with the green dot sight I'm

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
but yeah with the green dot sight I'm
fine<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.219> returns<00:01:59.549> right<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.240> its

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
fine it returns right back to its

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.880 
fine it returns right back to its
original<00:02:00.450> resting<00:02:01.049> position<00:02:01.409> after<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.680> shoot

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
original resting position after I shoot

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.850 
original resting position after I shoot
it<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.070> m16<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.990> low<00:02:04.110> recoil<00:02:04.439> isn't

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it with the m16 so the low recoil isn't

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.370 
it with the m16 so the low recoil isn't
the<00:02:05.040> selling

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the selling

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.400 
the selling
for<00:02:05.680> me<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:06.610> seems<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.180> g18<00:02:07.450> has<00:02:08.050> a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
for me it seems that the g18 has a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.820 
for me it seems that the g18 has a
higher<00:02:09.750> fire<00:02:10.750> rate<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.020> by<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> mean<00:02:11.680> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
higher fire rate and by that I mean it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.890 
higher fire rate and by that I mean it
is<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.099> lower<00:02:12.250> time<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.819> between<00:02:12.970> bursts<00:02:13.660> not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
is the lower time in between bursts not

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.370 
is the lower time in between bursts not
necessarily<00:02:14.500> an<00:02:14.920> actual<00:02:15.340> higher<00:02:15.610> fire<00:02:16.000> rate

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
necessarily an actual higher fire rate

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.900 
necessarily an actual higher fire rate
again<00:02:17.380> not<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.860> were<00:02:18.190> than<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.519> me<00:02:18.640> because

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
again not that were than to me because

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.780 
again not that were than to me because
it<00:02:19.030> seems<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.599> g11<00:02:19.890> could<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.310> stands<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
it seems that the g11 could it stands to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.720 
it seems that the g11 could it stands to
benefit<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> lot<00:02:22.480> from<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.739> red<00:02:23.890> dot<00:02:24.069> sight<00:02:24.370> or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
benefit a lot from the red dot sight or

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.339 
benefit a lot from the red dot sight or
possibly<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.180> suppressor<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:25.900> again<00:02:26.230> it

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
possibly a suppressor but again it

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.309 
possibly a suppressor but again it
doesn't<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.709> those<00:02:26.890> things<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.810> also<00:02:28.810> it's

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
doesn't have those things and also it's

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.229 
doesn't have those things and also it's
just<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.860> seems<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.280> less<00:02:30.459> reliable<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:31.090> far

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
just it seems to be less reliable as far

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.699 
just it seems to be less reliable as far
as<00:02:31.300> one<00:02:31.510> burst<00:02:31.750> shots<00:02:32.050> go<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.380> doesn't<00:02:32.530> feel

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
as one burst shots go it doesn't feel

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.440 
as one burst shots go it doesn't feel
like<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.980> has<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.099> lot<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.340> power<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.180> I

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
like it has a lot of power to it and I

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.300 
like it has a lot of power to it and I
don't<00:02:34.569> mean<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.780> because<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.440> recoil<00:02:36.130> of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
don't mean that because of the recoil of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.729 
don't mean that because of the recoil of
the<00:02:36.370> way<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.640> sounds<00:02:37.209> or<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:38.110> feel<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.440> it

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
the way it sounds or the feel of it

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.410 
the way it sounds or the feel of it
whatever<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.099> mean<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.730> know<00:02:39.849> with

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
whatever I mean you know with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.449 
whatever I mean you know with
experiences<00:02:41.140> from<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.680> or<00:02:41.799> with<00:02:41.980> experience

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
experiences from it or with experience

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.979 
experiences from it or with experience
with<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.360> honestly<00:02:43.480> say<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
with it I can honestly say that it

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.449 
with it I can honestly say that it
doesn't<00:02:44.260> seem<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.799> as<00:02:44.920> much<00:02:45.040> power<00:02:45.280> as

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
doesn't seem to have as much power as

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.300 
doesn't seem to have as much power as
the<00:02:45.730> m16<00:02:46.269> does<00:02:46.450> consistently<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.769> choose<00:02:48.160> to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the m16 does consistently so I choose to

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.880 
the m16 does consistently so I choose to
use<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.580> m16<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:49.360> as<00:02:50.080> far<00:02:50.230> as<00:02:50.290> attachments

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
use the m16 over as far as attachments

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.680 
use the m16 over as far as attachments
go<00:02:50.920> no<00:02:51.459> attachment<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.239> way<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> go<00:02:52.660> on

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
go no attachment is the way to go on

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.930 
go no attachment is the way to go on
this<00:02:52.989> because<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.920> feels<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.849> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
this because it feels like you have a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.490 
this because it feels like you have a
center<00:02:55.299> bags<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.959> you're<00:02:56.140> into<00:02:56.349> being

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
center bags on and you're into being

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.039 
center bags on and you're into being
because<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.010> start<00:02:57.370> off<00:02:57.519> with<00:02:57.880> 48<00:02:58.329> rounds<00:02:58.480> in

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
because you start off with 48 rounds in

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.930 
because you start off with 48 rounds in
your<00:02:59.230> clip<00:02:59.440> instead<00:02:59.799> of<00:03:00.069> 30<00:03:00.430> which<00:03:00.730> would

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
your clip instead of 30 which would

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.490 
your clip instead of 30 which would
start<00:03:01.180> with<00:03:01.299> your<00:03:01.450> most<00:03:01.660> assault<00:03:02.019> rifles<00:03:02.349> and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
start with your most assault rifles and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.110 
start with your most assault rifles and
most<00:03:02.680> weapons<00:03:02.860> at<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.160> game<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.819> that's

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
most weapons at the game so that's

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.610 
most weapons at the game so that's
actually<00:03:04.269> going<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.630> give<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:04.989> little<00:03:05.440> bit

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
actually going to give you a little bit

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.059 
actually going to give you a little bit
more<00:03:05.860> than<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.599> 150<00:03:07.599> percent<00:03:07.959> ammo<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:08.950> you

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
more than the 150 percent ammo that you

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.009 
more than the 150 percent ammo that you
would<00:03:09.190> normally<00:03:09.370> get<00:03:09.730> with<00:03:09.970> extended<00:03:10.540> mags<00:03:10.750> or

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
would normally get with extended mags or

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.990 
would normally get with extended mags or
200%<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:12.069> you're<00:03:12.190> using<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.459> shotgun<00:03:12.700> or

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
200% if you're using a shotgun or

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.599 
200% if you're using a shotgun or
whatever<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:14.500> yeah<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.739> think<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.519> know

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
whatever but yeah I think that you know

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.660 
whatever but yeah I think that you know
that's<00:03:15.989> again<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.019> seem<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.470> be<00:03:18.190> dwelling<00:03:18.370> on

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
that's again I seem to be dwelling on

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.460 
that's again I seem to be dwelling on
the<00:03:18.790> fact<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.209> don't<00:03:19.390> love<00:03:19.660> this<00:03:19.840> gun<00:03:20.079> but

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
the fact that I don't love this gun but

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.140 
the fact that I don't love this gun but
it's<00:03:20.590> still<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.100> good<00:03:21.280> gun<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.819> I<00:03:21.850> don't<00:03:22.030> want

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it's still and good gun and I don't want

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.849 
it's still and good gun and I don't want
to<00:03:22.209> discourage<00:03:22.600> anybody<00:03:22.989> from<00:03:23.170> trying<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.769> out

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
to discourage anybody from trying it out

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.710 
to discourage anybody from trying it out
so<00:03:24.459> even<00:03:25.060> though<00:03:25.180> I'm<00:03:25.269> being<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.510> negative

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
so even though I'm being a negative

Nelly enstein even though I'm talking a
lot<00:03:27.819> of<00:03:27.910> crap<00:03:28.120> about<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.510> gun<00:03:28.720> I'm<00:03:29.049> still

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.509 
gonna say go ahead and try it out so for
this<00:03:31.810> game<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.170> was<00:03:32.290> using<00:03:32.500> obviously<00:03:32.889> my

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
this game I was using obviously my

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.940 
this game I was using obviously my
favorite<00:03:33.760> setup<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.660> UAV<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.380> Blackbird<00:03:35.920> and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
favorite setup the UAV the Blackbird and

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.550 
favorite setup the UAV the Blackbird and
the<00:03:36.310> chopper<00:03:36.609> gunner<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.090> stand<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.930> benefit

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the chopper gunner I stand to benefit

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740 
the chopper gunner I stand to benefit
the<00:03:38.709> most<00:03:38.859> from<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.220> setup<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.790> seems<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.299> can

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
the most from that setup it seems I can

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.360 
the most from that setup it seems I can
usually<00:03:40.900> get<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.230> chopper<00:03:41.530> gunner<00:03:41.739> at<00:03:42.100> least

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
usually get the chopper gunner at least

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.670 
usually get the chopper gunner at least
once<00:03:42.670> every<00:03:42.819> two<00:03:43.090> games<00:03:43.329> if<00:03:43.720> not<00:03:43.959> once<00:03:44.380> every

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
once every two games if not once every

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.160 
once every two games if not once every
game<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:46.120> seem<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.660> lot<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:46.870> success

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
game and I seem to have a lot of success

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.660 
game and I seem to have a lot of success
when<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.650> can<00:03:47.799> get<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> chopper<00:03:48.310> gunner

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
when I can get the chopper gunner

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.940 
when I can get the chopper gunner
unfortunately<00:03:49.420> this<00:03:49.569> game<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.049> got<00:03:50.530> shot<00:03:50.769> down

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
unfortunately this game I got shot down

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.770 
unfortunately this game I got shot down
and<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.519> think<00:03:51.579> I<00:03:51.910> got<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.269> chopper<00:03:52.569> gunner<00:03:52.720> I

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
and I think I got to chopper gunner I

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.569 
and I think I got to chopper gunner I
got<00:03:53.019> shot<00:03:53.200> down<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.440> both<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.739> them<00:03:53.889> relatively

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
got shot down on both of them relatively

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.340 
got shot down on both of them relatively
fast<00:03:54.850> they<00:03:55.180> weren't<00:03:55.420> too<00:03:55.540> effective<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.200> that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
fast they weren't too effective but that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.300 
fast they weren't too effective but that
just<00:03:56.530> makes<00:03:56.680> for<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.889> little<00:03:57.040> bit<00:03:57.130> more

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
just makes for a little bit more

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.860 
just makes for a little bit more
entertaining<00:03:57.850> gameplay<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.329> little<00:03:58.569> bit<00:03:58.690> more

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
entertaining gameplay a little bit more

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.539 
entertaining gameplay a little bit more

possibly new you guys flak jackets so
flak<00:04:11.889> jacket<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.370> something<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.819> I<00:04:12.880> was<00:04:13.060> very

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
flak jacket is something that I was very

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.140 
flak jacket is something that I was very
very<00:04:13.989> excited<00:04:14.530> for<00:04:14.739> before<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.759> release<00:04:15.970> of

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
very excited for before the release of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.810 
very excited for before the release of
black<00:04:16.239> ops<00:04:16.509> but<00:04:16.870> it's<00:04:17.109> come

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
black ops but it's come

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.909 
black ops but it's come
I<00:04:18.820> realized<00:04:19.389> that<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.900> not<00:04:19.989> as<00:04:20.350> effective<00:04:20.590> as

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
I realized that it's not as effective as

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.370 
I realized that it's not as effective as
I<00:04:21.100> originally<00:04:21.549> thought<00:04:21.609> not<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.540> it's<00:04:23.139> bad

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
I originally thought not that it's bad

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.530 
I originally thought not that it's bad
not<00:04:23.919> at<00:04:24.100> all<00:04:24.310> but<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.699> just<00:04:24.850> seems<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.180> four

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
not at all but it just seems like four

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.150 
not at all but it just seems like four
names<00:04:25.720> themselves<00:04:25.960> aren't<00:04:26.650> nearly<00:04:27.040> as

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
names themselves aren't nearly as

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.280 
names themselves aren't nearly as
powerful<00:04:27.430> as<00:04:27.850> they<00:04:28.000> were<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.630> previous<00:04:29.110> Call

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
powerful as they were in previous Call

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.530 
powerful as they were in previous Call
of<00:04:29.320> Duty<00:04:29.500> games<00:04:29.680> which<00:04:29.949> is<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.370> huge<00:04:30.880> posit<00:04:31.510> that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
that a flak jacket does exactly what it

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.379 
that a flak jacket does exactly what it
says<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.139> does<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.800> know<00:04:38.889> pretty<00:04:39.160> much<00:04:39.389> does

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
everything this is it does and more it

that<00:05:03.010> kind<00:05:03.160> of<00:05:03.190> stuff<00:05:03.310> unless<00:05:03.729> they<00:05:04.000> actually

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
that kind of stuff unless they actually

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.920 
that kind of stuff unless they actually
hit<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.020> that's<00:05:05.350> really<00:05:05.860> really<00:05:06.160> awesome

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930

your<00:05:07.930> health<00:05:08.169> regenerates<00:05:08.680> fairly<00:05:09.070> fast<00:05:09.340> and

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
your health regenerates fairly fast and

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.480 
your health regenerates fairly fast and
it<00:05:10.780> doesn't<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.289> know<00:05:11.410> obstructing<00:05:12.370> your

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
it doesn't you know obstructing your

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.830 
it doesn't you know obstructing your
view<00:05:12.699> like<00:05:12.970> bombs<00:05:13.180> -<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:13.449> didn't<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:13.780> the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
view like bombs - I didn't in the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.050 
view like bombs - I didn't in the
previous<00:05:14.169> scene<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.620> really<00:05:14.860> like<00:05:15.039> that<00:05:15.070> it

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
previous scene so I really like that it

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.400 
previous scene so I really like that it
just<00:05:16.240> seems<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:16.539> benefit<00:05:16.870> players<00:05:17.110> who<00:05:17.289> like

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
just seems to benefit players who like

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.140 
just seems to benefit players who like
to<00:05:17.470> rush<00:05:17.830> along<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.310> play<00:05:18.430> very<00:05:18.580> aggressively

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
to rush along and play very aggressively

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.700 
to rush along and play very aggressively
so<00:05:19.449> that's<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.720> kind<00:05:19.870> of<00:05:19.900> player<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.169> are<00:05:20.260> you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
so that's the kind of player you are you

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.890 
so that's the kind of player you are you
stand<00:05:20.949> a<00:05:21.039> benefit<00:05:21.370> from<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.550> lot<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.630> simply

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
stand a benefit from a lot I just simply

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.000 
stand a benefit from a lot I just simply
don't<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.440> don't<00:05:23.470> use<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:23.979> much

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
don't and I don't use it that much

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.370 
don't and I don't use it that much
because<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.970> mainly<00:05:25.210> play<00:05:25.330> not<00:05:25.810> objective<00:05:26.200> many

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
because I mainly play not objective many

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.860 
because I mainly play not objective many
types<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.889> I<00:05:27.639> do<00:05:27.940> play<00:05:28.120> objective<00:05:28.510> mean<00:05:28.660> type

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
types and I do play objective mean type

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.080 
types and I do play objective mean type
