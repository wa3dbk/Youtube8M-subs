counter<00:01:01.330> but<00:01:01.659> no<00:01:02.290> he<00:01:02.710> goes<00:01:02.949> into<00:01:03.280> his<00:01:03.370> Aptos

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
let me know so when I go to my scissor

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.690 
let me know so when I go to my scissor
here<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.950> wanted<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.039> feel<00:01:36.250> mount<00:01:36.549> was

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
here and I wanted to feel mount was

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.459 
here and I wanted to feel mount was
predicting<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.299> probable<00:01:37.719> sub<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.229> I<00:01:38.259> went

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
predicting the probable sub so I went

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.580 
predicting the probable sub so I went
for<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.649> u-turn<00:01:39.009> here<00:01:39.070> but<00:01:40.049> my<00:01:41.409> revenge

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590

for a u-turn here but my revenge
that's<00:01:42.070> what<00:01:42.219> you<00:01:42.340> get<00:01:42.490> for<00:01:42.729> using<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.329> scissor

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
that's what you get for using a scissor

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.920 
that's what you get for using a scissor
and<00:01:43.750> Tran<00:01:44.109> so<00:01:44.859> anyway<00:01:45.520> I<00:01:45.729> go<00:01:46.000> into<00:01:46.210> starmie<00:01:46.719> who

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
hope wish there was hadn't been a sub

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.800 
hope wish there was hadn't been a sub
there<00:01:51.789> but<00:01:52.119> whatever<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.810> he<00:01:53.770> stays<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.369> and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.160 

gets<00:01:58.810> my<00:01:59.399> yeah<00:02:00.399> I'm<00:02:00.549> faster<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.840> take<00:02:02.140> a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
gets my yeah I'm faster and I take a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.560 
gets my yeah I'm faster and I take a
surf<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:02.979> take<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.549> pretty<00:02:03.729> nicely<00:02:03.969> I<00:02:04.210> switch

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
surf so take that pretty nicely I switch

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.349 
surf so take that pretty nicely I switch
out<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:04.899> my<00:02:05.020> Gera<00:02:05.380> now<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.850> intimidate

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
out to my Gera now get the intimidate

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.690 
out to my Gera now get the intimidate
and<00:02:07.600> I'm<00:02:07.929> predicting<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.619> probable<00:02:09.160> u-turn

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and I'm predicting the probable u-turn

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.130 
and I'm predicting the probable u-turn
he<00:02:10.119> does<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.230> that's<00:02:11.410> awesome<00:02:11.710> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
he does do that so that's awesome and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.740 
he does do that so that's awesome and
goes<00:02:14.140> into<00:02:14.470> his<00:02:14.560> weevil<00:02:14.920> again<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
goes into his weevil again so now I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.930 
goes into his weevil again so now I
haven't<00:02:17.560> had<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> chance<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.310> set<00:02:18.550> up<00:02:18.640> stealth

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
haven't had a chance to set up stealth

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.140 
haven't had a chance to set up stealth
rocks<00:02:19.210> yet<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:19.870> still<00:02:20.200> fearing<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.190> very

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
rocks yet so I'm still fearing the very

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.480 
rocks yet so I'm still fearing the very
possible<00:02:22.720> counter<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:24.220> know<00:02:24.280> that's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
possible counter and I know that's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.610 
possible counter and I know that's
probably<00:02:25.120> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> take<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.810> my<00:02:25.840> Gera<00:02:26.260> plus

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
probably going to take out my Gera plus

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.470 
probably going to take out my Gera plus
I<00:02:26.740> don't<00:02:26.800> even<00:02:27.130> have<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.640> intimidate<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.330> him

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
I don't even have the intimidate on him

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.380 
I don't even have the intimidate on him
this<00:02:28.600> time<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.550> he<00:02:30.550> goes<00:02:30.700> for<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.910> night<00:02:31.090> slash

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
this time and he goes for a night slash

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.840 
this time and he goes for a night slash
and<00:02:31.690> again<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.590> went<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
and again I went for the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.380 
and again I went for the
but<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.560> fail<00:02:36.980> because<00:02:37.520> yeah<00:02:38.000> he<00:02:38.150> didn't

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
but that was fail because yeah he didn't

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.660 
but that was fail because yeah he didn't
want<00:02:39.050> me<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:39.440> he<00:02:39.530> gets<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:40.130> quit<00:02:40.460> there

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
want me but he gets a quit there

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.700 
want me but he gets a quit there
so<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.150> really<00:02:41.630> blows<00:02:41.840> my<00:02:42.140> Gera<00:02:42.410> I'm<00:02:42.530> just

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
so that really blows my Gera I'm just

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.800 
so that really blows my Gera I'm just
gonna<00:02:42.800> have<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.010> save<00:02:43.250> for<00:02:43.520> fodder<00:02:43.790> later<00:02:44.180> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
gonna have to save for fodder later and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.110 
gonna have to save for fodder later and
I<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.200> should<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.010> mean<00:02:46.250> still<00:02:46.790> he's

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
I really should have I mean still he's

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
I really should have I mean still he's
using<00:02:47.570> night<00:02:47.810> flash<00:02:48.140> he<00:02:48.380> has<00:02:48.410> encountered<00:02:48.830> yet

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
using night flash he has encountered yet

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.250 
using night flash he has encountered yet
I<00:02:49.490> should<00:02:49.700> have<00:02:50.120> caught<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.930> but

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
I should have caught on to this but

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.280 
I should have caught on to this but
you'll<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.670> here<00:02:53.120> um<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:54.020> for<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
you'll see so here um I go for the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.960 
you'll see so here um I go for the
hidden<00:02:54.530> power<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.660> ice<00:02:56.660> again<00:02:57.440> very<00:02:58.430> much<00:02:58.550> so

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
hidden power and ice again very much so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.350 
hidden power and ice again very much so
and<00:02:59.240> over<00:02:59.840> predict<00:03:00.200> but<00:03:01.190> he<00:03:01.790> goes<00:03:01.970> into<00:03:02.210> his

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and over predict but he goes into his

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.150 
and over predict but he goes into his
Reggie<00:03:02.600> Steele<00:03:02.900> takes<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.650> a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
Reggie Steele takes that like a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.480 
Reggie Steele takes that like a
Beast<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.630> go<00:03:05.810> into<00:03:06.020> my<00:03:06.260> Batman<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.070> I'm

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
Beast and I go into my Batman and I'm

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.980 
Beast and I go into my Batman and I'm
here<00:03:07.850> I'm<00:03:07.970> trying<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.480> battle<00:03:08.810> some

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
here I'm trying in this battle some

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.860 
here I'm trying in this battle some
pokes<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.880> don't<00:03:10.880> normally<00:03:11.090> use<00:03:11.390> or

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
pokes that I don't normally use or

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.690 
pokes that I don't normally use or
haven't<00:03:12.230> used<00:03:12.410> very<00:03:12.620> much<00:03:12.680> Gliscor<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.400> one<00:03:13.580> of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
haven't used very much Gliscor is one of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820 
haven't used very much Gliscor is one of
them<00:03:13.820> I'm<00:03:13.970> not<00:03:14.180> too<00:03:14.360> familiar<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:14.840> them<00:03:15.110> but

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
them I'm not too familiar with them but

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.640 
them I'm not too familiar with them but
um<00:03:16.220> anyway<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.240> went<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.990> earthquake<00:03:18.380> and

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
um anyway I went for the earthquake and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.290 
um anyway I went for the earthquake and
it<00:03:18.920> did<00:03:19.130> over<00:03:19.400> half<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.790> don't<00:03:19.820> know<00:03:20.030> if<00:03:20.120> that's

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
it did over half I don't know if that's

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.320 
it did over half I don't know if that's
max<00:03:20.600> damage<00:03:21.050> but<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.500> did<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.340> lot<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.240> it<00:03:23.300> is

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
max damage but it did a lot and it is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.210 
max damage but it did a lot and it is
super<00:03:23.660> effective<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.380> was<00:03:24.590> very<00:03:24.830> happy

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
super effective so I was very happy

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.120 
super effective so I was very happy
about<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.640> now<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.600> go<00:03:26.960> for<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.530> stealth<00:03:27.830> rock

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
about that now I go for the stealth rock

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.010 
about that now I go for the stealth rock
on<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.400> switch<00:03:28.700> predicting<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.390> switch<00:03:29.660> and

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
on the switch predicting the switch and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.290 
on the switch predicting the switch and
he<00:03:30.470> goes<00:03:30.770> into<00:03:31.010> his<00:03:31.220> Flygon<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:32.060> don't<00:03:32.210> know

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
he goes into his Flygon I don't know

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.420 
he goes into his Flygon I don't know
what<00:03:32.570> he<00:03:32.990> was<00:03:33.110> predicting<00:03:33.620> probably<00:03:34.130> just<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
what he was predicting probably just the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.040 
what he was predicting probably just the
earth<00:03:34.580> turned<00:03:34.940> thought<00:03:35.300> he<00:03:35.480> was<00:03:35.600> predicting

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
earth turned thought he was predicting

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.870 
earth turned thought he was predicting
the<00:03:36.140> earthquake<00:03:36.500> but<00:03:37.010> anyway<00:03:37.280> now<00:03:37.460> his<00:03:37.640> family

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
the earthquake but anyway now his family

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.850 
the earthquake but anyway now his family
moved<00:03:38.300> stone<00:03:38.690> edges<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.260> I'm<00:03:39.380> taking<00:03:39.740> these

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
moved stone edges and I'm taking these

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.190 
moved stone edges and I'm taking these
really<00:03:40.640> well<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:41.060> go<00:03:41.750> from<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.140> toxic<00:03:42.680> I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
really well I go from the toxic I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.490 
really well I go from the toxic I
unfortunately<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.770> this<00:03:46.510> glitz<00:03:47.510> core<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.080> so

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
unfortunately on this glitz core and so

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.670 
unfortunately on this glitz core and so
I<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:49.040> did<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:49.640> on<00:03:49.760> purpose<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.080> don't<00:03:51.350> have

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
I I did it on purpose but I I don't have

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.580 
I I did it on purpose but I I don't have
a<00:03:51.709> move<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.459> can<00:03:52.610> hit<00:03:52.790> his<00:03:52.940> fly<00:03:53.180> gun<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:53.840> if<00:03:54.230> I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
a move that can hit his fly gun but if I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.140 
a move that can hit his fly gun but if I
wanted<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.010> know<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.310> could<00:03:55.550> stall<00:03:55.820> him<00:03:56.000> out

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
wanted to I know I could stall him out

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.640 
wanted to I know I could stall him out
no<00:03:56.390> problem<00:03:56.570> he's<00:03:56.959> not<00:03:57.140> gonna<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.410> able<00:03:57.500> to

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
no problem he's not gonna be able to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.650 
no problem he's not gonna be able to
take<00:03:57.830> me<00:03:58.010> out<00:03:58.130> even<00:03:58.310> with<00:03:58.700> he<00:03:59.270> would<00:03:59.360> have<00:03:59.510> to

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
take me out even with he would have to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.530 
take me out even with he would have to
get<00:03:59.780> one<00:03:59.959> hell<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.320> a<00:04:00.500> massive<00:04:00.920> crit<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:02.030> also

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
get one hell of a massive crit so also

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.740 
get one hell of a massive crit so also
at<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:03.890> point<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:05.860> bring<00:04:06.860> in<00:04:07.220> my<00:04:07.459> heat<00:04:08.450> ran

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
at this point I bring in my heat ran

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.630 
at this point I bring in my heat ran
because<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.260> know<00:04:09.320> I'm<00:04:09.470> scarfed<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.340> one<00:04:10.610> I

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
because I know I'm scarfed and one I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.060 
because I know I'm scarfed and one I
want<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.940> see<00:04:11.060> if<00:04:11.150> he's<00:04:11.270> scarfed<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.930> two<00:04:12.170> I

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
want to see if he's scarfed and two I

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.710 
want to see if he's scarfed and two I
don't<00:04:13.880> think<00:04:14.060> he's<00:04:14.209> going<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.420> be<00:04:14.540> able<00:04:14.600> to

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
don't think he's going to be able to

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.870 
don't think he's going to be able to
take<00:04:14.959> me<00:04:15.140> out<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:15.650> he's<00:04:15.950> stuck<00:04:16.520> into

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
take me out so I think he's stuck into

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.990 
take me out so I think he's stuck into
the<00:04:17.810> stone<00:04:18.109> edge<00:04:18.290> but<00:04:18.620> he<00:04:18.919> gets<00:04:19.160> another<00:04:19.640> crit

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
the stone edge but he gets another crit

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.070 
the stone edge but he gets another crit
ah<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:22.100> he<00:04:22.640> takes<00:04:22.880> me<00:04:23.120> out<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.540> that

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
ah so he takes me out and that

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.360 
ah so he takes me out and that
blows<00:04:24.980> and<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.520> don't<00:04:25.580> get<00:04:25.880> two<00:04:26.000> HP<00:04:26.360> Isum<00:04:26.980> so<00:04:27.980> at

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
blows and I don't get two HP Isum so at

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.670 
blows and I don't get two HP Isum so at
least<00:04:28.610> now<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.940> do<00:04:29.210> know<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:30.020> sure<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.350> he<00:04:30.650> is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
least now I do know for sure that he is

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.730 
least now I do know for sure that he is
scarfed<00:04:31.430> that's<00:04:31.760> good<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.270> bring<00:04:33.169> in<00:04:33.290> my<00:04:33.410> star

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
scarfed that's good I bring in my star

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.040 
scarfed that's good I bring in my star
me<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.580> star<00:04:34.880> me<00:04:35.030> scarfed<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.600> go<00:04:35.780> for<00:04:35.990> the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
me and the star me scarfed I go for the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.990 
me and the star me scarfed I go for the
surf<00:04:36.260> just<00:04:36.650> being<00:04:36.860> kind<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.430> safe<00:04:37.700> move

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
surf just being kind of the safe move

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.610 
surf just being kind of the safe move
because<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.390> know<00:04:38.450> is<00:04:38.690> all<00:04:38.990> different<00:04:39.200> pokes

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
because I know is all different pokes

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.430 
because I know is all different pokes
that<00:04:40.100> resisted<00:04:40.760> all<00:04:40.970> different<00:04:41.300> ways<00:04:41.480> so<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
that resisted all different ways so the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.150 
that resisted all different ways so the
surf<00:04:42.680> was<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:43.220> kind<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.640> safe<00:04:43.910> stab<00:04:44.270> move

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
surf was just kind of the safe stab move

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.280 
surf was just kind of the safe stab move
then<00:04:46.160> Here<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.850> am<00:04:47.120> predicting

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
then Here I am predicting

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.220 
then Here I am predicting
the<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:49.370> was<00:04:49.700> predicting<00:04:50.150> either<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.570> thunder

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
the I was predicting either a thunder

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.010 
the I was predicting either a thunder
punch<00:04:51.500> or<00:04:51.800> T<00:04:52.610> wave<00:04:52.880> he<00:04:53.210> does<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.570> T<00:04:53.780> wave

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
punch or T wave he does the T wave

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.930 
punch or T wave he does the T wave
that's<00:04:54.350> awesome<00:04:54.860> I<00:04:54.950> get<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.130> free<00:04:55.370> switch<00:04:55.700> in

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
that's awesome I get a free switch in

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.170 
that's awesome I get a free switch in
and<00:04:56.770> I'm<00:04:57.770> pretty<00:04:58.010> much<00:04:58.190> thinking<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.610> he

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
and I'm pretty much thinking that he

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.850 
and I'm pretty much thinking that he
couldn't<00:04:59.420> do<00:04:59.540> he<00:05:00.320> was<00:05:00.440> going<00:05:00.680> for<00:05:00.800> the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
couldn't do he was going for the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.800 
couldn't do he was going for the
explode<00:05:01.310> there<00:05:01.580> he<00:05:01.670> said<00:05:01.910> he<00:05:02.120> said<00:05:02.390> that's<00:05:02.600> why

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
explode there he said he said that's why

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.830 
explode there he said he said that's why
he<00:05:03.050> stayed<00:05:03.350> in<00:05:03.530> but<00:05:04.010> as<00:05:04.850> you<00:05:05.390> saw<00:05:05.600> from<00:05:05.780> last

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
he stayed in but as you saw from last

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.780 
he stayed in but as you saw from last
time<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.560> earthquake<00:05:06.950> does<00:05:07.190> do<00:05:07.400> more<00:05:07.610> than

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
time the earthquake does do more than

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.070 
time the earthquake does do more than
half<00:05:07.970> so<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:09.890> rocks<00:05:10.570> here<00:05:11.570> he<00:05:11.870> was

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
half so that rocks here he was

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.140 
half so that rocks here he was
thinking<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.860> he<00:05:13.070> was<00:05:13.160> faster<00:05:13.640> than<00:05:13.670> my<00:05:13.910> clit

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
thinking that he was faster than my clit

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.970 
thinking that he was faster than my clit
score<00:05:14.420> and<00:05:14.660> a<00:05:14.870> lot<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.140> people<00:05:15.440> forget<00:05:15.590> that

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
score and a lot of people forget that

really fast and he's able to outspeed a

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.210 
really fast and he's able to outspeed a
lot<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:28.580> slower<00:05:28.940> pokes<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:31.100> know

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
lot of slower pokes that you know

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.540 
lot of slower pokes that you know
normally<00:05:31.730> uh<00:05:32.620> those<00:05:33.620> folks<00:05:33.920> would<00:05:34.070> out<00:05:34.220> speed

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
normally uh those folks would out speed

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.310 
normally uh those folks would out speed
other<00:05:34.730> walls<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.210> anyway<00:05:35.510> that's<00:05:35.780> cool<00:05:36.050> I<00:05:36.110> take

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
other walls so anyway that's cool I take

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.870 
other walls so anyway that's cool I take
out<00:05:36.470> as<00:05:36.620> in<00:05:36.740> pullian<00:05:37.100> that's<00:05:37.280> one<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.670> last

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
out as in pullian that's one of the last

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.760 
out as in pullian that's one of the last
major<00:05:38.210> threats<00:05:38.660> so<00:05:38.810> here<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.290> made<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.500> real

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
major threats so here I made a real

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.580 
major threats so here I made a real
stupid<00:05:40.040> mistake<00:05:40.520> I<00:05:40.700> should<00:05:41.030> have<00:05:41.320> fodder<00:05:42.320> it

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
stupid mistake I should have fodder it

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.840 
stupid mistake I should have fodder it
brought<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:43.040> that<00:05:45.830> guy<00:05:46.070> Gareth<00:05:46.670> the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
brought in that guy Gareth the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.670 
brought in that guy Gareth the
fodder<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.390> bought<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:47.870> for<00:05:48.050> some<00:05:48.230> reason<00:05:48.260> I<00:05:48.560> was

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
fodder I bought it for some reason I was

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.410 
fodder I bought it for some reason I was
thinking<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.130> I<00:05:49.280> might<00:05:49.370> be<00:05:49.670> able<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:49.940> survive

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
thinking that I might be able to survive

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.520 
thinking that I might be able to survive
the<00:05:50.750> switch<00:05:51.080> in<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:52.120> basically<00:05:53.120> too<00:05:53.600> full<00:05:54.410> of

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
the switch in and basically too full of

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.650 
the switch in and basically too full of
RUP<00:05:54.710> shins<00:05:54.950> but<00:05:55.130> I'm<00:05:55.250> not<00:05:55.430> able<00:05:55.670> to<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:56.300> blows

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
RUP shins but I'm not able to that blows

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.510 
RUP shins but I'm not able to that blows
I<00:05:57.050> was<00:05:57.170> hoping<00:05:57.440> to<00:05:57.500> be<00:05:57.650> able<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.890> t-wave<00:05:58.280> that

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
I was hoping to be able to t-wave that

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.700 
I was hoping to be able to t-wave that
guy<00:05:58.700> because<00:05:58.880> he<00:05:59.120> might<00:05:59.240> be<00:05:59.420> a<00:05:59.450> problem<00:05:59.720> so<00:06:00.650> I

able to get the intimidate now I go to
my<00:06:42.950> star<00:06:43.250> me<00:06:43.430> and<00:06:43.640> it's<00:06:44.390> really<00:06:44.540> my<00:06:44.810> pretty

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
my star me and it's really my pretty

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.660 
my star me and it's really my pretty
much<00:06:45.380> last<00:06:45.590> resort<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:48.190> he<00:06:49.190> still<00:06:49.460> didn't

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
much last resort and he still didn't

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.250 
much last resort and he still didn't
know<00:06:49.700> for<00:06:49.940> sure<00:06:50.000> of<00:06:50.240> how<00:06:50.360> scarf<00:06:50.750> their<00:06:50.960> specs

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260

but<00:06:51.530> I<00:06:51.560> guess<00:06:51.800> just<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:52.430> be<00:06:52.580> careful<00:06:52.990> and<00:06:53.990> also

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
but I guess just to be careful and also

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.860 
but I guess just to be careful and also
so<00:06:54.860> that<00:06:54.890> he<00:06:55.190> could<00:06:55.400> get<00:06:55.640> the<00:06:55.940> fake<00:06:56.420> out<00:06:56.540> again

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870
