kind of blending that concealer up not

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.190 
kind of blending that concealer up not
too<00:04:49.910> high<00:04:50.090> for<00:04:50.330> my<00:04:50.419> brow<00:04:50.600> but<00:04:50.750> really<00:04:50.990> trying

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
too high for my brow but really trying

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.650 
too high for my brow but really trying
to<00:04:51.260> make<00:04:51.380> sure<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:51.919> natural-looking

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
to make sure that it's natural-looking

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.150 
to make sure that it's natural-looking
again<00:04:53.660> take<00:04:53.960> your<00:04:53.990> time<00:04:54.350> here<00:04:54.740> if<00:04:54.890> you<00:04:54.979> use<00:04:55.010> a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
again take your time here if you use a

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.770 
again take your time here if you use a
flat<00:04:55.490> brush<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.910> find<00:04:56.210> this<00:04:56.330> work<00:04:56.570> it's<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
flat brush I find this work it's the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.510 
flat brush I find this work it's the
best<00:04:57.110> cuz<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.440> really<00:04:57.470> gives<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.039> that<00:04:58.190> sharp

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
best cuz it really gives you that sharp

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.700 
best cuz it really gives you that sharp
line<00:04:58.810> especially<00:04:59.810> on<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.020> tail<00:05:00.229> of<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.530> brow

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
line especially on the tail of the brow

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.070 
line especially on the tail of the brow
and<00:05:01.010> yeah<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:01.940> just<00:05:01.970> it<00:05:02.210> totally<00:05:02.539> helps<00:05:02.780> me<00:05:02.930> and

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
and yeah it just it totally helps me and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.930 
and yeah it just it totally helps me and
I<00:05:03.110> find<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.410> makes<00:05:03.530> it<00:05:03.740> ten<00:05:03.950> times<00:05:04.130> easier<00:05:04.430> to

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
I find it makes it ten times easier to

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.440 
I find it makes it ten times easier to
do<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.330> job<00:05:05.360> that's<00:05:05.870> for<00:05:06.200> sure

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
your brows on all day it almost like

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
gives you that natural effect whenever I

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.170 
gives you that natural effect whenever I
tend<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.380> use<00:05:33.470> this<00:05:33.800> gel<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.640> find<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.030> my

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
tend to use this gel I can find that my

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.490 
tend to use this gel I can find that my
brows<00:05:35.420> look<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.720> bit<00:05:35.870> more<00:05:36.020> natural<00:05:36.170> because

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
brows look a bit more natural because

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.860 
brows look a bit more natural because
the<00:05:36.770> gel<00:05:36.980> almost<00:05:37.160> acts<00:05:37.550> as<00:05:37.730> like<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:38.120> separator

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
the gel almost acts as like a separator

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.260 
the gel almost acts as like a separator
so<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.620> doesn't<00:05:39.830> really<00:05:40.150> separate<00:05:41.150> the

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
so it doesn't really separate the

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.910 
so it doesn't really separate the
product<00:05:41.630> too<00:05:41.750> too<00:05:41.930> much<00:05:42.110> but<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.410> does<00:05:42.590> kind<00:05:42.890> of

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
product too too much but it does kind of

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.620 
product too too much but it does kind of
allow<00:05:43.220> them<00:05:43.400> to<00:05:43.520> look<00:05:43.670> a<00:05:43.820> bit<00:05:43.850> more<00:05:44.030> natural

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
allow them to look a bit more natural

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.840 
allow them to look a bit more natural
then<00:05:45.440> I'm<00:05:45.620> just<00:05:45.770> going<00:05:46.010> in<00:05:46.190> here<00:05:46.490> with<00:05:46.670> my

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
then I'm just going in here with my

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.820 
then I'm just going in here with my
highlighter<00:05:47.360> color<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:48.020> just<00:05:48.230> used<00:05:48.470> mine<00:05:48.650> from

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
highlighter color I just used mine from

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.930 
highlighter color I just used mine from
the<00:05:48.950> Naked<00:05:49.280> 2<00:05:49.310> palette

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
the Naked 2 palette

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.300 
the Naked 2 palette
I<00:05:50.030> forgot<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.390> color<00:05:50.600> but<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:50.810> listed<00:05:51.140> below

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
I forgot the color but I listed below

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
I forgot the color but I listed below
it's<00:05:52.310> really<00:05:52.550> good<00:05:52.670> to<00:05:52.760> kind<00:05:52.850> of<00:05:52.940> go<00:05:53.060> in<00:05:53.210> and

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
it's really good to kind of go in and

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.700 
it's really good to kind of go in and
highlight<00:05:53.510> your<00:05:53.810> eyeshadow<00:05:54.200> afterwards

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
highlight your eyeshadow afterwards

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.950 
highlight your eyeshadow afterwards
because<00:05:54.860> sometimes<00:05:55.220> when<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.430> add<00:05:55.640> that

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
because sometimes when you add that

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.510 
because sometimes when you add that
concealer<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:57.590> doesn't<00:05:57.890> do<00:05:57.950> the<00:05:58.040> cutest<00:05:58.340> job

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
concealer it doesn't do the cutest job

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.660 
concealer it doesn't do the cutest job
and<00:05:59.300> I<00:06:00.110> find<00:06:00.320> it's<00:06:00.470> just<00:06:00.650> super<00:06:00.950> nice<00:06:01.100> to<00:06:01.160> go<00:06:01.490> in

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
and I find it's just super nice to go in

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.490 
and I find it's just super nice to go in
and<00:06:01.850> really<00:06:02.390> add<00:06:02.540> that<00:06:02.810> highlight<00:06:03.200> because<00:06:03.380> it

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
and really add that highlight because it

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.250 
and really add that highlight because it
really<00:06:03.770> kind<00:06:03.920> of<00:06:04.070> emphasizes<00:06:04.760> your<00:06:04.790> brows<00:06:05.330> so

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
really kind of emphasizes your brows so

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.990 
really kind of emphasizes your brows so
once<00:06:06.740> you're<00:06:06.950> done<00:06:06.980> doing<00:06:07.100> that<00:06:07.610> that's

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
once you're done doing that that's

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.610 
once you're done doing that that's
basically<00:06:08.360> it<00:06:08.780> that's<00:06:08.990> what<00:06:09.200> I<00:06:09.290> do<00:06:09.440> for<00:06:09.470> my

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
basically it that's what I do for my

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.160 
basically it that's what I do for my
brow<00:06:09.860> tutorial<00:06:10.070> it's<00:06:10.580> pretty<00:06:10.880> easy<00:06:11.170> it

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
brow tutorial it's pretty easy it

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.960 
brow tutorial it's pretty easy it
definitely<00:06:12.500> takes<00:06:12.650> practice<00:06:13.250> but<00:06:13.580> I<00:06:13.610> find

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
definitely takes practice but I find

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.330 
definitely takes practice but I find
that<00:06:14.030> it's<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.690> know<00:06:14.720> fairly<00:06:15.380> easy<00:06:15.740> I<00:06:16.100> really

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
that it's you know fairly easy I really

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.920 
that it's you know fairly easy I really
like<00:06:16.490> doing<00:06:16.640> it<00:06:16.850> and<00:06:17.000> it<00:06:17.090> turns<00:06:17.600> out<00:06:17.720> pretty
