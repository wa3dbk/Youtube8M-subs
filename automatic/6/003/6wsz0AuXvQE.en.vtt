00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.200
 this humor off Thursday for a new 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 video that is this time it be 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.980
 the episode become a dedicated legend 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 today at least one sheet which 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
 is a single shotgun manufactured 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 by jack hobbs 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.730
 like all the men of jacobs he is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 available only in neutral damage 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 the best profit qs famous tunes but 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 wrist prefix which increases 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 damage to a little bit the shooting shot the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.210
 pressure makes a little bit imprecise a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 versatile type prefix and the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.510
 particularity of this harmonic is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 that in addition to doing neutral damage 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 as they are displayed 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.690
 it offers an explosive damage bonus there 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.400
 is very handy with the harpsichord 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.840
 specialized in explosions for 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.120
 find and weapons you will have to go to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.720
 the lunar launching station that we 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 unlock during the main quest 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.620
 at the launch station 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.970
 lunar you this pony right here at 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 level of the toll station is clear 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.340
 and right next there is the red quest 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.200
 then dead who is there that is necessary to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.649
 getting tears 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.069
 so the particularity of the earlier the goal 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.579
 of the quest is to kill messages 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.380
 edi perreon who was this point 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.780
 archived evidence that will be used to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.630
 send back the beautiful jake besides 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:39.090
 the second message and killed little vaulted the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.090
 shield the shooting star this is a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 shield type mail is an excellent 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.529
 shield in my opinion the first assassin 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.529
 of hyperlinks finally the first message and 

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:54.299
 is right next to the spawn 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.310
 we will find him justice he is 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.439
 recognizable through his armor 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.439
 red he wanted a very message 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.789
 right after you will have to kill one the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.780
 second message and hyper ion that is going 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.879
 can just 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.590
 as for him having a very very shield 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.849
 powerful, we will have to wait for 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.150
 assets if you are not enough 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.650
 damage to kill him and once 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.000
 that it will be disabled you will do 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.170
 enough damage to kill him 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.599
 by the way it's this episode without this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.739
 video date from the second day of the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.120
 exit of the game what makes you with 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.560
 my little claptrap at level 20 which 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.390
 so does the gameplay is not yet 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.700
 super done but a small museum since I 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.130
 did not know by heart the game is 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.380
 so we have to finish the quest for 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.579
 disgust locon tears that I you 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.630
 recommend to train to have the 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.340
 prefix transfer ie 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.489
 when you're at the report and well 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.799
 you simply have to leave 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.140
 and save and then decelerate 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.640
 relation to a power if you get to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 the burst tears with the prefix rustler 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.840
 it is also very powerful with 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.489
 precisely an amplifier shield 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.150
 as you know so past as he 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:19.200
 there is no the bay or the be like and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:22.510
 so it's still rather average end 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.549
 damage offered by the type shields 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.480
 amplifier remains average but it's a 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.340
 really high performance milk 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.200
 peculiarity also is that these 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.849
 balls do like the tijd the wave 2 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.560
 borderlands 1 and 2 borderlands 2 they 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.349
 do a little bit of waves 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.760
 so they are slow enough our party 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.510
 the amount of basle does that precisely 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040
 there really is really this damage what 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.709
 there is really enough ammo 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.030
 despite the swings for one shot of 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.250
 enemies as you see by browsing 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.989
 more easily one shot the enemies in 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.840
 course also though in the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.130
 park in 3 this is no longer walsh table 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.900
 unfortunately he good it stays 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.040
 really a very good shotgun that 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.239
 I recommend you for my part with 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.590
 claptrap because it's really a 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.780
 weapon in quotation marks finally needed 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.160
 not necessary but which is boosted by 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.450
 the competence dakhla physical evidence 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.579
 in the explosions I already made a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.689
 video presentation of my skills of 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.590
 my club except specialized in 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.840
 explosions 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.820
 level 50 crimes 60 games you 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.989
 they will do but I will not go 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.120
 to hide that right now I have a little bit 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.370
 the laziness of playing I love I do not play 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.710
 almost no longer so there currently my 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.510
 character higher the level 50 and a 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.979
 common sense to tell you that for the 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.449
 now I do not necessarily more plays 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.840
 edge of an ulm in general to video games 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.669
 is there I do not play too much but this 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.790
 which prevents me from playing precisely 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.660
 can make videos 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.580
 so that's all for the video or 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.320
 always I sincerely hope she 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.699
 we will be more concerned to have your opinion 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.440
 in the comments what are you 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.229
 think of this weapon have you leave 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.710
 gmt with what character do you find it 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.450
 the find you useful is also that 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.610
 did you think of your 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.850
 new year what do you have and 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.110

 See you soon for the next 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.750
