00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 after the discovery of the new greenhouse 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.030
 is a five-door cardiac you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.120
 present today the declination 3 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.120
 doors 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 no aesthetic change at the level 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 from the front and back between the two 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.040
 greenhouse bodies is a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.350
 the main difference is about 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.420
 adoption on this 3-door version of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.680
 door larger than a long but 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.629
 Above all, it is abandonment in the entourage 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.460
 of witte way of a coupe we will note 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.980
 also at the rear that the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.809
 windows can have a chrome surround 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.180
 or black as it is today 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 finally at the level of measurements sets 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 tight a three-door measure 4 meters 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.550
 in two it's about 8 cm more 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.550
 than the previous generation 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.640
 if the front seats and the board of 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.739
 edge are strictly identical to the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.940
 version 5 doors is really at 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.100
 the back that are the main 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.170
 changes in this series a three 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.119
 doors as we can see there are 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.700
 less space at the level of 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.130
 legs or the roof guard one has a 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 plus a sense of renunciation and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 Access is much more complicated 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.710
 ends with a small point concerning 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 the practical aspects with the volume of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.140
 load of 360 liters which is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.140
 rather positive 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.020
 at its launch the series a three 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 doors will be available with all 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 engines of the 5-door version 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.350
 it will also inaugurate three new 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.000
 engines first and foremost in essence a 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.160
 new entry on the 14th 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 ic develops 102 horses in the extreme 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.070
 you have the hem 135i she develops 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.810
 300 horsepower and diesel so a new 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.650
 engine am we have today the 25th 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.890
 of replacing 23 of a motor 4 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.929
 turbo twin cylinders with a power of 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.459
 218 horses so much right now 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.560
 that it is an engine that has 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.940
 a lot better because very complete 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.680
 450 newtons meters 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.230
 we immediately feel the facts of the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 turbos and the couple dia of the coupe de la 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.800
 recovery at all regimes 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.120
 really nice to use a 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.170
 little bit pushes to crime because 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.360
 respect speed limits 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.700
 with this engine it is very very difficult 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.650
 high-level consumption in 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.640
 having fun a little bit we are about 2 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.650
 7 liters to the hundred which is rather 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.290
 reasonable considering the accelerations and 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.640
 taken at the level of the behavior of 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.740
 this fraport version of the greenhouse and a 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120
 not much to say we find the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.820
 progress that has been made on the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.040
 5 door version more comfortable so 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.290
 the older generation a direction 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.000
 always still specifying always 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.580
 nice we rely on a behavior 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.290
 small cut and it corresponds well to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.560
 this 3-door version of the greenhouse is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.630
 a 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.180
 but overall no vehicle very 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.220
 satisfactory very nice especially with 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.209
 the 25 cases it is coupled to the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.209
 6-speed automatic transmission 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.219
 while retaining from this series a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.510
 three doors before they win 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.700
 a dynamism what she loses in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.709
 practicality since an effect the disappearance 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.599
 of the two back doors complicate the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.700
 daily life however a gallant 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.980
 dynamism at the level of style 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.079
 also behavior including 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.650
 with this new engine the 125 is a 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.719
 true happiness 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.939
 if you have the opportunity to buy the 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.409
 you will not regret the prices are 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.219
 relatively modeled on those of the 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.250
 5-door version 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:34.230
 they are 750 euros cheaper with a 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.569
 range between 23 1700 euros 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.569
 and 44 1850 euros 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 we
