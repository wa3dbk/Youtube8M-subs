00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.840
 new video in my unboxing chamber 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.859
 today it's about the lenovo ideapad you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.180
 the idea from about 510 and that's one 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 ultrabook of the brand was no no 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.000
 bad specifications unsure us 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.029
 see the packaging normally the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.769
 pretty typical is unspectacular 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.910
 also rather unimportant this packaging 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'll start again when I here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.700
 still explain 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 Here you can see, for example, that there is one 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.680
 eight gigabytes of RAM has one 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 a terabyte hdd disk four and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 plus 24 gb ssd and that's just it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 if equipped with windows 8 is a 15 6 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.300
 hd led display has these days in my 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.289
 opinion of standards at relatively good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.359
 computers 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:07.530
 Here we have the lines guarantee 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.939
 certificates on vienna boxes 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.689
 another little box this little one 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.320
 Box includes a power cable 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:24.450
 mains adapter man the power cable with the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.140
 Computer can connect an adapter where 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 one can see one on the left side of the page 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.570
 on dvi or av you can the micro usb 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.750
 you can include with other 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.549
 connect monitor with other fans 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.140
 because this mother Brooke 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.630
 meanwhile they are so thin 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.810
 i believe at 2.1 centimeters that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 they do not plug in so well with dvi anymore 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.080
 can be equipped because the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:59.020
 growth for these computers 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:00.700
 we pack all this time we 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.510
 let's see a page there we already 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.280
 that lenovo included a pure one here 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.420
 which is not bad at all 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 is a small ramparts against 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.360
 claudia sprits protection against water 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.370
 however we do it 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.460
 really nice all year long 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.150
 looks good is a magnesium 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.780
 aluminum housing here we still see it 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.280
 some plastic with installed 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.570
 from the bottom also already kept chic 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 really because looks good for us and 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.200
 fan since it is indicated again that 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.580
 it's just my windows 8 ultrabook 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 You can tell that it is relatively cool 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.450
 because of this aluminum magnesium housing 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.180
 then you can get here on the left 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.060
 we have the lan connection once 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.160
 there is this connection from me 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.850
 just talked where to get the monitors 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.280
 can infect the dvi adapter 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.160
 besides we have a normal one 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.930
 hdmi port a usb 3.0 port where 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.290
 but you still infected with 2.0 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.830
 Can a 3.5 millimeter jack connection 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.890
 for headphones and microphone is here too 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.750
 pictured with that as you can see because 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.170
 she will not be the little point 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.120
 probably also another one 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.410
 his microphone 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.840
 From the front you do not see anything special 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.010
 that I still charge the battery 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.380
 or as the standby indicator on the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.190
 right side we have here again 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.110
 a usb still 2 x 22 x usb 2.0 then here 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.489
 a card slot was an adapter here 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.650
 dennis quaid came out and in again 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.060
 I think all the usual sdxc cards 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.220
 can be put in there then 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.300
 here we have a dvd rw drive a burner 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.300
 drive 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.320
 what a pity I find an optical 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.120
 dvd-drive would of course have these 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.700
 thin design still much fancier 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.080
 but you can not see anything 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.990
 then of course we have here 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.740
 still the current from the connector 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:18.590
 not good for electricity not special 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:21.220
 untypical protective film for the display 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.750
 and for the keyboard 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.590
 Here we are up here up here 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.560
 turn on the power button if here 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.930
 you can see the 510 of the nova again 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.410
 font with the above you can see at the moment 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.640
 for you not so well visible the above 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.700
 number travel exactly how to get it now 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.810
 It looks like this is here 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.970
 camera what i believe a resolution of 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.550
 1.3 megapixel hears like for example 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.980
 skype or any other 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.580
 Facts practically besides it again 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.350
 a light sensor and certainly a whole 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.290
 normal keyboard and relatively good 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.330
 pressure point feels only a small 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:08.000
 bit spongy but the trackpad is 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.850
 okay left mouse button right 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.650
 mouse button fills up so well 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.510
 I do not know now if that will make a 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.050
 glass is and any other 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.350
 but material when it was all so bad 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.880
 I just know the battery power honestly 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.290
 I do not have to realize that she is 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.950
 can see anywhere how many 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.330
 milliampere but I think that was 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.630
 not specified here 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.830
 In any case, this notebook 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.850
 optionally with 175 processor 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.410
 I have now a one terabyte 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.450
 hard disk installed just the eight 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.040
 gigabyte of RAM still a 24 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.740
 abs sd memory card is the graphics card 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.210
 a gigabyte a video plus again 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.070
 an onboard graphics card 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.020
 there you can as I have noticed 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.500
 You can always switch back and forth 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.780
 choose battery power is those 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.669
 I have a normal case with normal 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.169
 use about four hours so it 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.740
 is always stated higher as it is 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.740
 actually is 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.760
 to say that everything is cool 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.830
 otherwise this baby is a whole 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.280
 normal under pressure a normal one 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.620
 portable computer for the price 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.900
 is ok for 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.880
 That's the power of this money 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.060
 do not get upset 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.980
 So I hope that I have someone 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.790
 could help with this video for his 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:37.380
 decision and said thank you and 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.380
 Until next time
