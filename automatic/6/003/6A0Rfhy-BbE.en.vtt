00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
it I think that Christianity in religion
in<00:01:19.110> general<00:01:19.140> people<00:01:19.979> don't<00:01:20.250> convert<00:01:20.610> to

them and through that by gradually

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.460 
them and through that by gradually
converting<00:01:48.329> people<00:01:48.509> instead<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.290> saying
