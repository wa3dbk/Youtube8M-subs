00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.210
 Hello Frost was fine yesterday four try with you today, 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.050
 Technology is. 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.560
 Rotary drilling as skiing yes you have control radeunga this purpose in context 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.669
 I would like to try one of these, so I can ride a variety of techniques to suit the slope situation. 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:27.020
 So I figured out five things yesterday. 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:29.689
 The first is the face lid technology that you first learn basically 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.380
 I'm pushing the scale and burning . 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:38.149
 Top-pie slide letter A technique that returns the top of the ski and the tee simultaneously 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.900
 The third one is the third one. 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:47.090
 Techniques that make the same use of mutual children but not down-up 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:51.110
 And the fourth is not it have made the body almost Date mere physical axis 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.820
 Then naturally a mere preparation for something that can take advantage of any appeal 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.470
 Technology and the fifth is that the ski is not going to be a slide, 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.879
 I can arrange it so that I can better explain the explanation more quickly 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.990
 If I demonstrate these five techniques once and for all, 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.649
 I'll try it. 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.400
 These technologies are so varied that you need to 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.659
 I will use it once before the body . 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.930
 I'll basically just do an athletic slide . 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.430
 It 's a technique of straightening the tee of a costume ambassador ski. 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.450
 So while deseo is a particularly good fit now back off back pain nadugo destroy 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.860
 As skiing is made with resistance 2 , especially when the lg is used and the direction changes, 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 Such a technique calm 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.330
 The second tower face ride In the wide state, the top of the ski and the taen 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.790
 Did so at the same time, it turns into the tower inside the days open to the outside 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.360
 Cheonan is the technology as it moves . 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.350
 Yes, so now we have that kind of technology . How about bending? 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.130
 Here's where the top face is up here and if you sit down and give it 4 more 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.060
 If you think you've heard the skill , you'll wake up while sitting here. 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.119
 The body center is almost constant in height because it makes a turn while standing up 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.200
 I feel like I'm going to make a proverbial turn . 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:08.479
 Then the ride on the body axis was like skiing here. 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.099
 The body is made to move a little dated, as the tail moves me to have a word skills 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.730
 What kind of technology would it be? 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:18.319
 After that , the fifth in the last , Carving here Skill like this side 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.069
 Rather than returning , I set up the edge with lg, and Ski cuts the explanation 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.389
 If so do you like to go earlier I was going to have to turn directly to the skills 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.659
 Now when we think time is the processor lg ski skiing can enter themselves 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:33.109
 Let's try these five techniques that will make 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.700
 Let's go down the screen and try it once. 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.680
 Please follow me. 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.780
 Now, 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.939
 By default, by default, your body is the most basic basic flu shot 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.329
 So you can make a 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:51.469
 The Tate live in this way euroyo Here you'll see once felt resistance 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:55.310
 Like this, he pushes the sheep's heel outward in this state 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:59.329
 When I got up to while making the ski protesters to turn to turn any 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 You're going to make a posture. You go out like this and push your heel out. 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:06.079
 Now is not it then the next top face in any case, while up in the state 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.469
 How about skiing and moving at the same time ? 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:14.180
 At the same time, while skiing down, 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:16.549
 When you call, once inside the wider interior, 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.030
 It's just outside . 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.139
 Would you like to bend your legs in a state 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.290
 He's going to give it back. 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:31.099
 Then, how about body weights at the body axis at a mountainous state 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:35.629
 I'm going to give it a try . 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:39.409
 Here are carving skis that did gather in this state 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.010
 Pressing outwards makes me feel inward. Go inward and slightly slope inward. 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.049
 That's it. 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.919
 These are gathered picked the look of five Takeda So what one feels is looking yoge 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.250
 Now we 've done three U-plug fires . 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:56.959
 I do not want to use this as a base, but we do not 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.720
 The physical body is doing or the direction changed or tilted outwards or friendship center 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.799
 There was also nothing but the first thing that you guys were doing right now is 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.879
 Walking to the operation control to control this skill as it once did directly 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:12.470
 Or agonists are believed to m where ah turn back while Dad skills 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:16.519
 Do you use the p boot to twist the thigh arch inward, or 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.419
 I do not want to be in the same situation as before. 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.229
 It's night. 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:24.650
 I do not know if I have the skill to build up the mystery, 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:28.159
 I made it so that I could try to sleep . 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.210
 I've used it, so let's basically use it as a relief. 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:35.870
 If you are now in your own hands, what do you need? 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:40.219
 Just before Joe was catered to return the skill now but better this skin 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:44.570
 In order to turn, the body is cushioned with some solid appearance. 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:46.699
 Go up the operation that is needed to create an action from the Action Now View Flu 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.300
 Let's make it look natural and natural. 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.300
 4 I 'll go up
