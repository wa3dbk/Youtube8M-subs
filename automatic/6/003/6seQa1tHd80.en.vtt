 hi this is online gsm and i'm jack james 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380
 despite the fact that this smartphone has 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.899
 title is the letter s without any 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.180
 digital marking however he is clearly 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.790
 recalls the flagship of 2012 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.579
 samsung galaxy s3 however his name is 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 somewhat different galaxy s duos 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 and in his pocket you guessed it 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.100
 exactly the slot for two sim cards 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 dvuhsimochny galaxy absolute copy with 3 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.629
 the difference is only in the size of the case completely 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.489
 plastic and unlike expensive 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.620
 galaxy s3 is not glossy here 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 a matte plastic so the back panel 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.659
 more hardy she doesn’t scratch give in 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.210
 hands feel nicer sizes 121 on 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.590
 120 grams main part of the front panel 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.020
 reserved for the size tft-display 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.799
 480 points 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 glass scratch steady and sufficient 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.850
 solid under it is one 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 hardware key home 2 touch 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 menu and back stuffing galaxy s duos not 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.030
 qualcomm msm 7227 most powerful processor 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.070
 with a frequency of 1 gigahertz and 768 megabytes 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 RAM in addition to them 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 4 gigabytes of built-in and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.180
 slot for micro sd memory card 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.470
 up to 32 gigabytes if you load the smartphone 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
 a large number at the same time 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.149
 running applications slowdowns 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.130
 hardly notice the smartphone is installed 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.049
 operating system android 4 0 with 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 The latest version of touchwiz is the same 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.670
 shell used in samsung galaxy 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.210
 s3 is displayed on the lock screen 4 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.880
 shortcut 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.530
 information about missed events total 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.049
 we have seven desktops 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 their number can be reduced to 1 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.310
 technical scrolling widget set 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.989
 very good for installing sim cards not 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.330
 need to pull out the battery though 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.460
 I still have to restart the smartphone 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.530
 slot sim 1 is placed above sim2 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.840
 the physical layout of the cards is not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 makes no difference in this model 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.200
 used the same concept as in 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.670
 samsung galaxy s duos 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.220
 that is, despite one radio module 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.170
 it’s still possible to use both 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.850
 sim cards for talking by 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.350
 special function in the dispatcher menu 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.110
 SIM cards can be configured forwarding 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.090
 right on the phone so talking on 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.040
 You can receive one SIM card at the same time. 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.930
 calls that are addressed to the second 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.590
 this opportunity no one else 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.840
 offers 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.630
 and this is a big plus samsung products 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.830
 the camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.380
 take pictures with a resolution of 2592 by 1944 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 photos are good but not very good 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.380
 good mediocre still not enough records 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.360
 hd video all that is 640 by 480 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.060
 front camera has a traditional 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.440
 resolution in 0 3 megapixels as a rule 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.110
 two strong and have powerful batteries 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.330
 samsung s duos did not become an exception 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.980
 its battery capacity is one and a half thousand 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.430
 milliampere hours and so samsung galaxy s 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.200
 duos 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.280
 wonderful dvuhsimnik smartphone with 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.440
 bright and high-quality display 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.790
 proven design and good 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.070
 processor besides with two 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.380
 SIM cards with the function of forwarding all 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.510
 high level competitor in the form of htc 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.160
 desire kind of slowly moving away to the second 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.019
 place but to each his own 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.920
 do not go on other sites and thawed 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.920
