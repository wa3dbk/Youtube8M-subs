exercise<00:03:36.250> for<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> right<00:03:36.940> hand<00:03:37.209> picking<00:03:37.480> now

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
exercise for the right hand picking now

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.990 
exercise for the right hand picking now
the<00:03:38.740> most<00:03:38.920> important<00:03:39.459> thing<00:03:39.490> with<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.850> is

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
the most important thing with this is

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.940 
the most important thing with this is
that<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.300> remains<00:03:40.660> alternate<00:03:41.350> picking<00:03:41.620> all

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
that it remains alternate picking all

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.830 
that it remains alternate picking all
the<00:03:42.010> time<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:42.640> you'll<00:03:42.850> always<00:03:43.120> be<00:03:43.450> picking

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
the time so you'll always be picking

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.870 
the time so you'll always be picking
down<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.709> then<00:03:44.830> up<00:03:44.980> down<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.459> then<00:03:45.550> up<00:03:45.700> we're

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
down and then up down and then up we're

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.790 
down and then up down and then up we're
never<00:03:46.060> going<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.300> do<00:03:46.480> two<00:03:46.750> strokes<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.680> the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
never going to do two strokes in the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.580 
never going to do two strokes in the
same<00:03:48.010> direction<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:49.570> we'd<00:03:49.959> start<00:03:50.230> off<00:03:50.350> with<00:03:50.500> it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
same direction so we'd start off with it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:05.790 
same direction so we'd start off with it
down<00:03:50.800> Oh

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.960 

so<00:04:06.800> they're<00:04:06.950> finishing<00:04:07.250> with<00:04:07.489> an<00:04:07.610> upstroke

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
so they're finishing with an upstroke

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:22.740 
so they're finishing with an upstroke
there<00:04:08.209> make<00:04:08.840> sure<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.200> get<00:04:09.319> that<00:04:09.500> consistent

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.240 

okay<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.169> now<00:04:24.260> here<00:04:24.470> we<00:04:24.560> are<00:04:24.590> going<00:04:24.889> back<00:04:25.070> up

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
okay and now here we are going back up

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:38.400 
okay and now here we are going back up
again<00:04:25.460> we're<00:04:25.580> going<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.760> start<00:04:25.850> with<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.270> down

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.960 

you<00:04:39.410> try<00:04:39.650> not<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:40.040> miss<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.340> strings<00:04:40.639> like<00:04:40.820> I

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
you try not to miss the strings like I

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:49.270 
you try not to miss the strings like I
just<00:04:41.030> hit<00:04:41.300> but<00:04:41.510> anyway<00:04:47.800> one<00:04:48.800> thing<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.100> find

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
just hit but anyway one thing I find

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.770 
just hit but anyway one thing I find
really<00:04:49.430> helpful<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.270> right<00:04:50.419> hand<00:04:50.660> is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
really helpful for the right hand is

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.360 
really helpful for the right hand is
using<00:04:51.050> an<00:04:51.139> anchor<00:04:51.380> just<00:04:51.830> having<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.190> little

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
using an anchor just having a little

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.650 
using an anchor just having a little
finger<00:04:52.580> touching<00:04:53.090> down<00:04:53.270> there

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
finger touching down there

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.360 
finger touching down there
and<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.110> gives<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> way<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:54.650> judging<00:04:55.070> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
and it gives you a way of judging the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.850 
and it gives you a way of judging the
distances<00:04:55.940> between<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.540> notes<00:04:56.690> again

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.070 

so<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.160> hope<00:05:03.730> you've<00:05:03.910> got<00:05:04.330> all<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.690> that<00:05:04.810> stuff

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
so I hope you've got all of that stuff

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.110 
so I hope you've got all of that stuff
down<00:05:05.380> one<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.520> things<00:05:06.700> that's<00:05:06.820> most

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
down one of the things that's most

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.820 
down one of the things that's most
important<00:05:07.690> with<00:05:07.780> this<00:05:07.870> exercise<00:05:08.200> is<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.650> you

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
important with this exercise is that you

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.560 
important with this exercise is that you
start<00:05:09.310> doing<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.700> really<00:05:09.970> really<00:05:10.180> really

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
start doing it really really really

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.170 
start doing it really really really
really<00:05:11.350> slowly<00:05:11.620> don't<00:05:12.340> try<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.670> do<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:12.910> fast

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
really slowly don't try and do it fast

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.700 
really slowly don't try and do it fast
you'll<00:05:13.390> just<00:05:13.570> develop<00:05:13.930> bad<00:05:14.110> habits<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:14.620> bad

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
you'll just develop bad habits and bad

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.310 
you'll just develop bad habits and bad
techniques<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.760> definitely<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.690> idea<00:05:17.050> is<00:05:17.170> to

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
techniques so definitely the idea is to

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:25.650 
techniques so definitely the idea is to
start<00:05:17.590> really<00:05:18.280> slow<00:05:18.400> like<00:05:23.310> or<00:05:24.310> slower<00:05:24.730> it<00:05:25.480> can

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
start really slow like or slower it can

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.450 
start really slow like or slower it can
be<00:05:25.780> quite<00:05:26.050> helpful<00:05:26.350> to<00:05:26.560> start<00:05:26.830> with<00:05:27.100> just<00:05:27.340> the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
be quite helpful to start with just the

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.520 
be quite helpful to start with just the
left<00:05:27.640> hand<00:05:27.910> do<00:05:28.210> all<00:05:28.480> down<00:05:28.720> picks<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.200> start<00:05:29.440> off

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
left hand do all down picks to start off

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.830 
left hand do all down picks to start off
with<00:05:29.740> just<00:05:30.400> get<00:05:30.610> used<00:05:30.850> to<00:05:31.000> what<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.420> left<00:05:31.630> hand

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
with just get used to what the left hand

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.990 
with just get used to what the left hand
has<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.170> do<00:05:32.320> first<00:05:32.680> once<00:05:33.460> you've<00:05:33.640> got<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:33.940> a

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
has to do first once you've got that a

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.310 
has to do first once you've got that a
bit<00:05:34.210> automated<00:05:34.720> then<00:05:34.840> you<00:05:34.930> can<00:05:35.110> start

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
bit automated then you can start

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.540 
bit automated then you can start
thinking<00:05:35.410> about<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.010> right<00:05:36.190> hand<00:05:36.370> and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
thinking about the right hand and

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.860 
thinking about the right hand and
applying<00:05:36.880> all<00:05:37.030> of<00:05:37.150> that<00:05:37.270> alternate<00:05:37.660> picking

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
applying all of that alternate picking

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.970 
applying all of that alternate picking
and<00:05:38.700> yeah<00:05:39.700> but<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.030> key<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.990> do<00:05:41.140> it<00:05:41.260> slow<00:05:41.530> it

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
and yeah but the key is to do it slow it

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.230 
and yeah but the key is to do it slow it
goes<00:05:42.190> for<00:05:42.400> pretty<00:05:42.550> much<00:05:42.700> everything<00:05:43.210> but

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
goes for pretty much everything but

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.840 
goes for pretty much everything but
particularly<00:05:43.900> with<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.110> exercise<00:05:44.850> after

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
particularly with this exercise after

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.030 
particularly with this exercise after
you've<00:05:46.210> done<00:05:46.360> that<00:05:46.420> exercises<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:47.620> first<00:05:47.890> two

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
you've done that exercises the first two

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.960 
you've done that exercises the first two
that<00:05:48.190> I've<00:05:48.280> just<00:05:48.430> shown<00:05:48.670> you<00:05:48.700> you'll<00:05:48.910> probably

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
that I've just shown you you'll probably

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.430 
that I've just shown you you'll probably
find<00:05:49.390> that<00:05:49.540> there's<00:05:49.720> another<00:05:49.870> two<00:05:50.170> on<00:05:50.350> the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
find that there's another two on the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.560 
find that there's another two on the
page<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:51.370> two<00:05:51.580> we've<00:05:51.730> done<00:05:51.970> have<00:05:52.210> got<00:05:52.390> the

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
page the two we've done have got the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.480 
page the two we've done have got the
kind<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.350> diagonal<00:05:53.890> if<00:05:54.010> you<00:05:54.130> like<00:05:54.280> going

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
kind of the diagonal if you like going

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.370 
kind of the diagonal if you like going
this<00:05:54.700> way<00:05:54.910> there's<00:05:55.480> another<00:05:55.750> two<00:05:55.990> on<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.200> same

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
this way there's another two on the same

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.260 
this way there's another two on the same
page<00:05:56.680> which<00:05:56.920> has<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.250> diagonal<00:05:57.790> going<00:05:58.000> that

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
page which has the diagonal going that

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.140 
page which has the diagonal going that
way<00:05:58.450> so<00:05:58.690> you<00:05:59.080> get

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.450 

etc<00:06:05.150> it's<00:06:06.140> exactly<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.620> same<00:06:06.770> picking

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
etc it's exactly the same picking

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.130 
etc it's exactly the same picking
process<00:06:07.910> it<00:06:08.060> just<00:06:08.240> kind<00:06:08.540> of<00:06:08.600> changes<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
process it just kind of changes the

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.170 
process it just kind of changes the
angles<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.560> you<00:06:09.620> pick<00:06:09.860> us<00:06:10.010> to<00:06:10.160> work<00:06:10.310> out<00:06:10.520> so

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
angles that you pick us to work out so

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.940 
angles that you pick us to work out so
I'd<00:06:11.600> get<00:06:11.840> into<00:06:11.990> that<00:06:12.170> second<00:06:12.590> half<00:06:12.710> though

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
I'd get into that second half though

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.250 
I'd get into that second half though
after<00:06:13.460> you've<00:06:13.550> mastered<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:14.090> first<00:06:14.300> half<00:06:14.510> so

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
after you've mastered the first half so

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.010 
after you've mastered the first half so
I<00:06:15.680> hope<00:06:16.130> that<00:06:16.160> helps<00:06:17.060> with<00:06:17.240> your<00:06:17.270> cross

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
I hope that helps with your cross

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.770 
I hope that helps with your cross
alternate<00:06:18.620> picking<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.300> I'll<00:06:20.300> see<00:06:20.660> you<00:06:20.750> for

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
alternate picking and I'll see you for

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.040 
alternate picking and I'll see you for
some<00:06:21.050> more<00:06:21.200> so<00:06:21.380> take<00:06:22.010> care
