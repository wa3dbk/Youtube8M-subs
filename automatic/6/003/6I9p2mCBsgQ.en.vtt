00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.899
 Baccarat can be a little confusing right at the beginning, but is actually one of the easiest games in the casino. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.520
 It's also one of the best games for beginners because there are no complex strategies 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.820
 and the benefits of the bank are smaller than other casino games. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.260
 Each baccarat game begins with the dealer dealing two card hands consisting of two cards. 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.940
 One of these hands is the player's hand, the other one is called the banker's hand. 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.700
 At the beginning of the round the player bets which of the two hands will win. 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.240
 The winner is determined when the hand with the complete work gets closer to the value 9. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.560
 In Baccarat the aces have the value 1, cards from 2 to 9 the displayed value and 10, Jacks, Queens and Kings the value 0. 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.720
 All results are between 0 and 9. If the result reaches 10 or more, the value of 10 is subtracted. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.040
 As an example, two seven have the value 14, which corresponds to the final value of 4. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.960
 Baccarat is such a simple game because the dealer takes over all the work and as a player you only have to bet on the hand that will probably win. 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.580
 Unlike blackjack, where you have to decide whether to match or draw another card. 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.920
 So after placing your bet and the dealer has played two cards, the value of the cards is called by the dealer. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.320
 Then Dealer plays the banker's hand. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.100
 The total of the card hand is crucial to whether more cards are drawn. 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 If the player hand is between 6 and 9 - no further card is drawn. 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.000
 If the value is equal to 8 or 9 - called the 'Natural' - the player wins immediately. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.300
 Except the bank also pulls a Natural. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.280
 If the player hand equals 5 or less, the player gets one and only one more card. 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 Whether the bank gets another card depends on the card value of the bank and the player. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.700
 The bank always fits between 7, 8 or 9 and draws a card at 0, 1 or 2. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 The rest of the rules to draw a card are a bit more complex. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.000
 But do not worry, if you play Baccarat, you only need to know how to place a bet in the beginning. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.500
 In our next baccarat video, we'll go beyond the basic rules 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.280
 to give you a secure feeling and to increase the chances that you as a winner will leave the casino. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.580
