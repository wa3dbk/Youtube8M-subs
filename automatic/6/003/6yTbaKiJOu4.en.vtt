00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
thought we were quite cool and the jump

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.350 
thought we were quite cool and the jump
wasn't<00:01:00.589> so<00:01:00.860> bad<00:01:01.010> I'm<00:01:01.640> more<00:01:01.879> worried<00:01:02.150> about<00:01:02.210> the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
wasn't so bad I'm more worried about the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.600 
wasn't so bad I'm more worried about the
hairpin<00:01:02.839> after<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.290> jump<00:01:03.500> Oh<00:01:03.829> everyone<00:01:04.580> i

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
hairpin after the jump Oh everyone i

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.310 
hairpin after the jump Oh everyone i
think<00:01:04.970> these<00:01:05.059> ways<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.690> track<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:05.990> better

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
think these ways the track is better

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.950 
think these ways the track is better
than<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:06.560> thought<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:07.369> wider<00:01:07.750> everyone<00:01:08.750> says

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
than I thought is wider everyone says

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.210 
than I thought is wider everyone says
this<00:01:09.080> quite<00:01:09.259> tired<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:09.680> it's<00:01:09.830> actually<00:01:09.979> on

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
this quite tired but it's actually on

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.300 
this quite tired but it's actually on
this<00:01:10.399> you<00:01:10.789> know<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.600> jump<00:01:11.930> side<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:12.680> tied

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
this you know the jump side that is tied

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.950 
this you know the jump side that is tied
but<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.759> rest<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.240> track<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.570> good<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.869> I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
but the rest of the track is good and I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.200 
but the rest of the track is good and I
think<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.259> good<00:01:15.440> little<00:01:15.740> lot<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.640> places<00:01:16.910> where

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
think is good little lot of places where

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.180 
think is good little lot of places where
you<00:01:17.300> can<00:01:17.479> actually<00:01:17.660> break<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.560> shell<00:01:18.890> into

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
you can actually break the shell into

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.070 
you can actually break the shell into
good<00:01:19.430> decision<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.000> over<00:01:20.240> there<00:01:20.509> sigh<00:01:20.750> I

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
good decision and over there sigh I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.050 
good decision and over there sigh I
think<00:01:21.800> they've<00:01:21.950> done<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> great<00:01:22.580> job<00:01:22.610> with<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
think they've done a great job with the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.640

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
someone right when they take off just

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.520 
someone right when they take off just
put<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.010> in<00:01:49.540> hey<00:01:50.540> just<00:01:50.780> clipped<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.290> corner

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
strategies to the jump I think if you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.190 
strategies to the jump I think if you
came<00:01:55.910> out<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.240> corner<00:01:56.540> with<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.720> dude<00:01:57.020> you

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
came out of the corner with a dude you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200 
came out of the corner with a dude you
could<00:01:57.410> both<00:01:57.560> go<00:01:57.800> off<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:58.610> pretty<00:01:58.880> narrow

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
could both go off it it's pretty narrow

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.810 
could both go off it it's pretty narrow
by<00:01:59.510> you<00:01:59.570> because<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.200> your<00:02:00.350> door<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.490> full
