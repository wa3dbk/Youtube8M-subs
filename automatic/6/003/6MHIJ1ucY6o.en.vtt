if you've been playing trials for a
while<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.500> sure<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.860> is<00:01:01.979> something<00:01:02.159> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
while I'm sure this is something you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.890 
while I'm sure this is something you
used<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.610> same<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.509> I<00:01:03.570> wanted<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
used the same but what I wanted to

used the same but what I wanted to
discuss<00:01:04.259> today<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:05.339> techniques<00:01:05.729> for

discuss today with some techniques for
minimizing<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.600> faults<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> actually

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
minimizing your faults and to actually

show<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:08.070> important<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.509> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
show you how important it is to get the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.270 
show you how important it is to get the
number<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.020> faults<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.560> before<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> ever

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
number of faults down before you ever

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
number of faults down before you ever
worry<00:01:11.580> about<00:01:11.670> how<00:01:12.240> long<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> takes<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> get

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
worry about how long it takes you to get

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
worry about how long it takes you to get
through<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> track<00:01:13.670> firstly<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.299> a

through a track firstly let's have a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
through a track firstly let's have a
look<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> impact<00:01:16.079> that<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> number<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
look at the impact that the number of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.410 
look at the impact that the number of
faults<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:18.030> leaderboard

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
faults can have on your leaderboard

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.700 
faults can have on your leaderboard

minute thirty two Ultima games was

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.630 
minute thirty two Ultima games was
faster<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.500> until<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.250> his<00:01:47.370> faults

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
faster but until he can get his faults

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.640 
faster but until he can get his faults
down<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.150> doesn't<00:01:48.360> matter<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:49.500> this

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
down it doesn't matter what this

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.560 
down it doesn't matter what this
therefore<00:01:50.070> suggests<00:01:50.580> is<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.120> every<00:01:51.360> time

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
therefore suggests is that every time

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
therefore suggests is that every time
you've<00:01:51.750> pressed<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> red<00:01:52.380> B<00:01:52.620> button<00:01:52.920> you're

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you've pressed that red B button you're

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.620 
you've pressed that red B button you're
actually<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:54.000> further<00:01:54.240> down<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually gonna be going further down the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.240 
actually gonna be going further down the
leaderboard<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:55.140> you've<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.650> make<00:01:55.799> every

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
leaderboard so you've got to make every

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.490 
leaderboard so you've got to make every
possible<00:01:56.490> effort<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.750> fault<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.440> be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
possible effort to not fault and to be

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680 
possible effort to not fault and to be
able<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> recover<00:01:59.010> from<00:01:59.340> any<00:01:59.610> situation<00:01:59.850> now

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
able to recover from any situation now

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.450 
able to recover from any situation now
for<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.930> purposes<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> lesson<00:02:01.830> I'm<00:02:02.250> not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
for the purposes of this lesson I'm not

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.440 
for the purposes of this lesson I'm not
going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.820> into<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> specifics

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
going to get into all of the specifics

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.270 
going to get into all of the specifics
about<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.229> techniques<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.979> use

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
about the techniques that you can use

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
about the techniques that you can use
what<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.700> wanted<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> show<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.690> little

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
what I wanted to show you is little

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.509 
what I wanted to show you is little
tricks<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.619> rocking<00:02:08.069> backwards<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
tricks like this rocking backwards and

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.100 
tricks like this rocking backwards and
forwards<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.299> yourself<00:02:09.659> off<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> little

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
forwards to get yourself off a little

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
forwards to get yourself off a little
ledge<00:02:10.349> being<00:02:11.099> able<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> accelerate<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.849> bit<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
ledge being able to accelerate a bit to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
move yourself off somewhere where you're

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280 
move yourself off somewhere where you're
stuck<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:15.060> know<00:02:15.090> rocking<00:02:15.569> back<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.780> forth<00:02:16.140> on

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
an absolute last resort hit the V button

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.699 
an absolute last resort hit the V button
and<00:02:32.660> accept<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.379> me<00:02:38.230> next<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.319> want<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> talk

and accept it for me next I want to talk

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.680 
and accept it for me next I want to talk
about<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.040> ramp<00:02:40.280> op<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.269> type<00:02:41.510> of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
about the ramp op this is a type of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.900 
about the ramp op this is a type of
obstacle<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.709> ramp<00:02:43.160> leading

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
obstacle that we have a ramp leading

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.180 
obstacle that we have a ramp leading
into<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.450> vertical<00:02:44.750> ledge<00:02:45.260> now<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:45.830> believe<00:02:46.099> this

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
into a vertical ledge now I believe this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
into a vertical ledge now I believe this
has<00:02:46.400> quite<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.670> specific<00:02:47.239> technique<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.959> I'm

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
has quite a specific technique and I'm

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.630 
has quite a specific technique and I'm
hoping<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.560> share<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:48.920> with<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.220> here<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
hoping to share this with you here I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.150 
hoping to share this with you here I
want<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.360> make<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.569> very<00:02:50.690> clear<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.950> very

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
want to make it very clear this is very

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.979 
want to make it very clear this is very
different<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.060> type<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.360> technique<00:02:53.840> I'm

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
different to the type of technique I'm

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.449 
different to the type of technique I'm
showing<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.319> here<00:02:54.739> where<00:02:55.220> we're<00:02:55.370> actually

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
showing you here where we're actually

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.850 
showing you here where we're actually
doing<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.120> bunnyhop<00:02:56.690> at<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.110> top<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.650> ramp

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
doing a bunnyhop at the top of a ramp

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.890 
doing a bunnyhop at the top of a ramp
the<00:02:58.580> key<00:02:58.760> thing<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.030> sets<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.540> obstacle

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the key thing that sets this obstacle

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.110 
the key thing that sets this obstacle
apart<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.040> ramp<00:03:01.310> leading<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.090> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
apart is the ramp leading you to a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.940 
apart is the ramp leading you to a
vertical<00:03:02.420> ledge<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.080> it's<00:03:03.200> very<00:03:03.440> important

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
vertical ledge and it's very important

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.770 
vertical ledge and it's very important
to<00:03:04.130> spot<00:03:04.400> them<00:03:04.610> because<00:03:04.910> you'll<00:03:05.299> approach

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
to spot them because you'll approach

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
to spot them because you'll approach
them<00:03:06.049> all<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.500> very<00:03:06.680> much<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.890> same<00:03:07.220> way<00:03:07.430> so

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
them all and very much the same way so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.729 
them all and very much the same way so
now<00:03:08.209> let's<00:03:08.420> talk<00:03:08.540> about<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.900> technique<00:03:09.290> what

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
now let's talk about the technique what

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.110 
now let's talk about the technique what
you<00:03:09.860> want<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.069> do<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.280> start<00:03:10.519> from<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.790> seated

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
you want to do is start from a seated

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120 
you want to do is start from a seated
position<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.780> start<00:03:12.260> accelerating<00:03:12.590> at<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
position and start accelerating at the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.190 
position and start accelerating at the
base<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.519> ramp<00:03:13.730> here<00:03:13.970> what<00:03:14.630> happens<00:03:15.049> is

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
base of the ramp here what happens is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.020 
base of the ramp here what happens is
that<00:03:15.380> your<00:03:15.530> front<00:03:15.799> wheel<00:03:16.040> will<00:03:16.370> actually<00:03:16.790> lift

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
that your front wheel will actually lift

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.270 
that your front wheel will actually lift
up<00:03:17.299> as<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.630> result<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> acceleration<00:03:19.099> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
up as a result of the acceleration and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.490 
up as a result of the acceleration and
the<00:03:20.000> fact<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.269> your<00:03:20.450> bodyweight<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.170> toward

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
the fact that your bodyweight is toward

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.229 
the fact that your bodyweight is toward
the<00:03:21.620> rear<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.980> bike<00:03:22.220> then<00:03:22.730> what<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.000> do<00:03:23.209> is

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
the rear of the bike then what you do is

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.880 
the rear of the bike then what you do is
lean<00:03:23.569> forward<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.290> will<00:03:24.500> allow<00:03:24.709> your

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
lean forward and this will allow your

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.680 
lean forward and this will allow your
momentum<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.579> carry<00:03:25.760> over<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.299> top<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
momentum to carry over the top of the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.960 
momentum to carry over the top of the
ramp<00:03:26.900> rather<00:03:27.440> than<00:03:27.680> having<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.040> jump<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.819> key

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
ramp rather than having to jump the key

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.220 
ramp rather than having to jump the key
thing<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.180> remember<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> stop

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
thing to remember is to stop

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.960 
thing to remember is to stop
accelerating<00:03:30.859> as<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.130> get<00:03:31.280> close<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.790> top

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
accelerating as you get close to the top

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.940 
accelerating as you get close to the top
of<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.180> ledge<00:03:32.359> if<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.019> don't<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.680> run<00:03:33.829> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
of the ledge if you don't you run the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.770 
of the ledge if you don't you run the
risk<00:03:34.069> of<00:03:34.220> your<00:03:34.340> rear<00:03:34.579> wheel<00:03:34.819> gaining<00:03:35.269> grip<00:03:35.540> on

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
risk of your rear wheel gaining grip on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.720 
risk of your rear wheel gaining grip on
the<00:03:35.930> top<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.290> ledge<00:03:36.579> accelerating<00:03:37.579> and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the top of the ledge accelerating and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.460 
the top of the ledge accelerating and
actually<00:03:38.030> flipping<00:03:38.299> your<00:03:38.420> backwards<00:03:38.870> now

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
actually flipping your backwards now

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.960 
actually flipping your backwards now
it's<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.859> matter<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.220> continuing<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.819> lean

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
it's just a matter of continuing to lean

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.250 
it's just a matter of continuing to lean
forward<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.630> your<00:03:41.810> body<00:03:41.989> weight<00:03:42.230> and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
forward and your body weight and

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.590 
forward and your body weight and
momentum<00:03:42.500> will<00:03:43.100> get<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.340> over<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.700> edge<00:03:43.730> now

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
momentum will get you over the edge now

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.849 
momentum will get you over the edge now
let's<00:03:44.780> take<00:03:44.959> another<00:03:44.989> look<00:03:45.380> at<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.650> without

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
let's take another look at this without

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.520 
let's take another look at this without
the<00:03:46.040> brakes<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.519> see<00:03:46.850> how<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.120> done

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.980 

but<00:03:51.340> here's<00:03:51.550> my<00:03:51.610> favorite<00:03:51.910> part<00:03:52.090> now<00:03:52.720> we<00:03:52.780> can

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
but here's my favorite part now we can

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.330 
but here's my favorite part now we can
actually<00:03:53.230> start<00:03:53.410> using<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.770> technique<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.310> a

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
actually start using that technique on a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.800 
actually start using that technique on a
number<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.640> other<00:03:54.819> extreme<00:03:55.300> tricks<00:03:55.600> that<00:03:55.750> you

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
number of other extreme tricks that you

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.449 
number of other extreme tricks that you
might<00:03:55.959> not<00:03:56.110> have<00:03:56.200> even<00:03:56.260> thought<00:03:56.440> about<00:03:56.709> here's

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
might not have even thought about here's

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.190 
might not have even thought about here's
an<00:03:57.580> example<00:03:57.880> on<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.240> wreck<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.690> even<00:03:59.110> though

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
an example on the wreck and even though

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.449 
an example on the wreck and even though
that<00:03:59.319> was<00:03:59.440> quite<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.650> short<00:03:59.860> lead<00:04:00.069> up<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.250> the

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
that was quite a short lead up to the

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.370 
that was quite a short lead up to the
jump<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.180> exact<00:04:01.480> same<00:04:01.660> technique<00:04:02.020> applied

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
jump the exact same technique applied

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.559 
jump the exact same technique applied
another<00:04:03.130> example<00:04:03.610> we've<00:04:03.700> got<00:04:03.730> here<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.330> fishey

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
another example we've got here on fishey

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.630 
another example we've got here on fishey
bizness<00:04:04.770> same<00:04:05.770> technique<00:04:06.160> even<00:04:06.280> though<00:04:06.490> there

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
bizness same technique even though there

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.160 
bizness same technique even though there
was<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.760> gap<00:04:07.030> in<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.330> ramp<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.959> same

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
was a gap in that ramp the same

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.470 
was a gap in that ramp the same
technique<00:04:08.650> will<00:04:08.860> work<00:04:09.040> perfectly<00:04:09.520> and<00:04:10.000> now

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
technique will work perfectly and now

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.820 
technique will work perfectly and now
that<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:10.720> know<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.170> technique<00:04:11.560> works

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
that we know that this technique works

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.160 
that we know that this technique works
even<00:04:12.130> when<00:04:12.489> there's<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.730> gap<00:04:12.970> in<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.300> ramp<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.780> want

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
even when there's a gap in a ramp I want

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.540 
even when there's a gap in a ramp I want
you<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.350> look<00:04:14.530> at<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.709> obstacle<00:04:15.220> here<00:04:15.400> now

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
you to look at this obstacle here now

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.699 
you to look at this obstacle here now
this<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.850> pretty<00:04:16.030> tricky<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:17.019> if<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.560> just

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
this is pretty tricky but if you just

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.170 
this is pretty tricky but if you just
use<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.889> little<00:04:18.010> bit<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.310> imagination<00:04:19.030> you'll

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
use a little bit of imagination you'll

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.879 
use a little bit of imagination you'll
start<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.620> exact<00:04:20.859> same

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
start to see that it's the exact same

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.130 
start to see that it's the exact same
obstacle<00:04:21.579> now<00:04:22.030> using<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> exact<00:04:23.050> same

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
obstacle now using the exact same

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.230 
obstacle now using the exact same
technique<00:04:23.710> when<00:04:24.340> your<00:04:24.460> body<00:04:24.700> weight<00:04:24.910> gets<00:04:25.120> to

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
technique when your body weight gets to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.970 
technique when your body weight gets to
the<00:04:25.330> top<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.660> ramp<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.960> lean<00:04:26.140> forward<00:04:26.169> you

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
the top of the ramp you lean forward you

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.100 
the top of the ramp you lean forward you
clear<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.340> jump<00:04:27.550> quite<00:04:27.730> easily<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.720> may<00:04:28.960> not

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
clear the jump quite easily it may not

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.050 
clear the jump quite easily it may not
look<00:04:29.290> like<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.560> but<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.370> same<00:04:30.580> jump<00:04:30.820> and

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
look like it but it is the same jump and

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.220 
look like it but it is the same jump and
now<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.540> know<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.870> you'll<00:04:32.200> be

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
now that you know this you'll be

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.420 
now that you know this you'll be
completing<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:32.830> with<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.070> lot<00:04:33.280> more

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
completing this with a lot more

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.590 
completing this with a lot more
consistency<00:04:39.120> now<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.270> we're<00:04:40.390> halfway

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
consistency now that we're halfway

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.360 
consistency now that we're halfway
through<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.110> first<00:04:41.320> semester<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.919> thought<00:04:42.280> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
through the first semester I thought it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.530 
through the first semester I thought it
was<00:04:42.460> appropriate<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:43.000> we<00:04:43.150> take<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.360> little

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
was appropriate that we take a little

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.150 
was appropriate that we take a little
bit<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.780> time<00:04:44.020> just<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.350> start<00:04:44.620> thinking<00:04:44.919> about

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
bit of time just to start thinking about

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.710 
bit of time just to start thinking about
the<00:04:45.250> overall<00:04:45.340> philosophy<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.570> way<00:04:46.660> you

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
the overall philosophy and the way you

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.690 
the overall philosophy and the way you
should<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:46.960> approaching<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.590> track<00:04:47.860> we've<00:04:48.520> been

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
should be approaching a track we've been

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.920 
should be approaching a track we've been
going<00:04:48.880> through<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.120> number<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.479> lessons

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
going through a number of lessons

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.719 
going through a number of lessons
teaching<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.380> individual<00:04:50.889> techniques<00:04:51.340> and

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
teaching you individual techniques and

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.280 
teaching you individual techniques and
what<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:51.910> want<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.300> teach<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.600> now<00:04:52.840> is

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
what I want you to teach you now is

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.840 
what I want you to teach you now is
about<00:04:53.650> how<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.860> make<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.100> particular<00:04:54.610> track

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
about how to make a particular track

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.090 
about how to make a particular track
easy<00:04:55.090> now<00:04:55.570> dark<00:04:55.810> city<00:04:56.020> run<00:04:56.290> is<00:04:56.500> not<00:04:56.830> an<00:04:56.979> easy

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
easy now dark city run is not an easy

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.290 
easy now dark city run is not an easy
track<00:04:57.400> by<00:04:57.580> any<00:04:57.729> stretch<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.180> imagination

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
track by any stretch of the imagination

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.210 
track by any stretch of the imagination
but<00:04:59.169> with<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.350> few<00:04:59.530> other<00:04:59.680> techniques<00:05:00.100> that

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
but with a few other techniques that

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.680 
but with a few other techniques that
we've<00:05:00.340> taught<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.580> we<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.300> actually<00:05:01.540> make

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
we've taught you we can actually make

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.960 
we've taught you we can actually make
this<00:05:01.840> track<00:05:02.140> quite<00:05:02.500> simple<00:05:02.890> the<00:05:03.400> key<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:03.820> to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
this track quite simple the key is to

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.730 
this track quite simple the key is to
break<00:05:04.150> down<00:05:04.300> each<00:05:04.479> obstacle<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.200> think<00:05:05.530> about

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
break down each obstacle and think about

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.320 
break down each obstacle and think about
it<00:05:05.890> as<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.160> applies<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.490> previous<00:05:07.000> lessons

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
it as it applies to previous lessons

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.700 
it as it applies to previous lessons
that<00:05:07.390> we've<00:05:07.539> provided<00:05:07.690> now<00:05:08.260> if<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.440> look<00:05:08.590> at

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
that we've provided now if I look at

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.650 
that we've provided now if I look at
this<00:05:08.770> obstacle<00:05:09.130> right<00:05:09.370> here<00:05:09.700> I'm<00:05:10.180> going<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.570> go

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
this obstacle right here I'm going to go

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.600 
this obstacle right here I'm going to go
back<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.110> lesson<00:05:11.260> 3<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:11.979> have<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.310> think<00:05:12.550> about

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
back to lesson 3 and have a think about

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.520 
back to lesson 3 and have a think about
the<00:05:12.940> uphill<00:05:13.270> transitions<00:05:13.840> lesson<00:05:14.229> that<00:05:14.440> we

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
the uphill transitions lesson that we

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.590 
the uphill transitions lesson that we
talked<00:05:14.770> about<00:05:14.890> what<00:05:15.640> we<00:05:15.729> should<00:05:15.760> be<00:05:15.940> doing<00:05:16.030> is

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
talked about what we should be doing is

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.210 
talked about what we should be doing is
sitting<00:05:16.900> down<00:05:17.169> on<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.380> bike<00:05:17.590> lifting<00:05:18.130> the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
sitting down on the bike lifting the

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.890 
sitting down on the bike lifting the
front<00:05:18.340> wheel<00:05:18.580> up<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:18.940> then<00:05:19.390> accelerating

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
front wheel up and then accelerating

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.570 
front wheel up and then accelerating
gently<00:05:20.289> up<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.530> slope<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.010> that's<00:05:21.280> exactly

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
gently up the slope and that's exactly

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.710 
gently up the slope and that's exactly
what<00:05:21.850> we're<00:05:21.940> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.120> do<00:05:22.270> here

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
what we're going to do here

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.450 
what we're going to do here
the<00:05:23.410> second<00:05:23.740> thing<00:05:23.890> now<00:05:24.010> I'm<00:05:24.130> going<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.340> look

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
the second thing now I'm going to look

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.040 
the second thing now I'm going to look
at<00:05:24.580> this<00:05:24.700> and<00:05:24.880> think<00:05:25.000> well<00:05:25.240> that's<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.870> bunny

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
at this and think well that's a bunny

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.469 
at this and think well that's a bunny
hop<00:05:26.260> from<00:05:26.860> lesson<00:05:27.160> 1<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.940> I'm<00:05:28.030> going<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> start

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
hop from lesson 1 so I'm going to start

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.240 
hop from lesson 1 so I'm going to start
taking<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:28.900> as<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> bunny<00:05:29.350> hop<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:29.830> looking

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
taking this as a bunny hop and looking

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.890 
taking this as a bunny hop and looking
across<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.669> other<00:05:30.760> side<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:31.450> realize<00:05:31.750> that

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
across the other side to realize that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.659 
across the other side to realize that
there's<00:05:32.080> also<00:05:32.200> a<00:05:32.620> landing<00:05:33.220> on<00:05:33.340> an<00:05:33.430> uphill

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
there's also a landing on an uphill

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.820 
there's also a landing on an uphill
slope<00:05:33.910> which<00:05:34.479> is<00:05:34.630> also<00:05:34.810> covered<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.410> less<00:05:35.710> than

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
slope which is also covered in less than

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.279 
slope which is also covered in less than
three<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:37.390> finally<00:05:37.870> you're<00:05:38.110> going<00:05:38.200> to

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
three and finally you're going to

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.110 
three and finally you're going to
recognize<00:05:38.560> this<00:05:38.830> obstacle<00:05:39.190> that's<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.789> ramp<00:05:39.970> up

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
recognize this obstacle that's a ramp up

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.790 
recognize this obstacle that's a ramp up
and<00:05:40.330> we've<00:05:40.419> just<00:05:40.450> gone<00:05:40.840> over<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.229> tutorial

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
and we've just gone over that tutorial

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.000 
and we've just gone over that tutorial
as<00:05:41.950> I<00:05:42.220> just<00:05:42.370> explained<00:05:42.789> sit<00:05:43.360> back<00:05:43.510> on<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.750> bike

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
as I just explained sit back on the bike

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.260 
as I just explained sit back on the bike
accelerate<00:05:45.010> lifting<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.700> front<00:05:45.910> wheel<00:05:46.060> up

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
accelerate lifting the front wheel up

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.790 
accelerate lifting the front wheel up
and<00:05:46.419> then<00:05:46.810> allowing<00:05:47.020> your<00:05:47.229> body<00:05:47.320> weight<00:05:47.620> to

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
and then allowing your body weight to

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.430 
and then allowing your body weight to
carry<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.130> over<00:05:48.600> now<00:05:49.600> I'm<00:05:49.750> not<00:05:49.930> going<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:50.289> go

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
carry you over now I'm not going to go

through the entire track today I know

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.790 
through the entire track today I know
there's<00:05:52.660> a<00:05:52.720> couple<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:53.020> obstacles<00:05:53.229> ahead<00:05:53.680> of

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
reason that I often suggest that new
