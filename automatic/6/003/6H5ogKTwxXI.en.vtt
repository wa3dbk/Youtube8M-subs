 dried tomato crushed finally the people 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 and the tomato purÃ©e he welcomes as 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.670
 the little camalon wood had done 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.379
 previously already done in the street we 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.260
 gives recipes so quietly the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.690
 7.7 the merck bank in slats way is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 simply chicken breast of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.510
 chicken breast then the strange of good 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 for the back for tired cars 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 the Marseillais and among them the what 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 kill the room room is beautiful 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.850
 so you take a little bit of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.800
 preparation of dried tomatoes that you have 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.780
 rolled like that must you were the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.770
 magalhaÃ¨s settings on the galettes 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.180
 be careful not to put too close to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.409
 town that after against it will roll if 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.420
 we do not give him too much the master 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.180
 because after not how 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.970
 the trend has doubled that's exactly 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.420
 absolutely it's true that after all 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.390
 you just take a blank all my 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.509
 musicians like these and there you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.649
 add duboc m 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.619
 it does not take too much when I have one 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:45.659
 little too much not too much in May ok 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.990
 beneficial once that's good 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.470
 just show it will come 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.569
 rolling you want to palaver to 0 in this 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:03.659
 sense another in his alone to hold without 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:06.659
 this suspense because if we had 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.080
 not had to manage edges of the nive in 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.670
 effect you will need typical hockey 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.750
 by little pimples good I had no 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.500
 so I took this but if we have 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.709
 small wooden picks attack like those 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 here and after you come cut out by 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.070
 against once I was playing with this 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.750
 we do we need a knife that 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.910
 cut very well really well what 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.430
 otherwise it was wasted for the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.150
 cook here and after you chained I 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 am a little tadam 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.700
 and chained am a little bit late finally 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.990
 little space and the last one 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.990
 second son points early and that's it 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.730
 keep his accounts I eat nobody 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.290

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.470
 make small rolls like that you ok 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.900
