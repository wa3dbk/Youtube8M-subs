00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
Mac but it is close to the cheapest the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
Mac but it is close to the cheapest the
least<00:00:56.250> expensive<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> $4.99<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> put

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
least expensive is $4.99 now if you put

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
least expensive is $4.99 now if you put
that<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.859> perspective<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.579> iPhone<00:00:59.910> 6<00:01:00.300> off

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
contract or unlocked is 650 is the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
contract or unlocked is 650 is the
cheapest<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.339> too<00:01:05.549> bad<00:01:05.580> seeing<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
cheapest one so not too bad seeing that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
cheapest one so not too bad seeing that
you're<00:01:06.510> getting<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> full<00:01:06.990> computer<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you're getting a full computer here so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
you're getting a full computer here so
let's<00:01:08.280> open<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> decided<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
get this because I run an old server

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.550 
get this because I run an old server
running<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.439> old<00:01:13.729> 2006<00:01:14.729> 2007<00:01:15.509> white<00:01:16.020> iMac

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
like to have this take its place as you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.350 
like to have this take its place as you
can<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.200> there's<00:01:22.380> no<00:01:22.650> Drive<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> want

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can see there's no Drive and if you want

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
can see there's no Drive and if you want
an<00:01:24.479> extra<00:01:24.720> Drive<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> pick<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.770> for

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
an extra Drive you can pick one up for

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190 
an extra Drive you can pick one up for
about<00:01:26.130> $80<00:01:26.880> pretty<00:01:27.180> expensive<00:01:27.540> yes<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.170> are

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
about $80 pretty expensive yes there are

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
about $80 pretty expensive yes there are
third-party<00:01:28.590> ones<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.270> wanted<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
third-party ones but I just wanted it to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
third-party ones but I just wanted it to
match<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.200> pick<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.310> well<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> can

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
match so pick that up as well so you can

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
match so pick that up as well so you can
see<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> Mac<00:01:33.990> Mini<00:01:34.020> box<00:01:34.560> looks<00:01:35.009> like

to<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.130> macbook<00:01:44.759> let's<00:01:45.540> pull<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to a macbook let's pull this out here

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
to a macbook let's pull this out here
it's<00:01:47.220> an<00:01:47.340> aluminum<00:01:47.579> body<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.119> we'll<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.479> a

it's an aluminum body and we'll take a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's an aluminum body and we'll take a
look<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.110> second<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.340> we've

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
look at that in a second see what we've

but it's a one terabyte drive and for me
this<00:03:00.270> will<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.480> plenty<00:03:00.900> fast<00:03:01.110> now<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.220> side

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
this will be plenty fast now on the side

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.670 
this will be plenty fast now on the side
here<00:03:02.730> you've<00:03:02.880> got<00:03:03.030> an<00:03:03.120> IR<00:03:03.390> port<00:03:03.720> you've<00:03:04.410> got

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
here you've got an IR port you've got

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.430 
here you've got an IR port you've got
what<00:03:05.070> looks<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.400> be<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> microphone<00:03:06.440> nothing

around the side nothing on either side

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.140 
around the side nothing on either side
and<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.350> you've<00:03:10.530> got<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.890> area<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.850> a

this<00:03:32.190> has<00:03:32.400> Wireless<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.320> BGN<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.650> AC<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.400> it's

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
this has Wireless a BGN and AC so it's

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.220 
this has Wireless a BGN and AC so it's
got<00:03:35.670> all<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.030> different<00:03:36.060> Woerner<00:03:36.630> list<00:03:36.840> bands

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
got all the different Woerner list bands

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.259 
got all the different Woerner list bands
so<00:03:37.709> I'm<00:03:37.769> going<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:37.980> hook<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.640> start<00:03:39.150> it

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
so I'm going to hook it up and start it

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.509 
so I'm going to hook it up and start it
up<00:03:39.330> for<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.630> first<00:03:39.780> time<00:03:39.980> now<00:03:40.980> before<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> turn

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
up for the first time now before I turn

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.310 
up for the first time now before I turn
this<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.060> I'm<00:03:42.300> obviously<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.080> need<00:03:43.290> a

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
this on I'm obviously going to need a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.050 
this on I'm obviously going to need a
keyboard<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.860> mouse<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.400> I've<00:03:44.640> got<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> couple

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
use of the Mac Mini is pretty good it's

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.750 
use of the Mac Mini is pretty good it's
not<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.020> fastest<00:04:56.530> computer<00:04:57.010> but<00:04:57.160> it's<00:04:57.280> it's

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
not the fastest computer but it's it's

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.120 
not the fastest computer but it's it's
more<00:04:57.880> than<00:04:58.420> acceptable<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.440> if<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.980> had<00:05:00.100> a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
more than acceptable and if it had a

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.710 
more than acceptable and if it had a
solid-state<00:05:00.700> drive<00:05:00.970> in<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.360> would<00:05:01.540> be

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
solid-state drive in it it would be

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.070 
solid-state drive in it it would be
plenty<00:05:02.170> fast<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:03.310> 5400<00:05:04.090> rpm<00:05:04.480> one<00:05:04.690> terabyte

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
plenty fast that 5400 rpm one terabyte

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.620 
plenty fast that 5400 rpm one terabyte
drive<00:05:05.350> definitely<00:05:05.980> slows<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.520> down<00:05:06.550> some<00:05:07.060> but

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
drive definitely slows it down some but

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.570 
drive definitely slows it down some but
overall<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.170> a<00:05:08.320> great<00:05:08.560> Mac<00:05:08.950> especially

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580
