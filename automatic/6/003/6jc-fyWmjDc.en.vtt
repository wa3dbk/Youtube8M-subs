00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
spreading looks spectacular the reason

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.129 
spreading looks spectacular the reason
because<00:07:17.800> of<00:07:17.919> this<00:07:18.009> is<00:07:18.729> that<00:07:18.840> there<00:07:19.840> is<00:07:19.990> the

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
because of this is that there is the

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.710 
because of this is that there is the
border<00:07:20.470> and<00:07:20.650> it<00:07:21.400> gives<00:07:21.639> a<00:07:21.729> 3d<00:07:22.090> looks<00:07:22.300> and<00:07:22.509> kind

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
border and it gives a 3d looks and kind

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.249 
border and it gives a 3d looks and kind
of<00:07:22.780> jumps<00:07:23.020> up<00:07:23.229> of<00:07:23.380> it<00:07:23.500> but<00:07:24.430> that's<00:07:24.550> in<00:07:25.000> like<00:07:25.449> in

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
of jumps up of it but that's in like in

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.040 
of jumps up of it but that's in like in
real<00:07:26.440> life<00:07:26.560> northern<00:07:27.130> camera<00:07:27.490> but<00:07:27.699> not<00:07:28.240> sure

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
real life northern camera but not sure

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.640 
real life northern camera but not sure
if<00:07:29.169> you'll<00:07:29.289> be<00:07:29.440> able<00:07:29.530> to<00:07:29.680> see<00:07:29.889> it<00:07:29.979> on<00:07:30.099> camera<00:07:31.650> so

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650 
if you'll be able to see it on camera so

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.909 
if you'll be able to see it on camera so
it<00:07:32.680> spreads<00:07:33.099> amazing<00:07:33.699> handles<00:07:34.449> beautifully

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 
it spreads amazing handles beautifully

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:38.279 
it spreads amazing handles beautifully
so<00:07:35.919> this<00:07:36.310> is<00:07:36.340> deck<00:07:36.729> that<00:07:36.969> you<00:07:37.090> should<00:07:37.270> keep<00:07:37.479> add

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:38.289 
so this is deck that you should keep add

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:40.350 
so this is deck that you should keep add
to<00:07:38.500> your<00:07:38.620> collection<00:07:38.740> because<00:07:39.460> it<00:07:39.729> is<00:07:40.030> well

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
to your collection because it is well

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.570 
to your collection because it is well
worth<00:07:40.539> the<00:07:40.599> money<00:07:40.750> I<00:07:41.139> think<00:07:42.009> it's<00:07:42.130> about<00:07:42.219> five

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
worth the money I think it's about five
