gonna slow down how fast that pancake
becomes<00:02:44.430> sugar<00:02:44.700> okay<00:02:46.790> that's<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.910> fact<00:02:48.180> that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
becomes sugar okay that's a fact that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.900 
becomes sugar okay that's a fact that
fat<00:02:49.020> slows<00:02:49.410> down<00:02:49.680> how<00:02:49.920> fast<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.490> pancake

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
fat slows down how fast the pancake

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.330 
fat slows down how fast the pancake
becomes<00:02:51.360> sugar<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> blood<00:02:52.440> now<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
becomes sugar in the blood now that's a
