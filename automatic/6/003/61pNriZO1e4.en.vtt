00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
they don't actually have any hint of

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.930 
they don't actually have any hint of
mint<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.470> them<00:01:20.649> like<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:20.830> green<00:01:21.220> tinge<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.759> them

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
mint to them like a green tinge to them

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.510 
mint to them like a green tinge to them
at<00:01:22.180> all<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.560> do<00:01:23.740> have<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.100> say<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.310> certain

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
at all but I do have to say in certain

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.910 
at all but I do have to say in certain
lighting<00:01:24.880> they<00:01:25.149> do<00:01:25.450> tend<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.930> look<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.380> little

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
lighting they do tend to look a little

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.090 
lighting they do tend to look a little
ever<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:27.610> slightly<00:01:28.140> green<00:01:29.140> like<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.680> greeny

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
ever so slightly green like a greeny

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.540 
ever so slightly green like a greeny
blue<00:01:30.690> but<00:01:31.690> most<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.680> time<00:01:32.890> they<00:01:33.070> look<00:01:33.100> this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
blue but most of the time they look this

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.850 
blue but most of the time they look this
deep<00:01:34.119> blue<00:01:34.479> I'd<00:01:34.750> say<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.229> deep<00:01:35.470> sea<00:01:35.710> blue

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
deep blue I'd say like a deep sea blue

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.440 
deep blue I'd say like a deep sea blue
color<00:01:36.190> I'm<00:01:36.520> quite<00:01:36.729> satisfied<00:01:37.119> with<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.420> I

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
color I'm quite satisfied with it I

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.060 
color I'm quite satisfied with it I
don't<00:01:37.600> have<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.050> problem<00:01:38.200> with<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.680> knew<00:01:38.920> from

don't have a problem with it I knew from

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.340 
don't have a problem with it I knew from
the<00:01:39.250> very<00:01:39.280> start<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.960> did<00:01:41.140> some

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the very start because I did some

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.080 
the very start because I did some
research<00:01:41.770> about<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.130> color<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.670> they<00:01:42.850> would

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
research about the color that they would

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.779 
research about the color that they would
come<00:01:43.390> out<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.750> color<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.410> photo<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:45.429> lenses

about the color wheel red and green
cancel<00:02:05.229> out<00:02:05.319> each<00:02:05.470> other<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.509> find

cancel out each other and if you find

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.990 
cancel out each other and if you find
the<00:02:07.810> lenses<00:02:08.170> like<00:02:08.319> that<00:02:08.530> what<00:02:09.310> remains<00:02:09.700> is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the lenses like that what remains is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.479 
the lenses like that what remains is
majority<00:02:10.660> color<00:02:11.080> or<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.069> most<00:02:12.220> prominent

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
majority color or the most prominent

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.430 
majority color or the most prominent
color<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:13.030> should<00:02:13.180> say<00:02:13.330> which<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.930> blue<00:02:14.140> in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
color I should say which is blue in

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.050 
color I should say which is blue in
terms<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.980> how<00:02:15.160> natural<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.700> looks

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
terms of how natural it looks

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.120 
terms of how natural it looks
I<00:02:16.209> think<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:16.900> are<00:02:17.050> fairly<00:02:17.440> natural-looking

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
I think they are fairly natural-looking

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.470 
I think they are fairly natural-looking
contact<00:02:18.760> lenses

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
contact lenses

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.390 
contact lenses
and<00:02:19.720> they<00:02:19.990> are<00:02:20.140> by<00:02:20.530> far<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.890> most<00:02:20.980> natural

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and they are by far the most natural

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.210 
and they are by far the most natural
looking<00:02:21.550> contact<00:02:22.000> lenses<00:02:22.209> I've<00:02:22.390> ever<00:02:22.599> tried

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
looking contact lenses I've ever tried

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.800 
looking contact lenses I've ever tried
like<00:02:24.220> many<00:02:24.459> people<00:02:24.610> say<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.060> these<00:02:25.420> are<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
like many people say that these are the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.080 
like many people say that these are the

heading towards the people and it's less

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.710 
heading towards the people and it's less
opaque<00:02:45.010> that's<00:02:45.610> how<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.819> lenses<00:02:46.330> are

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720

if<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.989> look<00:02:59.140> at<00:02:59.230> people<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.560> never<00:02:59.769> realize

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
if you look at people with never realize

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.850 
if you look at people with never realize
eyes<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:00.549> how<00:03:00.790> their<00:03:00.940> pupils<00:03:01.330> look<00:03:01.510> like
