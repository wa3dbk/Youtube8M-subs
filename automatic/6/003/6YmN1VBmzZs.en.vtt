00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.660 
mean I wouldn't say it's working better
at<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:43.979> level<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.640> think

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
at this level actually I think

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
at this level actually I think
traditionally<00:01:45.420> historically<00:01:45.960> I've<00:01:46.470> done

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
traditionally historically I've done

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.990 
traditionally historically I've done
really<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:46.920> against<00:01:47.220> weaker<00:01:47.490> fields<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
really well against weaker fields I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
really well against weaker fields I
think<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.360> poker<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.810> has<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.170> improved<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
think my poker game has just improved a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
think my poker game has just improved a
lot<00:01:49.950> over<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.369> last<00:01:50.399> year<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.479> I've

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
lot over the last year you know I've

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
lot over the last year you know I've
been<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> pretty<00:01:52.470> hard<00:01:52.740> worker<00:01:52.950> both<00:01:53.340> off

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
been I'm a pretty hard worker both off

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.130 
been I'm a pretty hard worker both off
the<00:01:53.729> table<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> table<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.020> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the table and on the table and just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.540 
the table and on the table and just
theoretically<00:01:55.619> talking<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.189> friend

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
theoretically talking with my friend

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.370 
theoretically talking with my friend
then<00:01:56.790> I've<00:01:57.510> been<00:01:57.660> playing<00:01:57.780> poker<00:01:57.930> since<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.260> was

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
then I've been playing poker since I was

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.750 
then I've been playing poker since I was
17<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.800> don't<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.220> there's<00:01:59.370> ever<00:01:59.490> been<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
17 I don't think there's ever been a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.430 
17 I don't think there's ever been a
12-month<00:02:00.390> period<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.960> lap<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.320> I've

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
12-month period it's a lap so I've

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.780 
12-month period it's a lap so I've
improved<00:02:01.650> my<00:02:01.830> game<00:02:01.860> within<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.370> last<00:02:02.490> 12

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
improved my game within the last 12

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.820 
improved my game within the last 12
months<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.260> obviously<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.740> you're

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
months so you know obviously when you're

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.080 
months so you know obviously when you're
winning<00:02:04.980> you're<00:02:05.160> running<00:02:05.490> well<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.670> when

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
