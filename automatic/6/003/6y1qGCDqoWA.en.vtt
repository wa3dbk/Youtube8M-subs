two bathrooms in this case they have a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
two bathrooms in this case they have a
second<00:00:48.930> bathroom<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.920> they'll<00:00:50.070> keep<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.310> tub

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
like getting rid of these one is because

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.390 
like getting rid of these one is because
fiberglass<00:00:57.390> shower<00:00:58.020> enclosure<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
fiberglass shower enclosure which I

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.670 
fiberglass shower enclosure which I
can't<00:00:59.640> stand<00:00:59.970> when<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:00.900> get<00:01:01.050> stained<00:01:01.380> in<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.270 
can't stand when they get stained in the
bottom<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.490> crack<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.120> they're<00:01:03.330> done

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
shower so I'm going to end up building a

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.050 
shower so I'm going to end up building a
curb<00:01:21.270> along<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.499> and<00:01:22.649> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> five<00:01:23.700> foot

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
curb along here and this is five foot

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.940 
curb along here and this is five foot
from<00:01:24.390> side<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> side<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.679> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.859> be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
from side to side so it's going to be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.039 
from side to side so it's going to be
five<00:01:26.280> foot<00:01:26.549> by<00:01:26.579> almost<00:01:27.149> three<00:01:27.479> foot<00:01:27.749> shower

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
five foot by almost three foot shower

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.739 
five foot by almost three foot shower
which<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.159> cool<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.609> then<00:01:30.270> eventually

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
which is really cool and then eventually

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.219 
which is really cool and then eventually
some<00:01:31.259> slider<00:01:31.530> doors<00:01:31.859> will<00:01:32.249> go<00:01:32.429> here<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.659> then

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
some slider doors will go here and then

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
some slider doors will go here and then
get<00:01:34.560> rid<00:01:34.679> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> toilet<00:01:35.249> and<00:01:35.369> vanity<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.819> put

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
get rid of the toilet and vanity and put

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.910 
get rid of the toilet and vanity and put
new<00:01:36.420> toilet<00:01:36.780> vanity<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:37.499> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> be

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
new toilet vanity and that's going to be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.639 
new toilet vanity and that's going to be
smaller<00:01:38.399> hopefully<00:01:39.090> give<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.229> room<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
smaller hopefully give some more room to

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.190 
smaller hopefully give some more room to
this<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.389> don't<00:01:42.569> have<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.749> chance<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this so I don't have a chance to do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649 
this so I don't have a chance to do
these<00:01:43.380> small<00:01:43.499> showers<00:01:44.340> very<00:01:44.460> often<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
these small showers very often but I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
these small showers very often but I
like<00:01:46.020> doing<00:01:46.319> them<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.189> does

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
like doing them because it really does

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.489 
like doing them because it really does
increase<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.450> value<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> house<00:01:49.200> even

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
increase the value of the house even

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.109 
increase the value of the house even
though<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.069> this<00:01:50.219> case<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.789> retirement

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
though in this case it's a retirement

is day one and I'm going to get started
on<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> demo<00:02:12.450> which<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.290> relatively<00:02:13.799> easy<00:02:14.040> I

toilet and vanity I'll take the sticky
stuff<00:02:18.609> up<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.750> demo<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.109> pretty<00:02:20.409> easy<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
stuff up and the demo is pretty easy and

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.890 
stuff up and the demo is pretty easy and
then<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.280> started<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.849> building<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.719> real

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
then I get started on building a real

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.319 
then I get started on building a real
bathroom<00:02:23.250> okay<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> am<00:02:24.760> done<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.150> this

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
bathroom okay I am done with this

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.309 
bathroom okay I am done with this
bathroom<00:02:26.040> same<00:02:27.239> point<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.359> view<00:02:28.540> coming<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.079> I

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
bathroom same point of view coming in I

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.319 
bathroom same point of view coming in I
didn't<00:02:29.920> take<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.219> middle<00:02:30.519> part<00:02:30.730> because<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
didn't take the middle part because the

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.390 
didn't take the middle part because the
middle<00:02:31.569> part<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.959> what<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.739> actually<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.250> with

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
middle part is what I actually do with

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.479 
middle part is what I actually do with
the<00:02:33.459> build<00:02:33.930> build<00:02:34.930> up<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.189> finished

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
the build build up to the finished

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.580 
the build build up to the finished
product<00:02:36.909> and<00:02:37.030> since<00:02:37.900> I'm<00:02:37.989> not<00:02:38.079> really<00:02:38.290> trying

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
product and since I'm not really trying

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.259 
product and since I'm not really trying
to<00:02:38.650> teach<00:02:38.769> people<00:02:38.980> how<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.310> do<00:02:39.549> stuff<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.060> just

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
to teach people how to do stuff but just

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.209 
to teach people how to do stuff but just
the<00:02:40.420> difference<00:02:40.810> between<00:02:41.620> before<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.040> after

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
the difference between before and after

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.369 
the difference between before and after
that's<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.819> reason<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.209> I'm<00:02:44.079> just<00:02:44.319> doing

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
that's the reason that I'm just doing

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:52.099 
that's the reason that I'm just doing
the<00:02:44.620> after<00:02:46.739> yes<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.950> came<00:02:51.129> in<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.519> this

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the after yes so we came in with this

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.780 
the after yes so we came in with this
porcelain<00:02:53.109> tile<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.040> put<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> transition

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
porcelain tile and I put a transition

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.059 
porcelain tile and I put a transition
strip<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.389> I<00:02:55.569> think<00:02:56.109> apparently<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> customer

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
strip in I think apparently the customer

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.349 
strip in I think apparently the customer
is<00:02:57.159> going<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.340> get<00:02:57.489> some<00:02:57.669> bamboo<00:02:57.879> flooring

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
is going to get some bamboo flooring

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.390 
is going to get some bamboo flooring
which<00:02:58.989> is<00:02:59.139> usually<00:02:59.620> about<00:02:59.769> three<00:03:00.040> quarters

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
which is usually about three quarters

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.179 
which is usually about three quarters
and<00:03:00.639> that<00:03:00.700> will<00:03:01.629> be<00:03:01.810> about<00:03:02.200> flush<00:03:02.650> with<00:03:02.980> this

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
and that will be about flush with this

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.879 
and that will be about flush with this
transition<00:03:03.849> strip<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.859> know<00:03:05.980> where<00:03:06.519> we

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
transition strip you know where we

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.830 
transition strip you know where we
change<00:03:08.889> out<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.219> band

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
change out the band

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.259 
change out the band
obviously<00:03:10.840> brand<00:03:11.319> new<00:03:11.439> vanity<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.120> looks

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
obviously brand new vanity and it looks

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:13.860 
obviously brand new vanity and it looks
much<00:03:13.419> nicer

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
much nicer

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.539 
much nicer
I<00:03:14.109> guess<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.439> put<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.829> hanging<00:03:15.040> beer<00:03:15.310> here

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
I guess you put a hanging beer here

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.909 
I guess you put a hanging beer here
eventually<00:03:15.819> changed<00:03:16.719> out<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.959> toilet<00:03:17.379> brand

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959

and<00:04:20.350> do<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.590> very<00:04:20.890> quick<00:04:21.190> slope<00:04:21.580> down<00:04:21.820> there

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
and do a very quick slope down there

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.120 
and do a very quick slope down there
although<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.050> slope<00:04:23.290> isn't<00:04:23.650> really<00:04:23.890> that

although the slope isn't really that

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.270 
although the slope isn't really that
profound<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.570> enough<00:04:25.870> for<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:27.190> nice<00:04:27.370> grain

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
profound it is enough for a nice grain

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.170

it is slanted inward about 25 degrees or
so<00:04:38.940> assuming<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.090> she<00:04:40.330> gets<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.890> frameless

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
so assuming that she gets the frameless

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.860 
so assuming that she gets the frameless
door<00:04:42.520> which<00:04:42.670> everybody<00:04:43.060> likes<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.480> frameless

door which everybody likes the frameless

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.770 
door which everybody likes the frameless
door<00:04:44.080> would<00:04:44.200> go<00:04:44.320> here<00:04:44.710> about<00:04:45.370> 24<00:04:45.940> 28<00:04:46.270> inch<00:04:46.540> door

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
and then a panel over here so I always

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.050 
and then a panel over here so I always
do<00:04:50.080> those<00:04:50.320> at<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.560> slope<00:04:50.860> with<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.730> assumption

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060

always<00:04:57.190> want<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.430> slope<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.030> water<00:04:58.300> goes

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
always want that slope so the water goes

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.920 
always want that slope so the water goes
off<00:04:58.750> nicely<00:04:59.560> and<00:05:00.390> we<00:05:01.390> did<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.630> a<00:05:01.690> brick

I was able to trim out right off for the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.780 
I was able to trim out right off for the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
all the way up to ceiling and it's much

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.110 
all the way up to ceiling and it's much
better<00:05:35.260> looking<00:05:35.620> shower<00:05:35.860> than<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.310> was<00:05:36.460> before

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
better looking shower than it was before

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.990 
better looking shower than it was before
that's<00:05:37.750> for<00:05:38.050> sure<00:05:38.230> so<00:05:38.620> whether<00:05:39.520> it's<00:05:39.730> for<00:05:39.790> the

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
that's for sure so whether it's for the

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
those plastic enclosures really really

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.180 
those plastic enclosures really really
suck<00:05:46.180> I<00:05:46.360> don't<00:05:46.510> like<00:05:46.690> my<00:05:46.900> own<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.830> this<00:05:48.010> was<00:05:48.160> a
