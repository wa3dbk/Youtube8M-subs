this is a good idea then antec can see

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
this is a good idea then antec can see
that<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> might<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> good<00:01:20.280> idea<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that it might actually be a good idea to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.859 
that it might actually be a good idea to
