00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.640
 miss dior was created 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.300
 when we pay tribute 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.640
 catherine dior the darling sister of 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.770
 christian dior and I believe that tribute 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.660
 that we returned to him today was 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.290
 pretty obvious to us finally from 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.189
 to choose 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.869
 fifteen female artists visual artist 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.520
 whole world that represents 15 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.340
 different sensitivities but who have 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.310
 all finally their own 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.910
 interpretation of the codes of the best 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.329
 so they each chose a code that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.449
 it is the fragance the hound's foot 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.969
 who today defines miss dior and 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.969
 they were inspired by that for 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.340
 create their their original works that 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.530
 are white cards that lasts to 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.530
 give these artists to these creators 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.670
 Christian Dior 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.210
 artists of his time or pebbles in 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 1928 first with jacques good I have 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 then with pierre coll it's 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.580
 galleries will exist until 1933 1934 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.290
 caught up in the crisis and he is exposed to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.090
 a number of artists today 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.280
 recognized who will be present in 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.910
 the exhibition as christian bÃ©rard 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.040
 quillan of his friends who will follow him in 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.960
 his adventure until the opening of 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.390
 couture houses he has a very sure taste 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.580
 he is I think he's basically 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.140
 an artist himself who expresses 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.060
 of course through drawing and at 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.619
 through fashion but I believe it does 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.050
 part of this artist community 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.300
 who was very close to this 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.619
 artistic effervescence of the 20s 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.070
 and yes he has some is someone 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.399
 extremely sensitive to artists 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.830
 for him the arrested he has art was 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.080
 everywhere and get together everywhere and I 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.160
 think he will express his tooth in this 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.350
 perfume who finally only vote a 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.910
 amazing given that he imagines at 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.270
 very moment of opening his house of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.580
 sewing 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.970
 for him it is an extension of the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.670
 fashion and that's just as equally 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.590
 important that these parades will call him 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.569
 by the way one of his miss dior dresses 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.910
 very quickly and so where does this expression 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.270
 surrealist who has it he had exposed 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.530
 in his gallery will find himself going other 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.530
 also in fashion
