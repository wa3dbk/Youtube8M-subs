shoulder<00:00:08.730> camera<00:00:09.179> bag<00:00:10.790> so<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> bought<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.059> of

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
shoulder camera bag so I bought one of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.410 
shoulder camera bag so I bought one of
these<00:00:12.300> recently<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:14.089> couldn't<00:00:15.089> find<00:00:15.269> any

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
these recently and I couldn't find any

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.920 
these recently and I couldn't find any
reviews<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:16.020> youtube<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.910> thought<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.570> would

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
reviews on youtube so I thought I would

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.330 
reviews on youtube so I thought I would
do<00:00:19.020> more<00:00:19.199> myself<00:00:20.330> it<00:00:22.609> costs<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.850> think<00:00:24.560> $29.99<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
do more myself it costs I think $29.99 I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.870 
do more myself it costs I think $29.99 I
might<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.820> wrong<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.109> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.070> CRP

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
might be wrong on that I think that CRP

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.170 
might be wrong on that I think that CRP
but<00:00:31.369> obviously<00:00:32.369> Amazon<00:00:32.730> are<00:00:32.820> quite<00:00:33.000> often

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
but obviously Amazon are quite often

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
but obviously Amazon are quite often
doing<00:00:33.450> deals<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.680> sometimes<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.219> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
doing deals so you can sometimes get it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
doing deals so you can sometimes get it
for<00:00:35.460> cheaper<00:00:37.219> yeah<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.960> let's<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
for cheaper yeah so let's get into the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.060 
for cheaper yeah so let's get into the
bag<00:00:44.000> as<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.870> has<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.500> nice<00:00:46.710> kind

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
bag as you can see it has this nice kind

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
bag as you can see it has this nice kind
of<00:00:47.450> velcro<00:00:48.950> handle<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:51.329> connects<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.840> these

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
of velcro handle the connects if these

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.250 
of velcro handle the connects if these
two<00:00:53.930> clip<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> straps<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
two clip kind of straps and so if you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.900 
two clip kind of straps and so if you
just<00:00:58.289> unclip<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:59.039> easy<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.789> unclip<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.890> then

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
just unclip them easy to unclip and then

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.140 
just unclip them easy to unclip and then
you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> open<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.040> tend<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.780> have<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
you can open this up I tend to have this

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.399 
you can open this up I tend to have this
like<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.840> both<00:01:09.990> come<00:01:10.260> open

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
like that so that they both come open

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
like that so that they both come open
but<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.070> actually<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.170> zip<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
but there is actually then a zip it to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
but there is actually then a zip it to
zips<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.180> they<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:19.140> often<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.619> next<00:01:20.100> kind

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
zips and they can do often a next kind

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
zips and they can do often a next kind
of<00:01:20.549> level<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:22.850> safety<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> once<00:01:27.720> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of level of of safety so once you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.399 
of level of of safety so once you
actually<00:01:28.340> open<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.750> then<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.110> into

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
actually open up that then you get into

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
actually open up that then you get into
the<00:01:31.500> space<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.810> currently

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the space so the way that I currently

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.230 
the space so the way that I currently
have<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> set<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:36.380> my<00:01:37.380> flash

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
have it set up is that I have my flash

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.160 
have it set up is that I have my flash
just<00:01:39.240> resting<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.780> top<00:01:41.420> which<00:01:42.420> isn't<00:01:42.750> ideal

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
just resting on top which isn't ideal

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
just resting on top which isn't ideal
but<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> also<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> bad<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.659> happy

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but it's also not that bad so I'm happy

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.719 
but it's also not that bad so I'm happy
with<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> let's<00:01:47.850> put<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> down<00:01:48.600> there

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
with that so let's put that down there

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
with that so let's put that down there
and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.630> right<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.799> fit

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and then all right you actually can fit

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.139 
and then all right you actually can fit
quite<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.640> if<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.820> show<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
quite a lot in here so if I show you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.289 
quite a lot in here so if I show you
this<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.939> my<00:02:00.469> D<00:02:01.469> third<00:02:02.149> d7000<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this here this is my D third d7000 and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
this here this is my D third d7000 and
actually<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.680> battery<00:02:05.009> grip<00:02:05.189> on

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
actually I have got a battery grip on

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually I have got a battery grip on
the<00:02:05.399> bottom<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.469> I<00:02:07.469> can't<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.829> out

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the bottom of that and I can't get out

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040 
the bottom of that and I can't get out
at<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.129> moment<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.729> kind<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> stood

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
at the moment because I'm kind of stood

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.740 
at the moment because I'm kind of stood
behind<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.440> camera<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
behind the camera but then this is

the Sigma 14 mil 2.8 d a spherical e^x

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.920 
the Sigma 14 mil 2.8 d a spherical e^x
HSM<00:03:26.040> Sigma<00:03:27.040> lens<00:03:29.280> wide<00:03:30.280> angle<00:03:30.820> stuff<00:03:31.209> I'll

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
HSM Sigma lens wide angle stuff I'll

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.949 
HSM Sigma lens wide angle stuff I'll
just<00:03:32.140> leave<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.620> out<00:03:32.680> for<00:03:32.920> now<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.480> yes<00:03:37.750> so

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
finally I then have the classic and for

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.420 
finally I then have the classic and for
the<00:03:43.739> let<00:03:44.739> me<00:03:44.769> try<00:03:45.070> focus<00:03:45.549> up<00:03:45.700> slightly<00:03:47.220> I'm<00:03:48.220> on

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the let me try focus up slightly I'm on

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.039 
the let me try focus up slightly I'm on
I'm<00:03:48.910> on<00:03:49.120> auto<00:03:49.329> focus<00:03:49.900> awkward<00:03:51.840> okay

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
I'm on auto focus awkward okay

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:00.229 
I'm on auto focus awkward okay
yeah<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.769> Nick<00:03:53.950> on<00:03:55.410> classic<00:03:56.410> DX<00:03:56.799> 35<00:03:57.579> 1.8<00:03:58.480> and

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
yeah the Nick on classic DX 35 1.8 and

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.729 
yeah the Nick on classic DX 35 1.8 and
so<00:04:01.239> actually<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.780> fit<00:04:02.230> all<00:04:02.350> of<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.560> in

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
so actually you can fit all of this in

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.100 
so actually you can fit all of this in
there<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:04.079> then<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:06.549> do<00:04:06.700> still<00:04:07.000> have<00:04:07.030> as<00:04:07.840> if

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
there and then you do still have as if

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.470 
there and then you do still have as if
at<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.320> top<00:04:08.579> which<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:09.970> have<00:04:10.269> some

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
at the top which I just have some

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.650 
at the top which I just have some
microfiber<00:04:10.959> cloth<00:04:11.230> Center<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:12.660> quick

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
microfiber cloth Center and a quick

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.990 
microfiber cloth Center and a quick
brush<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.660> then<00:04:17.250> if<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.400> come<00:04:18.579> around<00:04:18.729> to

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
brush and then if you come around to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.030 
brush and then if you come around to
this<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.359> actually<00:04:19.780> one<00:04:20.229> thing<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.530> wouldn't<00:04:20.799> do

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
this I actually one thing I wouldn't do

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.010 
this I actually one thing I wouldn't do
want<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.250> show<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.489> first<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:22.030> all<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.840> these

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
want to show you first is all of these

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.730 
want to show you first is all of these
are<00:04:23.890> removable<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:26.260> center<00:04:26.860> point

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
are removable the center point

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.110 
are removable the center point
let<00:04:27.889> me<00:04:27.979> focus<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.460> back<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:28.850> answer<00:04:31.120> more

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
let me focus that back you answer more

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120 
let me focus that back you answer more
the<00:04:32.240> center<00:04:32.449> points<00:04:32.780> are<00:04:32.930> removable<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.039> you

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
the center points are removable and you

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.499 
the center points are removable and you
can<00:04:34.340> change<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.850> pattern<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.330> actually

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
can change the pattern but I actually

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.029 
can change the pattern but I actually
quite<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.169> way<00:04:36.259> they<00:04:36.410> originally<00:04:36.860> came

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
quite like the way they originally came

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.610 
quite like the way they originally came
and<00:04:37.880> finally<00:04:38.300> there<00:04:38.479> is<00:04:38.509> actually<00:04:39.020> although<00:04:39.500> I

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
and finally there is actually although I

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.140 
and finally there is actually although I
don't<00:04:39.800> think<00:04:40.039> I<00:04:40.280> would<00:04:40.430> use<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.789> because<00:04:41.120> I

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
don't think I would use this because I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.480 
don't think I would use this because I
have<00:04:41.360> quite<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.599> lot<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.810> stuff<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.169> there<00:04:42.490> but

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
have quite a lot of stuff in there but

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.249 
have quite a lot of stuff in there but
you<00:04:43.610> could<00:04:43.849> essentially<00:04:44.330> put<00:04:44.630> like<00:04:44.780> an<00:04:44.900> iPad

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
you could essentially put like an iPad

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.040 
you could essentially put like an iPad
or<00:04:45.440> pudding<00:04:45.800> mini<00:04:45.949> iPad<00:04:46.280> sorry<00:04:46.720> I'm<00:04:47.720> not<00:04:47.870> sure

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
or pudding mini iPad sorry I'm not sure

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.480 
or pudding mini iPad sorry I'm not sure
how<00:04:48.199> big<00:04:48.349> an<00:04:48.470> iPad<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:48.949> but<00:04:49.099> I<00:04:49.160> think<00:04:49.370> it's

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
how big an iPad is but I think it's

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.210 
how big an iPad is but I think it's
probably<00:04:49.639> big<00:04:49.940> enough<00:04:50.240> or<00:04:50.419> other<00:04:50.690> tablet<00:04:53.169> so

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
probably big enough or other tablet so

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.180 
probably big enough or other tablet so
if<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.430> actually<00:04:56.560> wanted<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.680> could<00:04:57.889> put<00:04:58.099> my

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
if I actually wanted I could put my

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.480 
if I actually wanted I could put my
NVIDIA<00:05:01.190> Tegra<00:05:01.370> note<00:05:01.940> 7<00:05:02.150> whatever<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.490> and

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
NVIDIA Tegra note 7 whatever it is and

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.219 
NVIDIA Tegra note 7 whatever it is and
then<00:05:04.669> you<00:05:04.820> do<00:05:04.970> have<00:05:05.000> some<00:05:05.180> extra<00:05:05.449> pockets<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.169> I

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
then you do have some extra pockets so I

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.050 
then you do have some extra pockets so I
have<00:05:06.410> some<00:05:06.590> stuff<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.860> do<00:05:07.099> with<00:05:07.220> my<00:05:07.340> flash<00:05:07.610> and

a flash diffuser for the pop-up flash in

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.930 
a flash diffuser for the pop-up flash in
there<00:05:13.270> there's<00:05:14.270> then<00:05:14.599> a<00:05:14.630> front<00:05:14.960> pocket<00:05:18.940> which

some flak trigger there it's overall I

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:24.410 
some flak trigger there it's overall I
think<00:06:17.940> this<00:06:18.690> is<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:20.870> pretty<00:06:21.870> good<00:06:22.080> bag<00:06:23.360> for<00:06:24.360> the

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
price you pay I think it's definitely

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
come quickly because it's Amazon and

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.350 
come quickly because it's Amazon and
also<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:41.190> thing<00:06:41.400> that's<00:06:41.580> quite<00:06:41.760> good<00:06:42.060> is<00:06:42.210> it

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
also the thing that's quite good is it

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.030 
also the thing that's quite good is it
is<00:06:42.510> it<00:06:42.660> does<00:06:42.840> stay<00:06:43.050> upright<00:06:43.200> when<00:06:43.710> you<00:06:43.830> use<00:06:44.010> a

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
is it does stay upright when you use a

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.840 
is it does stay upright when you use a
strap<00:06:45.110> and<00:06:46.110> also<00:06:46.410> what<00:06:46.950> I<00:06:46.980> found<00:06:47.250> is<00:06:47.490> you<00:06:47.520> can

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
strap and also what I found is you can

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.620 
strap and also what I found is you can
if<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:48.870> actually<00:06:49.050> fold<00:06:49.530> this<00:06:49.770> inside<00:06:50.310> out

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
if you actually fold this inside out

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:56.570 
if you actually fold this inside out
then<00:06:51.630> you<00:06:51.840> can<00:06:51.990> put<00:06:52.230> this<00:06:52.760> if<00:06:53.760> I<00:06:53.910> just<00:06:55.310> you<00:06:56.310> fold

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
then you can put this if I just you fold

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.450 
then you can put this if I just you fold
this<00:06:56.760> and<00:06:57.000> inside<00:06:57.540> out<00:06:57.800> then<00:06:58.800> hopefully<00:06:59.370> you

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
this and inside out then hopefully you

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.220 
this and inside out then hopefully you
can<00:06:59.580> see<00:06:59.790> this<00:06:59.940> way<00:07:00.890> then<00:07:01.890> you<00:07:02.370> can<00:07:03.120> put<00:07:04.110> it

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
can see this way then you can put it

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.920 
can see this way then you can put it
underneath<00:07:04.500> and<00:07:05.070> actually<00:07:05.520> then<00:07:06.510> that<00:07:06.720> means

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
underneath and actually then that means

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.170 
underneath and actually then that means
you<00:07:07.110> can<00:07:07.350> essentially<00:07:08.310> have<00:07:08.430> your<00:07:08.669> body<00:07:08.850> there

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
you can essentially have your body there

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.890 
you can essentially have your body there
and<00:07:09.450> you<00:07:09.750> can<00:07:09.900> just<00:07:10.050> grab<00:07:10.169> dip<00:07:10.740> in<00:07:11.750> when<00:07:12.750> you're

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
and you can just grab dip in when you're

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.590 
and you can just grab dip in when you're
out<00:07:13.020> so<00:07:14.870> overall<00:07:15.870> a<00:07:16.169> very<00:07:16.260> useful<00:07:17.190> bag<00:07:18.150> that

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
out so overall a very useful bag that

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.490 
out so overall a very useful bag that
can<00:07:18.720> actually<00:07:18.900> fit<00:07:19.290> quite<00:07:19.440> a<00:07:19.560> lot<00:07:19.740> in<00:07:21.500> I'd

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500
