00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
there now you can tamp that force

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:57.600 
there now you can tamp that force
beautiful<00:01:41.560> that's<00:01:42.560> okay<00:01:43.540> tamson<00:01:44.540> awesome

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and that's going to brace it against the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.110 
and that's going to brace it against the
wire<00:02:08.630> stretching<00:02:09.290> this<00:02:09.470> way<00:02:09.740> Oh

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120

our<00:02:15.560> mirror<00:02:15.800> around<00:02:27.040> maybe<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.190> good<00:02:28.430> sensible

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
our mirror around maybe a good sensible

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.850 
our mirror around maybe a good sensible
deal<00:02:29.300> would<00:02:29.510> be<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.780> start<00:02:30.080> by<00:02:30.320> just<00:02:30.350> putting<00:02:30.709> a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
deal would be to start by just putting a

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.170 
deal would be to start by just putting a
staple<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.400> down<00:02:31.700> low<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.270> suggest<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:35.090> don't

this<00:02:38.360> takes<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.660> lot<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.840> angle<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.350> leave<00:02:39.500> it

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
this takes a lot of angle and leave it

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.100 
this takes a lot of angle and leave it
leave<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> little<00:02:40.250> bit<00:02:40.489> loose<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.480> all<00:02:41.840> its

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
leave a little bit loose so all its

angle as quick as you can that way it's

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.460 
angle as quick as you can that way it's
a<00:02:54.620> lot<00:02:54.739> less<00:02:54.980> likely<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.489> loosen<00:02:55.970> up<00:02:56.470> rather

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
a lot less likely to loosen up rather

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:13.539 
a lot less likely to loosen up rather
than<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:59.540> know<00:02:59.660> run<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.170> along<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.769> wire

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.759 

better<00:03:14.549> with<00:03:14.760> gloves<00:03:15.170> okay<00:03:16.170> another<00:03:16.409> trick

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.690 
wrapped up you can just flip it up here
and<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:36.930> not<00:03:37.079> going<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.409> wine<00:03:38.689> okay<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:41.069> if

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
and it's not going on wine okay so if

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.759 
and it's not going on wine okay so if
you<00:03:41.879> get<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.180> about<00:03:42.420> here<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.290> want<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.739> a

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
you get it about here you want to be a

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.119 
you get it about here you want to be a
little<00:03:44.010> ways<00:03:44.250> away<00:03:44.489> from<00:03:44.849> either<00:03:45.000> end<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.599> think

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
little ways away from either end I think

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.339 
little ways away from either end I think
but<00:03:47.129> kind<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.519> wrap<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.510> yeah<00:03:48.900> after

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
but kind of wrap it so that yeah after

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.910 
but kind of wrap it so that yeah after
you<00:03:49.379> you<00:03:50.069> might<00:03:50.310> have<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.299> know<00:03:51.709> weave<00:03:52.709> it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
you you might have to you know weave it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:01.740 
you you might have to you know weave it
back<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:53.430> forth<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.940> get<00:03:54.090> by

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.620 

the<00:04:02.290> idea<00:04:02.860> what<00:04:03.100> I'm<00:04:03.190> getting<00:04:03.370> at<00:04:03.610> is<00:04:03.640> once<00:04:04.420> we

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
the idea what I'm getting at is once we

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.520 
the idea what I'm getting at is once we
get<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.930> wrapped<00:04:05.230> up<00:04:05.530> pretty<00:04:05.830> good<00:04:07.320> then<00:04:08.320> we

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
get it wrapped up pretty good then we

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.620 
get it wrapped up pretty good then we
can<00:04:08.740> swing<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.340> over<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.150> not<00:04:10.360> going<00:04:10.570> to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
can swing it over and it's not going to

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.330 
can swing it over and it's not going to
come<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:10.960> round<00:04:11.230> its<00:04:11.800> going<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.010> butt<00:04:12.310> up

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
come on round its going to butt up

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.560 
come on round its going to butt up
against<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:14.140> brace<00:04:14.560> post<00:04:14.920> here<00:04:15.280> all<00:04:16.269> we

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
against this this brace post here all we

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.870 
against this this brace post here all we
want<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.840> do<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.320> brace<00:04:17.650> this<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.280> as<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.609> put

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
want to do is brace this so as we put

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.759 
want to do is brace this so as we put
tension<00:04:19.150> on<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.840> one<00:04:20.140> we'll<00:04:20.290> stretch<00:04:20.560> the

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
tension on it with one we'll stretch the

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.340 
tension on it with one we'll stretch the
wire<00:04:21.210> that<00:04:22.210> it's<00:04:22.420> coming<00:04:22.900> up<00:04:23.020> against

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
wire that it's coming up against

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.900 
wire that it's coming up against
something<00:04:23.620> solid<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.310> it's<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.490> going<00:04:24.820> to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
something solid and it's not going to

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.790 
something solid and it's not going to
move<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.570> we're<00:04:25.930> not<00:04:26.080> going<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.260> end<00:04:26.470> up<00:04:26.620> with

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
move not we're not going to end up with

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.580 
move not we're not going to end up with
a<00:04:26.860> post<00:04:27.220> that's<00:04:27.780> leaning<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:28.930> here<00:04:29.260> over<00:04:29.470> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
a post that's leaning in here over the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.290 
a post that's leaning in here over the
years<00:04:29.620> back<00:04:30.310> that's<00:04:31.270> what<00:04:31.510> we<00:04:31.630> want<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:33.300> that's

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
years back that's what we want so that's

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.110 
years back that's what we want so that's
probably<00:04:34.690> fine
