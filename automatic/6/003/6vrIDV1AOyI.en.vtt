00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.640 
because the anime came after i suppose
they<00:06:26.660> couldn't<00:06:26.930> do<00:06:27.050> everything<00:06:27.440> that<00:06:27.530> the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
they couldn't do everything that the

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.360 
they couldn't do everything that the
animated<00:06:28.630> but<00:06:29.630> it's<00:06:30.560> good<00:06:30.860> for<00:06:31.039> what<00:06:31.130> it<00:06:31.160> is

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370

see<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:33.949> anime<00:06:34.250> i<00:06:34.280> probably<00:06:34.490> would<00:06:34.669> have

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
see the anime i probably would have

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.100
