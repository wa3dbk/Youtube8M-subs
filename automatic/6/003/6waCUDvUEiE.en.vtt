you have someone actually working on the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.310 
you have someone actually working on the
top<00:03:07.400> as<00:03:08.330> well<00:03:08.570> as<00:03:08.720> some<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.020> working<00:03:09.230> on

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
top as well as some of the working on

top as well as some of the working on
the<00:03:09.410> bottom<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.950> two<00:03:10.100> post<00:03:10.310> lift<00:03:10.400> really

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
the bottom so the two post lift really

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.640 
the bottom so the two post lift really
isn't<00:03:10.970> helping<00:03:11.030> us<00:03:11.300> too<00:03:11.450> much<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:12.410> had<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
isn't helping us too much we had to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.200 
isn't helping us too much we had to
unbolt<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.100> tourney<00:03:13.310> crossmember<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.120> we

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
unbolt the tourney crossmember so we

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.760 
unbolt the tourney crossmember so we
could<00:03:14.390> kind<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.600> shift<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.020> engine<00:03:15.350> back<00:03:15.500> and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
could kind of shift the engine back and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.920 
could kind of shift the engine back and
forth<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.910> shifted<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.420> engine<00:03:17.690> toward

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
forth so we shifted the engine toward

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.560 
forth so we shifted the engine toward
the<00:03:17.990> driver's<00:03:18.320> side<00:03:18.500> we've<00:03:18.800> got<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
the driver's side we've got the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.520 
the driver's side we've got the
passenger-side<00:03:20.570> header<00:03:20.780> end<00:03:21.170> we're<00:03:21.350> going<00:03:21.440> to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
passenger-side header end we're going to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
passenger-side header end we're going to
move<00:03:21.620> over<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.890> other<00:03:22.010> side<00:03:22.100> right<00:03:22.430> now

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.310 

it<00:03:25.550> just<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:25.910> happens<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.690> Kooks<00:03:27.050> header

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
it just so happens that the Kooks header

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.170 
it just so happens that the Kooks header
is<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:27.770> in<00:03:27.860> opposite<00:03:28.520> directions<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:29.060> this

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
is going in opposite directions on this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.030 
is going in opposite directions on this
trail<00:03:29.390> blazer<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:30.380> put<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.650> in<00:03:30.740> from<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.010> top

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
trail blazer we put it in from the top

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.710 
trail blazer we put it in from the top
on<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.610> passenger<00:03:32.000> side<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.450> on<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
on the passenger side but on the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.450 
on the passenger side but on the
driver's<00:03:33.290> side<00:03:33.320> it's<00:03:33.620> easiest<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.040> sneak<00:03:34.310> in

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
driver's side it's easiest to sneak in

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.460 
driver's side it's easiest to sneak in
and<00:03:34.550> up<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.850> body<00:03:41.110> all<00:03:42.110> right<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.350> we<00:03:42.440> got

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
and up to the body all right so we got

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.860 
and up to the body all right so we got
the<00:03:42.740> headers<00:03:43.250> all<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:43.880> next<00:03:44.600> thing<00:03:44.720> we're

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
the headers all in and next thing we're

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750 
the headers all in and next thing we're
about<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.110> put<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.260> y-pipe<00:03:45.650> just<00:03:46.460> following

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
about to put the y-pipe just following

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.100 
about to put the y-pipe just following
cooks<00:03:46.970> instructions<00:03:47.540> tell<00:03:47.750> us<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.960> go<00:03:48.050> ahead

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
cooks instructions tell us to go ahead

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.080 
cooks instructions tell us to go ahead
and<00:03:48.290> put<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.470> o2<00:03:48.710> sensor<00:03:48.740> into<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.460> passenger

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
and put the o2 sensor into the passenger

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.180 
and put the o2 sensor into the passenger
side<00:03:50.270> y<00:03:50.480> pipe<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:51.590> very<00:03:51.770> difficult<00:03:51.980> to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
side y pipe it's very difficult to

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.650 
side y pipe it's very difficult to
access<00:03:52.400> once<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.910> gets<00:03:53.030> in<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.150> car<00:03:53.330> so<00:03:53.540> we're

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
access once it gets in the car so we're

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.180 
going to go ahead and put the o2 sensor
in<00:03:55.970> there<00:03:56.090> before<00:03:56.270> we<00:03:56.450> built<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.720> up<00:03:56.810> all<00:04:03.190> right

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
in there before we built it up all right

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.440

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
straight through design you can see it

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.010 
straight through design you can see it
was<00:04:31.400> always<00:04:31.550> straight<00:04:32.000> through<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:32.780> there's

professional high performance part put
together<00:06:06.140> we<00:06:06.920> want<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.220> get<00:06:07.310> this<00:06:07.430> thing<00:06:07.490> back

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
together we want to get this thing back

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.340 
together we want to get this thing back
down<00:06:08.060> on<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.270> ground<00:06:08.450> both<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.930> wheels<00:06:09.110> on

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
down on the ground both the wheels on

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
drive it around run it through a heat

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.600 
drive it around run it through a heat
cycle<00:06:11.870> heat<00:06:12.410> out<00:06:12.590> all<00:06:12.800> these<00:06:12.980> components<00:06:13.550> that

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
cycle heat out all these components that

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.700 
cycle heat out all these components that
we've<00:06:13.730> just<00:06:13.760> installed<00:06:14.090> up<00:06:14.540> then<00:06:15.140> set<00:06:15.470> it<00:06:15.500> and

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
we've just installed up then set it and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.410 
we've just installed up then set it and
let<00:06:16.040> them<00:06:16.160> cool<00:06:16.340> down<00:06:16.400> we'll<00:06:17.180> give<00:06:17.360> them

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.420 
let them cool down we'll give them

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.030 
let them cool down we'll give them
another<00:06:17.660> torque<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:18.200> then<00:06:18.650> we'll<00:06:18.770> throw<00:06:18.920> it

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
another torque and then we'll throw it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.500 
another torque and then we'll throw it
on<00:06:19.130> dyno<00:06:19.400> and<00:06:19.520> check<00:06:19.790> out<00:06:19.910> what<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.210> numbers

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
on dyno and check out what the numbers

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.129 
on dyno and check out what the numbers
are

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139
