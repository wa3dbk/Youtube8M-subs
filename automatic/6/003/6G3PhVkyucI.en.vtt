 passed the day our pink salmon is ready 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.050
 look before serving 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.410
 if you serve it exactly 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.470
 take it in pieces so that it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.260
 was not very salty and if you will 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.870
 make a sandwich then take it 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.930
 but she is with butter and and a bar she is not 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.420
 before making sandwiches put 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.480
 for a few minutes you can even an hour 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.480
 freezer then your fish will be easier 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.360
