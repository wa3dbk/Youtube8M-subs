00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and the cheapest electricity me 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.290
 it seems good it is not convenient how much we 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.179
 will go out of light good idea not by 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.610
 Now I'm not in agreement and it's more 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.920
 we know nothing since August this 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.289
 year the Ecuadorian families will have the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 alternative to change your gas stoves 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.270
 by electric induction cookers in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.420
 the citizenship there are several questions 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 about what they are and how it works 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 induction cooker use primarily 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 because it seems a bit dangerous the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.640
 most deficient kitchens that exist in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
 today are the letter kitchens 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 of induction that its principle of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.190
 operation is through a field 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.989
 magnetic induction cookers 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 they work through fields 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.579
 electromagnetic that react with the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 metal cooking utensils 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 Heat from the pot or pan is transferred 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 to the food inside and the process 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.329
 cook says the experts is more effective 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.020
 and sure gas or cooking stoves 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.730
 conventional electric david chÃ¡vez 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.500
 representative of hong vega believes that a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 of the main advantages of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 induction cookers is safety 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.540
 they have automatic shutdown systems 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510
 they have there 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.490
 of control or blocking anti children 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.440
 avoid being lit by one of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 The main characteristics of these 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.910
 kitchens is that if we put our hands on 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.730
 the burner when it is on 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.070
 we do not burn ourselves since the heat that 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.170
 generates the kitchen alone is captured by 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 special metals such as iron or 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.690
 Reinforced steel security is a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 advantage but for others it is efficiency 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.000
 of these kitchens what makes them 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.800
 preferable to gas cooker me 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 better way is more efficient is more 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.580
 fast spends much less energy three 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.560
 times less energy 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.570
 to check the effectiveness of these 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.630
 appliances we did a test 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.340
 simple boil water let's take the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.380
 Story time is slow to boil 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 a liter of water in a kitchen 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 induction 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.560
 the test is performed at the height of 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.060
 the city of quito is to say 2800 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 meters above sea level 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.110
 the liter of water delayed in boiling 2 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.090
 minutes with 15 seconds now let's 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.209
 do the same test but in a kitchen 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.209
 gas 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.890
 in the kitchen gives the water was delayed in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.950
 boil 10 minutes with 30 seconds is 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.740
 say the same liter of water boiled 8 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.870
 minutes with 15 seconds faster in 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.390
 an induction cooker that in a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.910
 gas cooking so you can say 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.459
 that the induction cooker is faster 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 it saves us time we also have to avoid 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.330
 do not forget things and that we 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.850
 burning of course is a change too 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.800
 of the general criteria we had for 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.930
 do things however many are 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.060
 they ask if any pot or pan 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.730
 It can be used in the kitchens of 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.620
 induction I bought pot and they say that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.019
 that pot is no longer going to be worth to cook 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.209
 in induction we must do it with pots and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.780
 pans that have an iron base or 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.940
 steel that is pure aluminum can not 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 activate the induction plates what 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.780
 makes the difference is that just 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.180
 this base has to have a content 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.430
 of iron so that the moment when what 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.489
 we settled as I said in the burner 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.709
 the magnetic field is so efficient that 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.420
 be very quick to cook it out and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.250
 characteristics should have these 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.170
 utensils and what I have to do to 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.420
 buy them correctly as 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.879
 we check that a magnet works 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.430
 hit one and it is well stuck is very 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.069
 efficient if you have a magnet and the magnet is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.400
 slips slightly that means that the 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.980
 base has very very little iron and it's not going to 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.959
 be efficient the next step is 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.900
 verify that the base of the pot is 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.870
 flat even if the magnet sticks we're going to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.720
 have loss in the magnetic field we 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.359
 it has to be flat so there's a 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.340
 perfect magnetic field but you know 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.560
 that the aluminum pots that you already 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.169
 owns can be adapted to 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.090
 work in induction cookers alirio 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.030
 rose bushes is today's maker of 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.560
 aluminum 20 years ago and assures us that 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.500
 there is a way to continue using 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.000
 this type of utensils simply because 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.609
 adapting by making an adaptation of a 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.359
 induction disk here in the equator not 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.919
 We are manufacturers of stainless steel 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.070
 us todays manufacturers and 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.140
 aluminum 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.150
 we are embedding the disk so that 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.030
 be functional that is to say a pot of 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.680
 aluminum I can adapt this album 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.050
 and it will work for me in the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.390
 kitchens and rations the advantage of 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.640
 this type of pots according to alirio is in 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.710
 its cost a pot of servers some 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.050
 three times more expensive than the pot 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.730
 aluminum if you have a pot or 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.610
 pan in which you want to continue 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.860
 cooking has two options the first 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.440
 is to adapt a steel disk to your 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.120
 base this will allow you to cook so much 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.030
 in the induction cookers as in the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.340
 of gas the other option is to acquire a 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.400
 steel plate on which you put 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.470
 on it any type of utensil 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.870
 the cooking in this type of pots would be 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.030
 less effective as those consulted as 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.120
 which makes that when you cook 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.440
 consume more energy to market 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.080
 but they are very simple plates 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.600
 will cost 56 dollars nothing more then 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.940
 They serve as an adapter to use 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.950
 special pots but the recommended 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.070
 if this is to use the ones that the express pots 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.270
 or magnetic and have iron in their 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.400
 construction but 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.710
 cost these kitchens I have the 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.990
 they exist when you are going to pay for light 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.330
 every month and what plans the government offers 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.220
 to finance the do not miss the 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.570
 Next of this series is next 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.570
 week on television
