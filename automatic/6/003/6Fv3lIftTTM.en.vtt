00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
really good setup and then it's like if

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.930 
really good setup and then it's like if
you<00:00:13.860> break<00:00:14.040> their<00:00:14.190> setup<00:00:14.490> though<00:00:14.610> they<00:00:14.759> auto

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
you break their setup though they auto

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
you break their setup though they auto
lose<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:16.170> basically<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> want<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> talk<00:00:16.980> about

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
obviously the dinosaurs there that are

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.460 
obviously the dinosaurs there that are
the<00:00:23.010> key<00:00:23.910> cards<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> make<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.720> deck<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the key cards that make this deck you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.450 
the key cards that make this deck you
know<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> very<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.609> turn<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:28.460> basically

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
know a very good first turn so basically

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
for loggia for most general people will

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.680 
for loggia for most general people will
just<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.880> logic<00:00:36.329> first<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
just go for like logic first for the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.660 
just go for like logic first for the
lodges<00:00:36.960> maybe<00:00:37.230> set<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.710> two<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> back

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
in a very bad situation because we're

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.570 
in a very bad situation because we're

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
then like two times they do get the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
then like two times they do get the
rabbit<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.090> take

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rabbit but you can kind of like take

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
rabbit but you can kind of like take
advantage<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.100> good<00:01:23.250> card

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
advantage of that but a really good card

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
advantage of that but a really good card
Maxie<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.170> stopping<00:01:25.460> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
Maxie because that will be stopping you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.359 
Maxie because that will be stopping you
know<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.409> card<00:01:28.650> advantage<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
know the the card advantage game that

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.800 
know the the card advantage game that
they'll<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.610> getting<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:29.970> essentially

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
they'll be getting because essentially

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.370 
they'll be getting because essentially
logica<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.799> an<00:01:32.040> auto<00:01:32.400> plus<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.380> because

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
logica is an auto plus one and because

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
logica is an auto plus one and because
you<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.710> can't<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.040> anything<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.909> uh

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you know they can't get anything but uh

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660

discarding but uh once Excellency's have
don't<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.360> level<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.840> won't<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.079> really

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
don't have a level you won't be really

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.020 
don't have a level you won't be really
doing<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.650> anyways<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.579> yeah<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.910> just

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
doing that anyways but yeah you just

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.430 
doing that anyways but yeah you just
drop<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.360> true<00:03:06.540> godia<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.019> then<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.319> like

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
drop the true godia and then just like

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.860 
drop the true godia and then just like
attack<00:03:07.739> everything<00:03:08.299> because<00:03:09.299> usually<00:03:09.480> like

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
attack everything because usually like

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.539 
attack everything because usually like
if<00:03:10.049> they<00:03:10.470> want<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.650> compulsive<00:03:11.160> that's<00:03:11.310> fine

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
if they want to compulsive that's fine

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.949 
if they want to compulsive that's fine
like<00:03:11.819> they<00:03:11.970> won't<00:03:12.150> do<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.299> they're<00:03:12.810> pretty

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
like they won't do that they're pretty

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.240 
like they won't do that they're pretty
much<00:03:13.079> gonna<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.680> wait<00:03:13.860> for<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.220> a

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
much gonna have to wait for like a

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.550 
much gonna have to wait for like a
smashing<00:03:14.849> or<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.690> maybe<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:15.989> double<00:03:16.380> Lance

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
smashing or like maybe like double Lance

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.039 
smashing or like maybe like double Lance
just<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.950> get<00:03:17.130> over<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.269> double<00:03:18.720> Lance<00:03:18.870> would

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
just to get over but double Lance would

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.680 
just to get over but double Lance would
kind<00:03:19.319> of<00:03:19.350> not<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:20.040> realistic<00:03:20.609> because<00:03:20.760> it

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
kind of not be realistic because it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.080 
kind of not be realistic because it
wouldn't<00:03:22.019> quite<00:03:22.170> work<00:03:22.230> but<00:03:23.220> uh<00:03:23.250> yeah<00:03:23.940> they

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
wouldn't quite work but uh yeah they

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.430 
wouldn't quite work but uh yeah they
really<00:03:24.209> don't<00:03:24.569> have<00:03:24.750> much<00:03:24.780> answer<00:03:25.290> should

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
really don't have much answer should

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.960 
really don't have much answer should
regret<00:03:25.739> other<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.100> like<00:03:26.280> solemn<00:03:26.609> warning

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
regret other than like solemn warning

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.879 
regret other than like solemn warning
but<00:03:27.450> sure<00:03:27.600> godia<00:03:27.810> very<00:03:28.019> good<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.470> did<00:03:28.680> get

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
but sure godia very good and did get

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.979 
but sure godia very good and did get
released<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> dark<00:03:29.760> world<00:03:29.989> structure

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
released in the dark world structure

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.569 
released in the dark world structure
deck<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.380> pretty<00:03:31.530> good<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.489> are

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
deck so that's pretty good if you are

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.039 
deck so that's pretty good if you are
going<00:03:32.730> first<00:03:32.970> Thunder<00:03:33.269> King<00:03:33.510> obviously<00:03:33.989> is

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
going first Thunder King obviously is

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.720 
going first Thunder King obviously is
really<00:03:34.319> good<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.069> like<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.370> found<00:03:35.519> when<00:03:35.700> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
really good but then like I found when I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.280 
really good but then like I found when I
was<00:03:35.910> usually<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.540> doing<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.840> Thun<00:03:37.049> working

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
was usually like doing that Thun working

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.020 
was usually like doing that Thun working
against<00:03:37.590> them<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:38.250> they<00:03:38.370> just<00:03:38.549> go<00:03:38.670> cop

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
against them like they just go cop

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.840 
against them like they just go cop
azules<00:03:39.329> and/or<00:03:40.200> saber<00:03:41.100> source<00:03:41.340> I'm<00:03:41.549> sorry<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
azules and/or saber source I'm sorry the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.150 
azules and/or saber source I'm sorry the
1900<00:03:42.510> normal<00:03:43.319> mulch<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.620> they've<00:03:43.769> just<00:03:43.799> point

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
1900 normal mulch and they've just point

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.840 
1900 normal mulch and they've just point
for<00:03:44.280> point<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.609> was<00:03:44.700> just<00:03:44.730> like

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
for point and I was just like

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.300 
for point and I was just like
disappointing<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.019> if<00:03:46.350> they<00:03:46.620> do<00:03:46.799> do<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.130> you

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
disappointing but if they do do that you

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.090 
disappointing but if they do do that you
can<00:03:47.430> drop<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.639> honest<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.389> them<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.100> then

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
can drop that honest on them and then

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.620 
can drop that honest on them and then
they'll<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.459> taking<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.850> 19<00:03:51.180> damage<00:03:51.480> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
they'll be taking that 19 damage and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.539 
they'll be taking that 19 damage and
then<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.709> know<00:03:52.829> obviously<00:03:52.859> if<00:03:53.370> they've

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
then you know obviously if they've

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.890 
then you know obviously if they've
already<00:03:53.819> went<00:03:54.060> through<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.209> saber<00:03:54.420> source<00:03:54.690> they

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
already went through a saber source they

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.330 
already went through a saber source they
possibly<00:03:55.319> could<00:03:55.470> draw<00:03:55.650> another<00:03:55.889> one<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.280> then

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
possibly could draw another one and then

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.400 
possibly could draw another one and then
it<00:03:56.819> could<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:57.000> problematic<00:03:57.359> for<00:03:57.569> them<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
it could be problematic for them but a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
it could be problematic for them but a
really<00:03:58.980> good<00:03:59.130> cards<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.639> uh<00:03:59.670> you<00:04:00.329> know<00:04:00.420> just

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
really good cards to uh you know just

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.020 
really good cards to uh you know just
get<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.900> first<00:04:01.470> negate<00:04:01.859> out<00:04:02.280> out<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.910> way

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
get that first negate out out of the way

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.569 
get that first negate out out of the way
are<00:04:03.359> like<00:04:03.690> smashing<00:04:04.200> ground<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.739> creature

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
are like smashing ground on creature

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.789 
are like smashing ground on creature
swap<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.389> mind<00:04:06.720> control<00:04:06.810> those<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.680> get

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
swap and mind control those just get

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.490 
swap and mind control those just get
loggias<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.400> uh<00:04:08.660> their<00:04:09.660> task<00:04:10.109> French<00:04:10.410> it

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
loggias like uh their task French it

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.259 
loggias like uh their task French it
just<00:04:10.650> makes<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.400> forces<00:04:11.970> them<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
just makes it like it forces them to the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.629 
just makes it like it forces them to the
gate<00:04:12.419> really<00:04:12.720> sometimes<00:04:13.650> when<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.489> mind

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
gate really sometimes when you mind

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.400 
gate really sometimes when you mind
control<00:04:14.970> they'll<00:04:15.209> give<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.569> you<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.989> then

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
control they'll give it to you and then

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.050 
control they'll give it to you and then
that<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.889> kind<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.250> bad<00:04:17.489> because<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> don't

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that is kind of bad because you don't

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.029 
that is kind of bad because you don't
actually<00:04:18.269> want<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.959> mind<00:04:19.200> control<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.650> because

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
actually want to mind control it because

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.080 
actually want to mind control it because
you<00:04:20.130> can't<00:04:20.160> really<00:04:20.459> do<00:04:20.639> anything<00:04:20.849> with<00:04:21.060> that

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
you can't really do anything with that

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.089 
you can't really do anything with that
you<00:04:21.239> can't<00:04:21.450> sit<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:22.109> can't<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.470> synchro

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
you can't sit you can't like synchro

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.830 
you can't sit you can't like synchro
with<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.940> can't<00:04:24.120> tribute<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:24.720> it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
with it and you can't tribute it so it

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.180 
with it and you can't tribute it so it
is<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> problem<00:04:25.260> but<00:04:25.500> they<00:04:25.650> usually<00:04:25.860> when<00:04:26.099> you

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
is a problem but they usually when you

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.560 
is a problem but they usually when you
just<00:04:26.340> go<00:04:26.490> mind<00:04:26.669> control<00:04:26.940> their<00:04:27.060> force

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
just go mind control their force

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.600 
just go mind control their force
data<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.200> I'll<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:28.560> do<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.800> um

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
data then just like I'll just do it um

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.700 
data then just like I'll just do it um
it's<00:04:30.150> kind<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.450> shin<00:04:30.780> there's<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.440> auto

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
it's kind of like shin there's like auto

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.530 
it's kind of like shin there's like auto
negate<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.190> really<00:04:32.940> good<00:04:33.030> car<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.300> they<00:04:33.390> can

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
negate it really good car that they can

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.330 
negate it really good car that they can
negate<00:04:33.750> super<00:04:34.260> poly<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.220> is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
negate super poly but that is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.130 
negate super poly but that is
conditional<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.240> know<00:04:36.360> II<00:04:36.390> heroes<00:04:36.840> only

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
conditional to you know II heroes only

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.290 
conditional to you know II heroes only
but<00:04:37.650> one<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.920> my<00:04:37.980> favorite<00:04:38.310> combos<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:39.150> like

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
but one of my favorite combos and I like

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.770 
but one of my favorite combos and I like
signing<00:04:39.660> this<00:04:39.750> is<00:04:39.960> electric<00:04:40.710> virus<00:04:41.690> what<00:04:42.690> it

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
signing this is electric virus what it

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.840 
signing this is electric virus what it
does<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:43.440> discard<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:44.760> the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
does is you just discard it to the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.250 
does is you just discard it to the
graveyard<00:04:45.270> but<00:04:45.510> if<00:04:45.660> there<00:04:45.810> are<00:04:45.900> running<00:04:46.110> deep

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
graveyard but if there are running deep

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.630 
graveyard but if there are running deep
fissures<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:46.950> be<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.130> problem<00:04:47.160> but

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
fissures and that can be a problem but

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.240 
fissures and that can be a problem but
most<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.090> them<00:04:48.150> are<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.650> just<00:04:49.770> go<00:04:49.890> electric

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
most of them are so you just go electric

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.070 
most of them are so you just go electric
virus<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.820> then<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.570> take<00:04:51.750> control<00:04:51.990> of

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
virus and then you take control of

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.140 
virus and then you take control of
Elijah<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.710> then<00:04:53.280> my<00:04:53.640> favorite<00:04:53.940> player<00:04:54.060> is

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
Elijah and then my favorite player is

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.400 
Elijah and then my favorite player is
just<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.360> socket<00:04:54.690> for<00:04:54.840> Chi<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.320> move

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
just a socket for Chi is just to move

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.350 
just a socket for Chi is just to move
out<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.830> way<00:04:55.860> but<00:04:56.460> obviously<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.180> to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
out of the way but obviously I like to

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.030 
out of the way but obviously I like to
attack<00:04:57.660> first<00:04:57.990> with<00:04:58.230> it<00:04:58.380> because<00:04:58.710> if<00:04:58.920> they

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
attack first with it because if they

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.250 
attack first with it because if they
want<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.280> like<00:04:59.400> deepers<00:04:59.730> in<00:04:59.820> their<00:04:59.970> own<00:05:00.260> Lodge

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
want to like deepers in their own Lodge

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.510 
want to like deepers in their own Lodge
attend<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.890> think<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.090> could<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.300> like

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
attend I think that you could just like

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.040 
attend I think that you could just like
you<00:05:05.520> could<00:05:05.700> negate<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.330> then<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.960> know

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
you could negate it and then you know

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.150 
you could negate it and then you know
you<00:05:07.140> can<00:05:07.260> still<00:05:07.410> sack<00:05:07.620> for<00:05:07.770> Christ's<00:05:08.010> maybe

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
you can still sack for Christ's maybe

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.880 
you can still sack for Christ's maybe
remove<00:05:08.430> another<00:05:08.790> back<00:05:09.030> row<00:05:09.210> but<00:05:09.750> yeah<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
remove another back row but yeah the

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.500 
remove another back row but yeah the
election<00:05:11.250> virus<00:05:11.460> very<00:05:11.700> good<00:05:11.910> plus<00:05:12.120> its<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.450> a

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
election virus very good plus its is a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.330 
election virus very good plus its is a
light<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.230> know<00:05:13.350> more<00:05:13.530> targets<00:05:13.860> for<00:05:13.950> BLS

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
light so you know more targets for BLS

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.190 
light so you know more targets for BLS
always<00:05:14.730> good<00:05:14.940> but<00:05:15.540> those<00:05:15.810> are<00:05:15.930> some<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.170> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
always good but those are some of the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.810 
always good but those are some of the
cards<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.650> thought<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.160> were<00:05:17.250> quite<00:05:17.490> great

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
cards I thought that were quite great

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.400 
cards I thought that were quite great
