00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
you want something small that will give

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.759 
you want something small that will give
you<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.079> same<00:03:37.260> wind<00:03:37.470> protection<00:03:37.620> as<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.129> blimp

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
you the same wind protection as a blimp

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.440 
you the same wind protection as a blimp
at<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.860> same<00:03:41.040> time<00:03:41.280> not<00:03:41.549> completely<00:03:42.030> covering

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
for the MT 55 as I'm using here you need

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.420 
for the MT 55 as I'm using here you need
the<00:03:52.349> 20<00:03:52.980> millimeter<00:03:53.190> grommet<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.099> a<00:03:56.129> soft

the 20 millimeter grommet this is a soft
rubber<00:03:56.670> grommet<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.239> will<00:03:57.989> take<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.409> of

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
rubber grommet and will take a bit of

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.960 
rubber grommet and will take a bit of
getting<00:03:58.650> used<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.220> get<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.400> microphone<00:03:59.849> in
