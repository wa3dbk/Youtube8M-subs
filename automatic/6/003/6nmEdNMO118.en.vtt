00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 the Alakrana 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.060
 very good figure 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.309
 this year the country burns 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 we are at the balanced 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.589
 for the theory 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.669
 I'm not paid saida db yes 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:18.490
 in our test 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.490
 it follows four legs 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.270
 Conversely 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.270
 this case 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.510
 we go to win 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 the techniques and there is 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.430
 indeed 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.510
 maybe the beginning at the end ap 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.960
 the pandemic problem 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.350
 think again 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.940
 it's not bad 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.780
 and not worth it 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380
 it's the call to palavas 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.440
 so that's it for the theory 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.859
 that's fulfilled at hezbollah so why 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.180
 double punishment 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.510

 as by chance 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.239
 For example 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.239
 here are some areas that's now what makes 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.409
