00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.300
 Midnight 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.220
 Sound warning 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.820
 Be 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.440
 0 am 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 You reach 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.780
 Light and larger heat, 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 At the fingertip 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.180
 To play 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.540
 sense, 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.040
 Sense, immediately 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.380
 Sensation, immediate feeling 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.160
 All sleeping on a quiet night, 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.080
 Only two secrets 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.420
 Feeling, 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.920
 Feeling, soon 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.300
 Feelings, pleasures soon 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 On repeated waveforms 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 I am fascinated. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700
 Do not forget, 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.520
 Do not forget, my voice. 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.200
 Beyond the screen, 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.760
 Give me love. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.620
 It's called virtual. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.220
 Do not throw it away saying it's virtual. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 Your 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.800
 To your voice 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.680
 I want to be out of your voice yet. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 Remember me, 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.180
 Remember me, my voice. 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.960
 You gave me 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 All of this body that you gave me 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.880
 Looking at each other 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.500
 Looking at each other with you 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.360
 With the breath that overlapped 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.140
 Breathing sounds and sounds, 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 Echo. 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 Midnight 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660
 A chilled cold 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.340
 Waited for 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.120
 0 am 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.820
 On the mirror 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.260
 Filled up 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.780
 unaware 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.640
 I do not know. 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.120
 sense, 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.620
 Sense, soon 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.920
 Sensation, immediate feeling 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 A quiet night with everyone sleeping 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.600
 Everyone sleeps in a quiet night and breath 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.980
 Feeling, 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.480
 Feeling, soon 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.840
 Feelings, pleasures soon 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.280
 The rusty logic (logic) 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.400
 I yearn for "once again" 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.340
 Do not forget, 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.080
 Do not forget, my voice 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.700
 Beyond the dimension 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.560
 Blowing signal 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.200
 It's virtual. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 Do not tell me it's virtual. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.240
 To your voice 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.460
 I still want to be loved by your voice 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.200
 Remember me, 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.780
 Remember me, my voice. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.540
 The one you gave me 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360
 All this body you gave me 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.480
 With words 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.440
 It's a mixture of words and first sounds. 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 With this breath 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.700
 This breath and sound, ring it. 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.460
 To the sound you created 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 I was just in love. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.140
 Sadness, anger, satisfaction, 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.400
 All that, 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.300
 Echo it. 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.580
 Shout constantly 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.040
 Loud 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.980
 Mix all the remaining heat 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.640
 I love you so much. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.380
 Shoutlessly 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.940
 I have a voice. 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.660
 Mix up the remaining heat 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.240
 Love is really shiny. 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.940
 I am attracted to 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.600
 Do not forget, 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.420
 My voice 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.140
 It's okay to go beyond the screen, 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.920
 Please love me properly. 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.600
 It's called virtual. 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.980
 Do not shake it off. 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.480
 To your voice 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.180
 I still want to be in your voice. 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.440
 Remember me, 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.220
 Remember me, my voice. 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.780
 The one you gave me 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.500
 All this body you gave me. 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.760
 Looking at each other 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.340
 Looking at each other with you 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.220
 With the breath that overlapped 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.100
 Sound, 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.020
 Reign. 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.960
 Your first sound, 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.840
 Let this voices be heard. 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.020
 Rumble. 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.620
 Reign.
