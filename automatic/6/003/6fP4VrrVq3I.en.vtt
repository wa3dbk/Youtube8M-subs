00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.730
 literally the universe of brides who 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.500
 entered my life for the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 newly formed and I decided to get married and then I 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 i got it 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.460
 I did mine and people started asking 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 perhaps because it was something 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.710
 a little out of the standard of that time 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.710
 and then I never stopped 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 My mother has always taught the 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.739
 I always say that my 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.150
 collection including these pieces are not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.620
 in my mother's story of my 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.620
 story when small 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.719
 involved in the bride's story the way 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.120
 of joining her expectation with 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:54.159
 what I propose is precisely 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 leave her very at ease I have to 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.409
 also have a sensitivity to perceive 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.559
 there a style a woman a style of 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.479
 life then a woman when she is 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.720
 when she is comfortable in the clothes she 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:12.909
 she uses it she looks a thousand times more beautiful 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.179
 a thousand times more fulfilling in its own way 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.490
 I wish I graduated in fashion design 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:25.300
 fashion from santa marcelina college 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:29.770
 this was in 97 and 99 was born from 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.970
 wedding dress and emanuelle brand 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.970
 junqueira was born in 2003 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.210
 over time I had to create other 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 lines beyond the unique line create a 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.680
 custom line 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.280
 I have the black line 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.020
 flame off white and aligns the reptile is that 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.550
 that's where I can put my colors 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.350
 that I can play a little more in the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.840
 my masterclass to educate 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.930
 I'll share with you a little of the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.510
 my inspiration from where it comes from all 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.450
 This creative process 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:18.010
 by the studio itself with details of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.140
 finishing embroidery of the 500 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.100
 choice of tissues. 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.100
 because of each one 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.659
 I hope we can explore together in this 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.659
