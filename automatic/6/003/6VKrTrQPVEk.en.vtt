00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.099
 but you should still today 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.630
 in the sound Isa strikes 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.630
 Roche will take this box Dr 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:12.979
 from his hair an accident 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.309
 we need this connection cable with jack 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.309
 and then games I like to join 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.429
 Upton 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429
 and by 0 2 percent in value 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.789
 and we need to give September the most appealing percent of the speakers 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.840
 Franks are wearing his clothes 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.920
 and we need here 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.560
 Power cable for this box 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.260
 I do that now too 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.470
 as the first from the theater man I grab this ca 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.560
 the antennas off 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.490
 Fruit without bank receipt 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.540
 the antennas out so that the sound is still well received 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.570
 and finally fucked 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.410
 in the device itself tipped 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.830
 the connection for the electricity 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.210
 This connection is a bit hakelig the traffic must go 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.460
 Stefan accordingly a little worse 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.470
 to press 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.470
 and finally the device a straw man 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.580
 in this case he already has automatically 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.280
 the brewers hired otherwise two so far no power appears 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.430
 Nominations are far too high there is too high 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.620
 condition whether all Brockhoff press 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
 important is that here 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.580
 that are incurred 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.030
 otherwise, of course, nothing works clearly 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.110
 OK 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.610
 it basically has to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.340
 he still stressed work to record with the bills on the calculator 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 and Vattenfall 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.140
 h critics my Dr 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.750
 I should be back in the device 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
 this Gramkow left the three policies connection 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 I was a bit rusty 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.919
 few minutes later 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.569
 Peak at correspondingly annoyed recording device in our case 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.169
 sits home says 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:22.659
 and we have 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.659
 then comes here in the microphone connection 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 what we still have is the station 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 She wants to stay in Vancouver for five weeks 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.839
 the respective speakers gets disguise 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.219
 you do not have to join this anymore, of course, point was about 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.399
 Point and there is 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.469
 but what you have to do with it 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:52.809
 you have to turn it on 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.069
 all around this is by hereby the two 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.009
 Squeeze pages together and here on and lineup, so to speak, the whole 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.849
 location 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.849
 so you can see again against the corresponding ausschlÃ¤gt 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.799
 The basic setting of this device are basically so that you can do that well 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.629
 use can be overdriven 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.359
 if it goes well okay 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.969
 I have glory again 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.569
 So just saved to those say you have failed up here too 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.009
 also called chute age so that can not be the sound Reginald 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.199
 mm in the short term exhibit so to speak on mute 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.919
 but you should not forget to set it again otherwise 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.349
 no sound is recorded 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.059
 we basically have that 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.439
 the entire 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.219
 Sound to the computer and drunk on the Camorra 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.389
 and percent more so that can fall asleep and the crusher concept 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.799
 connect 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.180
 start the software and thus the recording
