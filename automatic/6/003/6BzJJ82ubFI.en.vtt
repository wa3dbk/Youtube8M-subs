00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
bit bigger eighty nine point eight three

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.890 
bit bigger eighty nine point eight three
but<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:11.790> an<00:00:11.849> eighty<00:00:12.030> ninety<00:00:12.360> five<00:00:12.509> bottom

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
but it's an eighty ninety five bottom

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.060 
but it's an eighty ninety five bottom

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
bracket for a BB ninety two so I have to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.640 
bracket for a BB ninety two so I have to
use<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.460> bottom<00:00:17.789> bracket<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.390> which<00:00:19.080> ends<00:00:19.590> up

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
use my bottom bracket here which ends up

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.920 
use my bottom bracket here which ends up
being<00:00:19.710> ninety<00:00:20.160> two<00:00:20.310> millimeters<00:00:20.760> across<00:00:20.930> but

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
being ninety two millimeters across but

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.240 
being ninety two millimeters across but
I<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> use<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.920> point<00:00:23.160> five

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
I have to use this two point five

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.080 
I have to use this two point five
millimeter<00:00:23.699> spacer<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.320> drive<00:00:25.590> side<00:00:26.090> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
millimeter spacer on the drive side to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
millimeter spacer on the drive side to
make<00:00:27.750> sure<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.529> comes<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> ninety

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
make sure that it comes out to ninety

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
make sure that it comes out to ninety
two<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.519> that's<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> orientation<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
two so that's the orientation that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.870 
two so that's the orientation that
that's<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.040> into<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that's going to go into so all I have to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.100 
that's going to go into so all I have to
do<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> little<00:00:34.200> grease<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
do is put a little grease on there and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.770 
do is put a little grease on there and
I'm<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.600> basically<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
I'm going to use this basically a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.819 
I'm going to use this basically a
homemade<00:00:40.579> bottom<00:00:41.579> bracket<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.210> press<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
homemade bottom bracket to press and the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.260 
homemade bottom bracket to press and the
reason<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.219> did<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.120> didn't

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
reason I did this because they didn't

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.850 
reason I did this because they didn't
want<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> spend<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> money<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.559> bottom

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
want to spend a lot of money on a bottom

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680 
want to spend a lot of money on a bottom
bracket<00:00:46.950> press<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.969> base<00:00:48.149> layer<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.539> just

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
bracket press the base layer they just

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.790 
bracket press the base layer they just
made<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> mill<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:50.250> home<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
made this on a mill at home so so that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.229 
made this on a mill at home so so that
the<00:00:52.920> bottom<00:00:53.190> bracket<00:00:53.550> fits<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:53.940> into<00:00:54.120> this

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the bottom bracket fits right into this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
the bottom bracket fits right into this
little<00:00:54.800> indentation<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.250> centers

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
little indentation here so that centers

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.160 
little indentation here so that centers
it<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> those<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.920> each<00:00:58.980> side

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
it and I have one of those for each side

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
it and I have one of those for each side
so<00:01:01.170> those<00:01:01.500> will<00:01:01.680> fit<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.160> nice<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.550> nice

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so those will fit in there nice and nice

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.500 
so those will fit in there nice and nice
and<00:01:03.059> neatly<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> centered<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.510> it's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and neatly so it's centered and it's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.929 
and neatly so it's centered and it's
pushing<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> outside<00:01:07.650> rim<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
pushing just on this outside rim this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.679 
pushing just on this outside rim this
aluminum<00:01:09.479> ring<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.310> bearing<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
aluminum ring of the bearing and so it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210 
aluminum ring of the bearing and so it
doesn't<00:01:12.900> push<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.799> rubber<00:01:13.950> cup

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
doesn't push on there the rubber cup

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
doesn't push on there the rubber cup
itself<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.820> I'm<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.049> push

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
itself so I'm going to use this to push

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
itself so I'm going to use this to push
that<00:01:16.710> inside<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.460> use<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.790> couple<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that inside and just use a couple of

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.870 
that inside and just use a couple of
wrenches<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.680> nuts<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> in

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
wrenches on these nuts to to get it in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.870

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
there just can't a quick measurement

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.319 
there just can't a quick measurement
here<00:03:19.120> just<00:03:20.329> come<00:03:20.480> up<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.749> 96<00:03:21.409> millimeters

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
here just come up to 96 millimeters

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.800 
here just come up to 96 millimeters
across<00:03:23.739> see<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:25.329> so<00:03:26.329> now<00:03:26.450> maybe<00:03:26.540> six

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
across see that so now maybe six

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.559 
across see that so now maybe six
millimeters<00:03:27.290> across<00:03:28.090> ninety<00:03:29.090> five<00:03:29.239> point

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
millimeters across ninety five point

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.319 
millimeters across ninety five point
three<00:03:29.659> one<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.349> can<00:03:30.499> be<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:31.239> little<00:03:32.239> bit

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
three one but it can be a little bit

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.569 
three one but it can be a little bit
wider<00:03:32.480> than<00:03:32.719> that<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.219> looks<00:03:34.219> like<00:03:34.310> my

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
wider than that so looks like my

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.099 
wider than that so looks like my
measurement<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.150> good<00:03:35.389> I<00:03:35.540> know<00:03:35.719> I<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.930> put

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
measurement is good I know I can put

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.250 
measurement is good I know I can put
together<00:03:37.090> my<00:03:38.090> chain<00:03:38.420> ring<00:03:38.599> on<00:03:38.780> here<00:03:39.109> and
