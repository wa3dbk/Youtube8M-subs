we<00:00:03.540> associate<00:00:04.080> good<00:00:04.500> hearing<00:00:05.009> with<00:00:05.190> having

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
we associate good hearing with having

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.540 
we associate good hearing with having
big<00:00:05.819> ears<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.960> outside<00:00:07.680> bit<00:00:07.919> here<00:00:08.189> because

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
big ears this outside bit here because

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.250 
big ears this outside bit here because
you<00:00:08.880> know<00:00:08.970> really<00:00:09.360> bigger<00:00:09.540> helps<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.019> collect

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you know really bigger helps you collect

you know really bigger helps you collect
the<00:00:10.620> sound<00:00:10.969> but<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> torn<00:00:12.509> out<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
the sound but this is a torn out on the

the sound but this is a torn out on the
tour<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> elves<00:00:13.500> also<00:00:13.799> got<00:00:13.950> really<00:00:14.190> good

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
tour the elves also got really good

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.109 
tour the elves also got really good
hearing<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> hasn't<00:00:15.389> got<00:00:16.080> any<00:00:16.199> big<00:00:16.560> ears

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
hearing but it hasn't got any big ears

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.160 
hearing but it hasn't got any big ears
except<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.300> has<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.900> they're

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
except that it has it's just they're

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529 
except that it has it's just they're
harder<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.859> if<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.789> look<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.210> shape

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
harder to see if you look at this shape

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.830 
harder to see if you look at this shape
here<00:00:22.080> there's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.590> rigid<00:00:23.269> set<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.449> feathers

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
here there's a rigid set of feathers

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.529 
here there's a rigid set of feathers
going<00:00:25.109> around<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:26.250> heart-shaped<00:00:27.029> bit<00:00:27.269> on

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
going around that heart-shaped bit on

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.500 
going around that heart-shaped bit on
the<00:00:27.810> Owls<00:00:27.930> face<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> inside<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.580> these

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the Owls face and inside here these

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.799 
the Owls face and inside here these
feathers<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.740> soft<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> these

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
feathers are all really soft so these

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.560 
feathers are all really soft so these
are<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.680> Owls<00:00:34.860> ears<00:00:35.460> they're<00:00:35.760> too<00:00:36.000> big<00:00:36.300> sort

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
are the Owls ears they're too big sort

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
are the Owls ears they're too big sort
of<00:00:36.660> cut<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.559> instead<00:00:37.829> being<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> outside

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of cut but instead being on the outside

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.369 
of cut but instead being on the outside
of<00:00:38.730> its<00:00:38.820> head<00:00:39.059> they're<00:00:39.300> back<00:00:39.570> around<00:00:39.960> its<00:00:40.200> eyes

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
of its head they're back around its eyes

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.340 
of its head they're back around its eyes
and<00:00:40.860> when<00:00:41.219> sound<00:00:41.489> comes<00:00:41.879> towards<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> owl<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and when sound comes towards the owl it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
and when sound comes towards the owl it
these<00:00:44.129> big<00:00:44.460> ears<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.000> made<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> feathers

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
these big ears that made out of feathers

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.630 
these big ears that made out of feathers
will<00:00:46.469> direct<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> sound<00:00:47.160> down<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:49.340> think<00:00:50.340> about

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
will direct the sound down I think about

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.950 
will direct the sound down I think about
the<00:00:50.820> physical<00:00:51.239> environment<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.840> these

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the physical environment that these

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
the physical environment that these
animals<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.559> living<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.520> imagine<00:00:54.030> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
animals are living in so imagine this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.069 
animals are living in so imagine this
owl<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> dark<00:00:55.320> night<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.690> there's<00:00:57.690> no<00:00:57.840> light

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
owl on a dark night and there's no light

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.069 
owl on a dark night and there's no light
so<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> can't<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.520> well<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.690> around

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
so it can't see very well but all around

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
so it can't see very well but all around
it<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> sound<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.579> sound<00:01:03.030> waves

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it there is sound there are sound waves

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
it there is sound there are sound waves
traveling<00:01:03.930> past<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.589> might<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.739> some

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
traveling past it there might be some

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
traveling past it there might be some
sound<00:01:05.460> waves<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.939> local<00:01:06.299> Road<00:01:06.540> there

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
sound waves from a local Road there

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.649 
sound waves from a local Road there
might<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.950> sound<00:01:08.340> waves<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:08.970> scuttling

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
might be some sound waves from scuttling

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.870 
might be some sound waves from scuttling
beetles<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:10.950> some<00:01:11.520> sound

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
beetles and there might be some sound

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
beetles and there might be some sound
waves<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.810> come<00:01:13.020> from<00:01:13.140> something<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
waves that come from something like a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
waves that come from something like a
vole<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.520> mammal<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.060> scooting

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
vole a little mammal that's scooting

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
vole a little mammal that's scooting
around<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> grass<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.670> mammal

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
around in the grass and a little mammal

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390 
around in the grass and a little mammal
doesn't<00:01:18.659> push<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.320> much<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> air<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
doesn't push very much on the air as it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.600 
doesn't push very much on the air as it
moves<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> doesn't<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:21.330> very<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.630> sound

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
moves it doesn't make very much sound

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.160 
moves it doesn't make very much sound
but<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> owl's<00:01:24.299> environment<00:01:25.020> those

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
but in the owl's environment those

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
but in the owl's environment those
little<00:01:25.439> sounds<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.920> drifting<00:01:26.220> past<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.030> from

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
little sounds be drifting past it from

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
little sounds be drifting past it from
lots<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.720> different<00:01:27.780> directions<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:28.979> imagine

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
lots of different directions so imagine

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
lots of different directions so imagine
this<00:01:29.610> owl<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.780> sound<00:01:31.110> waves<00:01:31.290> coming

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
this owl with these sound waves coming

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
this owl with these sound waves coming
at<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.340> different<00:01:32.400> directions<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
at it from different directions and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.649 
at it from different directions and
somehow<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> find<00:01:35.130> dinner<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.659> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
somehow it's got to find dinner and so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.100 
somehow it's got to find dinner and so
it<00:01:36.780> uses<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.619> parabolic<00:01:38.490> reflectors<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it uses these parabolic reflectors to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.940 
it uses these parabolic reflectors to
direct<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.950> sound<00:01:41.689> into<00:01:42.689> its<00:01:42.840> inner<00:01:43.079> ear<00:01:43.290> as

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
direct that sound into its inner ear as

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.999 
direct that sound into its inner ear as
if<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> vols<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.229> sound<00:01:46.619> comes

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
if the vols over here the sound comes

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
if the vols over here the sound comes
towards<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> owl<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> only<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> owl<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
towards the owl and only if the owl is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
towards the owl and only if the owl is
looking<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> source<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.220> sound

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
looking right at the source of the sound

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.300 
looking right at the source of the sound
well<00:01:51.390> these<00:01:51.630> ears<00:01:51.960> hear<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> sound<00:01:53.040> really

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
well these ears hear the sound really

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
well these ears hear the sound really
loudly<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> owl<00:01:54.659> can

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
loudly and that's how the owl can

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.990 
loudly and that's how the owl can
localize<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.100> sound<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.549> doesn't<00:01:56.820> listen

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
localize the sound it doesn't listen

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.959 
localize the sound it doesn't listen
equally<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.079> all<00:01:58.170> directions<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
equally in all directions like we do it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
equally in all directions like we do it
listens<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.960> specific<00:02:01.710> direction<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
listens in a very specific direction and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.650 
listens in a very specific direction and
that's<00:02:02.820> how<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> finds<00:02:03.450> its<00:02:03.570> dinner

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.750

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
that will help it let that light but

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.490 
that will help it let that light but
they're<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:49.920> big<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.400> they<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.730> physically<00:02:51.209> be

they're as big as they can physically be
inside<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.709> skull<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.310> look<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.760> if

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
inside this skull just look at that if

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.640 
inside this skull just look at that if
they<00:02:54.030> were<00:02:54.090> any<00:02:54.360> bigger<00:02:54.600> they'd<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.050> touching
