around<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:49.010> frame<00:00:49.280> here<00:00:49.699> is<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.690> zero<00:00:51.229> three

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
around this frame here is the zero three

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.969 
around this frame here is the zero three
one<00:00:52.010> eight<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.750> actually<00:00:54.229> new<00:00:54.739> for<00:00:54.890> this

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
one eight it's actually new for this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.100 
one eight it's actually new for this
year<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.369> it<00:00:56.239> has<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.600> stuff<00:00:56.839> I<00:00:56.960> was<00:00:57.049> talking

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
year and it has that stuff I was talking

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.259 
year and it has that stuff I was talking
about<00:00:57.229> earlier<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:57.799> flecked<00:00:58.400> a<00:00:58.610> technology

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
about earlier but flecked a technology

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.299 
about earlier but flecked a technology
built<00:00:59.479> into<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.869> arm<00:01:00.049> all<00:01:00.559> that<00:01:00.860> means<00:01:01.040> really

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
built into the arm all that means really

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.759 
built into the arm all that means really
is<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.909> can<00:01:02.059> bend<00:01:02.299> the<00:01:02.420> arms<00:01:02.720> like<00:01:03.710> that

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
is that you can bend the arms like that

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.800 
is that you can bend the arms like that
without<00:01:04.610> them<00:01:04.879> breaking<00:01:05.089> which<00:01:05.390> means<00:01:05.659> that

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
without them breaking which means that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.870 
without them breaking which means that
when<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:05.990> put<00:01:06.110> them<00:01:06.229> on<00:01:06.409> there's<00:01:07.399> much<00:01:07.670> less

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
when you put them on there's much less

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.910 
when you put them on there's much less
pressure<00:01:08.119> against<00:01:08.539> your<00:01:08.689> head<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.859> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
pressure against your head and it's a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.209 
pressure against your head and it's a
much<00:01:10.130> more<00:01:10.310> comfortable<00:01:10.549> wear<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:12.219> there's

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
much more comfortable wear and there's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.279 
much more comfortable wear and there's
this<00:01:13.340> frame<00:01:13.579> as<00:01:13.700> well<00:01:13.880> which<00:01:14.810> once<00:01:15.020> again

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
this frame as well which once again

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.499 
this frame as well which once again
hasn't<00:01:16.070> reflected<00:01:16.340> technology<00:01:17.060> built<00:01:17.270> into

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
hasn't reflected technology built into

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.230 
hasn't reflected technology built into
