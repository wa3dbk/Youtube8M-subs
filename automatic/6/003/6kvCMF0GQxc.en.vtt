00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.599
 red guy 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.019
 so frankly why am I here to log in for sure resources 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.679
 added human cost 15 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.859
 hello madam i remind you about my draft equality agreement 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.169
 professional men-women 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.480
 I remember the states moby 90 gauthier but I would first of all go 

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.949
 further in more detail 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.160
 for example, I do not see what can be done about access to 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.869
 employment and and promotion but I'm proud of a building company and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080
 peter pham postulants in our August trades 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.080
 we are only a dozen on a buffalo chessboard 40 calories 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.570
 you know as you most technip thyssenkrupp companies get 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 places this problem on them 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.530
 gold to avoid a penalty applicable from January 2012 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 your agreement must deal with conditions of access to employment 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.590
 training and professional promotion 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.760
 in your case it is not useless for one to engage on firm coas in 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.340
 terms of hiring or promotion 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.760
 it would not make much sense 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.770
 you can it's anchored and partnerships with schools 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.340
 in order to create vocations 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.130
 we are close to the students 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.970
 you can also work related to your job offer less in their 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.890
 content to reflect a true mix or why not you 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.250
 engage arles receive it selected as many parma candidates 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.480
 cuche 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.720
 but still more ideas 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.430
 by contract on vocational training we do not do any 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.500
 distinction so we have a need to set up a training crif it 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.700
 will borrow coors 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.500
 listen is good to provide in an agreement that we do not discriminate a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.820
 theme according to gender 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 this being done to read anyway a little further 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 it to promote professional equality 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.549
 but you have to preserve all the collaborators including those who 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.780
 have charges of 2 16 billion 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 five parties in training little impacted in the personal life to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.940
 contributors 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.630
 to be able to generate for them additional costs around the custody of 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.190
 children for example 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.180
 so you can predict that the formations will take place separately 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.370
 period of school holidays and which is closer to home or 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.480
 workplace taxes reduce unnecessary travel times and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.140
 why not raise your eyes to finance the possible expenses 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.629
 additional 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.799
 after first of all re the second thematic which relates to the conditions 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.430
 of work and particularly that of part-time employees 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.430
 the king has already negotiated for the purpose of stalking the customers 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.269
 finally we have reduced home victory the yards we also 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.700
 implored the versatile I know it by heart and clatter loud I have 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.449
 really a nice gift for each of us 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:44.319
 you can leave the subject on this theme but in fact nothing 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.119
 prevents bouncing 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.259
 on your senior agreement on his ideas for you will not forget about the eu the 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:51.229
 to quote 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.229
 after you go to the third theme 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.700
 and the contours of the link between professional life and 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.439
 family responsibilities 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.820
 so there attention 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.820
 when it's so close the measurements will have to be 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.049
 visiting men 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.159
 that women 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.309
 for example, you can plan schedules for Apple 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.540
 employees a year of young children the group for their needs related to the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.939
 dependence of their own parents 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.719
 in another register one could think another who comes from the services of 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.470
 conciergerie who are still fava has developed a recent years 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.649
 while reformed I'm not sure I can release a budget or 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:34.429
 to listen to the vault see a man this being know that more 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.249
 these services are not necessarily an exorbitant cost 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.730
 and that can not quite fit your structure so here it is at 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.450
 some zealous 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.579
 % and this being you will not forget last 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.569
 to negotiate 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.009
 on the possibility of contributing in the field of old-age insurance on a 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.009
 full-time salary we check the part-time 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.639
 I hope I have responded to bunch of concern% and I point out that 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:03.980
 we have devoted an article 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.509
 cycle in our social cases 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.409
 management rh insured 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.010
 this subject with others 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.519
 examples I invite you to go check out this article on our evidence 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.759
 site yes but still resume confusion 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.969
 why not rather the Germans focused on reducing spending 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.740
 public and calling not to be missed 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.080
 in fact it is not part of the themes in Europe 80% and garagnas 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.979
 it's on penalty 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.099
 the negotiation enters on the reduction of the gaps in celebration is integrated into the 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.529
 nao the salary so if you decide however to address here pay attention to this 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:38.849
 that it does not interfere 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.430
 % And the others 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.300
 its thematic and humble agreement testifies clearer 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.460
 Clement did not make a good day 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.920
 the same Madam's voice stranglehold was not come back without making noise and to 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.919
 soon have a job 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.180
 since a long time
