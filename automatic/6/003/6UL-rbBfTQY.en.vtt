about<00:01:06.840> today<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> dictating<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:09.560> counters

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
about today is dictating my counters

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.630 
about today is dictating my counters
reactions<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.670> where<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.330> feel<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:13.020> strength<00:01:13.640> if

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
reactions by where I feel my strength if

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120 
reactions by where I feel my strength if
I<00:01:14.850> hope<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.420> would<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.600> stand<00:01:16.140> blindly<00:01:16.950> at

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I hope they would just stand blindly at

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
I hope they would just stand blindly at
him<00:01:17.369> even<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> hundreds<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.770> different

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
him even do one of hundreds of different

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
him even do one of hundreds of different
gone<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.670> school<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.630> by<00:01:21.840> dictating<00:01:22.409> where<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
gone to school but by dictating where I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.240 
gone to school but by dictating where I
strike<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.290> dictating<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
strike and dictating how he has to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
strike and dictating how he has to
respond<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.840> knowing<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
respond to that and then knowing the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
respond to that and then knowing the
counter<00:01:28.950> off<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:30.000> lets<00:01:30.329> me<00:01:30.509> be

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
counter off with that it lets me be

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.360 
counter off with that it lets me be
three<00:01:31.170> steps<00:01:31.470> ahead<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
three steps ahead of

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.900 
three steps ahead of
hacker<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> let's<00:01:34.740> look<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.580> was<00:01:35.760> to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
hacker so let's look at this if I was to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.290 
hacker so let's look at this if I was to
strike<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.450> his<00:01:36.660> center<00:01:37.140> line<00:01:37.730> he<00:01:38.730> might<00:01:39.000> walk

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
strike to his center line he might walk

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.020 
strike to his center line he might walk
that<00:01:39.630> way<00:01:40.010> or<00:01:41.240> he<00:01:42.240> might<00:01:42.450> block<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that way or he might block that so I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.980 
that way or he might block that so I
want<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> counter<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
want to know the counter to that and I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.220 
want to know the counter to that and I
want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.410> know<00:01:49.530> over<00:01:49.740> counter<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.230> that

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
want to know over counter to that that

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.440 
want to know over counter to that that
way<00:01:52.530> even<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> those<00:01:53.640> things<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:54.120> he

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
way even one of those things that he

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
way even one of those things that he
does<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.230> dictated<00:01:55.620> with<00:01:56.190> my<00:01:56.370> center<00:01:56.790> line

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
does that I dictated with my center line

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
does that I dictated with my center line
strike<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.690> know<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.380> counter<00:01:58.830> off<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.220> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
strike I know the counter off of the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.990 
strike I know the counter off of the
media<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.690> if<00:02:01.170> he<00:02:01.320> strikes<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.580> throw<00:02:02.850> them

media now if he strikes and I throw them
this<00:02:03.210> side<00:02:03.480> of<00:02:03.720> his<00:02:03.870> head<00:02:04.050> I'll<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.740> forcing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this side of his head I'll be forcing

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.270 
this side of his head I'll be forcing
him<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.550> walk<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.270> way<00:02:06.540> either<00:02:07.440> he's<00:02:07.950> going
