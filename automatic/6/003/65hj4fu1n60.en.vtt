battery<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.859> these<00:00:20.730> things<00:00:21.060> run<00:00:21.300> off

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
battery on it and these things run off

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.420 
battery on it and these things run off
they're<00:00:22.260> supposed<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> run<00:00:22.740> off<00:00:22.890> three<00:00:23.160> double

they're supposed to run off three double
A<00:00:23.490> batteries<00:00:23.720> so<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:24.900> more<00:00:25.050> voltage<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
A batteries so that's more voltage and

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
A batteries so that's more voltage and
it<00:00:27.090> worked<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:27.779> good<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.590> while

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it worked really good for a little while

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.349 
it worked really good for a little while
but<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> gears<00:00:29.490> strip<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
but then the gears strip so that I'm I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.849 
but then the gears strip so that I'm I
just<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> propeller<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> motor<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
just put a propeller on the motor and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.360 
just put a propeller on the motor and
that<00:00:31.949> works<00:00:32.940> pretty<00:00:33.149> good<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.440> got<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that works pretty good but I got this

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.770
