again<00:01:45.090> market<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.570> short-term<00:01:45.930> extended

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
again market is short-term extended

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
again market is short-term extended
volume<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> getting<00:01:47.159> very<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.430> light<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.090> at

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
volume is getting very very light but at

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.910 
volume is getting very very light but at
the<00:01:48.390> same<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.810> folks<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.470> Fed<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.740> in

the same time folks the Fed is in
control<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.460> light<00:01:50.820> volume<00:01:51.090> dictates

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
control because light volume dictates

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
control because light volume dictates
they<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:52.020> control<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> yesterday<00:01:53.159> they

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they can control it yesterday they

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
they can control it yesterday they
couldn't<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.240> volume<00:01:54.990> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
couldn't because it was more volume it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
couldn't because it was more volume it
was<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> surprise<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> Federal<00:01:57.270> Reserve

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
was a surprise but the Federal Reserve

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
was a surprise but the Federal Reserve
is<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.840> giving<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.320> don't<00:01:58.740> look<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
is not giving up don't look for them to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
is not giving up don't look for them to
give<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.520> anytime<00:01:59.820> soon<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.479> fact<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.079> think

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
give up anytime soon in fact I do think

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.569 
give up anytime soon in fact I do think
we'll<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.619> some<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:01.950> days<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.520> there

we'll get some down days here and there

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.580 
we'll get some down days here and there
but<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> most<00:02:03.479> part<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.259> assume

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
but for the most part you have to assume

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
but for the most part you have to assume
the<00:02:05.009> markets<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.549> held<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:06.030> least

to do in the short term and again you do

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.979 
to do in the short term and again you do
have<00:02:47.519> good<00:02:47.850> support<00:02:48.030> now<00:02:48.360> down<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> dollar

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.300 
have good support now down on the dollar
if<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.230> go<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> daily<00:02:49.769> chart<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.100> dollar

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
if I go to the daily chart of the dollar

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.130 
if I go to the daily chart of the dollar
there's<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.880> lot<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.150> support<00:02:51.660> going<00:02:51.870> back<00:02:52.019> to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
there's a lot of support going back to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.890 
there's a lot of support going back to
the<00:02:52.470> 2009<00:02:53.190> lows<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:53.940> which<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.360> again<00:02:54.570> tagged

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the 2009 lows here which we again tagged

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.210 
the 2009 lows here which we again tagged
and<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.410> gave<00:02:55.590> us<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.830> initial

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
and that's what gave us this initial

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.949 
and that's what gave us this initial
bounce<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.000> they<00:02:57.120> again<00:02:57.390> could<00:02:57.630> be<00:02:57.660> easily

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
bounce but they again could be easily

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.570 
bounce but they again could be easily
bring<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> dollar<00:02:58.620> back<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.069> retest<00:02:59.340> this

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
bring the dollar back and retest this

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.920 
bring the dollar back and retest this
and<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.819> should<00:03:00.060> send<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.360> market<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.720> little

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
and that should send the market a little

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.870 
and that should send the market a little
bit<00:03:01.019> higher<00:03:01.230> again<00:03:01.860> keep<00:03:02.130> an<00:03:02.280> eye<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.610> we
