conducting<00:02:20.710> some<00:02:21.220> experiments<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.270> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
conducting some experiments in a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.400 
conducting some experiments in a
facility<00:02:22.510> far<00:02:23.320> away<00:02:23.650> from<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:24.960> if<00:02:25.960> it's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
facility far away from here if it's

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.900 
facility far away from here if it's
still<00:02:26.740> functional<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:29.560> still<00:02:29.950> couldn't<00:02:30.430> reach

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
still functional we still couldn't reach

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.540 
still functional we still couldn't reach
it<00:02:31.560> there<00:02:32.560> isn't<00:02:32.980> time

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
I think we can still make it if we take

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.650 
I think we can still make it if we take
an<00:02:38.250> airplane
