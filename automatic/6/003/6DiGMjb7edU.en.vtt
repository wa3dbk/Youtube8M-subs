00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.370
 in the pc of the editorial are the 29 100 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.870
 cds arrived 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.059
 we already have that from phillips 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.219
 built up and we test now 20 times 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.690
 player as there support 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.529
 you can see the mower at his 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529
 wide screen 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.840
 our practi daniel had to go through the 20 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.949
 test and we'll show you now 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.420
 five examples 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.619
 These are positive and negative examples 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 this is how Battlefield 3 is getting 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.210
 started running right now with full hd 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.160
 So 1920 x 1080 and stops at almost everyone 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 at home and therefore, stop now 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.719
 at around 2 560 x 1080 and then when we do 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.719
 See if we see more 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 or not so long and you see 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.180
 You can see more here and you look up 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.220
 The right side could also be more 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.540
 say you have a battlefield 3 the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.290
 much better view with 21 9 lcd and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.200
 maybe even tactical advantage 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.300
 next we test quasi 3 therefore 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.070
 he has already started and we have 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.220
 a nice clue here 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.360
 over crates and in the 16 to 9 resolution 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.030
 is here 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.030
 your turns to 21 to 9 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.480
 and I can already tell you 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.480
 will see much more then 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.610
 just before seen and see now 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.610
 We speak the crate next to it yet 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.580
 So shortly 321 1 compatible 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.590
 the next game please 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.620
 after the two action games now play this 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.150
 strategyplay 21 70 we have it in 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.610
 full hd started and how one sees 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.950
 here and now we switch to 21 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.400
 10 9 and hope that you can do more 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.400
 looks 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.930
 he wants to be able to see it clearly here 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.849
 just it walked up here and now 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.799
 and that extends here to others 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.310
 page the same anno 2070 also 21.09 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.310
 compatible 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 then he started black ops 2 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:41.930
 first that one back in full hd 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 so put up to 119 puts on 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.340
 in each case the resolution is selectable 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.940
 and you see 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.420
 the picture is just stretched no 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.800
 advantages in black ops 2 pity as 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.260
 The teachers take care of that last 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:08.380
 and although the picture is stretched it runs 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.820
 still at 1920 x 1080 and looks like 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.740
 it looks and colleague puts it at times 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.740
 on 62 and on picture format automatically 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.590
 the picture changes but we see 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.020
 the more 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.540
 we do not see any more lara has barely 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.700
 changes have seen in topeka can 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.820
 you can select the resolution of the 265th 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.790
 x 1080 but the picture just becomes 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.800
 stretched, there is no advantage in 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.930
 we saw 21.09 works 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.830
 Do not play with everyone there 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.720
 players create a bit 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.150
 rework 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.650
 All 20 tested games's up 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.510
 the upcoming issue together with the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.880
 tests from the monitors with 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.000
 Reaction time input was up to the next 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.000
 times
