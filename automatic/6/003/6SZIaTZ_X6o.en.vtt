day but I always go rock climbing yes I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.510 
day but I always go rock climbing yes I
eat<00:02:02.299> basically<00:02:03.299> five<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.259> six<00:02:04.530> times<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:05.100> day<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
eat basically five to six times a day I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.839 
eat basically five to six times a day I
try<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> eat<00:02:06.450> high-protein<00:02:07.140> diet<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
try to eat high-protein diet if not I

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.790 
try to eat high-protein diet if not I
would<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:09.599> supplements<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.229> protein

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
would take supplements like protein

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.360 
would take supplements like protein
which<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> back<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.480> my<00:02:12.690> protein<00:02:13.370> supplements

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
which is back up my protein supplements

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.449 
which is back up my protein supplements
so<00:02:15.090> basically<00:02:15.780> five<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.290> six<00:02:16.500> times<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.920> day<00:02:17.069> it

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so basically five to six times a day it

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.640 
so basically five to six times a day it
depends<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.239> what<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> my<00:02:19.019> goal<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
depends on what is my goal is that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.250 
depends on what is my goal is that
certain<00:02:20.220> period<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.459> time<00:02:20.599> for<00:02:21.599> example<00:02:22.019> if<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
certain period of time for example if I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.290 
certain period of time for example if I
need<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.590> bulk<00:02:22.860> up<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.310> course<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.940> need<00:02:24.090> more

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
need to bulk up of course I need more

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.870 
need to bulk up of course I need more
