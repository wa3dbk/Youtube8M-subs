know you need to stop that arrogance and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.560 
know you need to stop that arrogance and
once<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.790> come<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
once you do that then you can come to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.359 
once you do that then you can come to
terms<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:06.990> who<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.220> be

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
terms with who you are and you will be

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.430 
terms with who you are and you will be
free<00:02:08.550> basically<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.450> he<00:02:09.840> actually<00:02:09.989> does

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
free basically and he actually does

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.540 
free basically and he actually does
and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.040> thought<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.460> actually

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and then I thought this is actually

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.000 
and then I thought this is actually
really<00:02:11.940> interesting<00:02:12.270> allusion<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.200> what's

tips I have with this episode and it's

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.390 
tips I have with this episode and it's
just<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.320> was<00:05:07.040> under<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.250> impression

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
just that I was under the impression

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400 
just that I was under the impression
that<00:05:08.170> even<00:05:09.170> our<00:05:09.320> Sasuke<00:05:10.450> Itachi<00:05:11.450> she's<00:05:12.170> away

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
that even our Sasuke Itachi she's away

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.480 
that even our Sasuke Itachi she's away
Madara<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:15.050> think<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.860> that's<00:05:16.190> it

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
Madara and I think that is that's it

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.460 
Madara and I think that is that's it
were<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.000> only<00:05:17.030> ones<00:05:17.420> who<00:05:17.630> could<00:05:17.810> who<00:05:18.050> could

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
were the only ones who could who could

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.580 
were the only ones who could who could

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
didn't know that that's what we do and

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.070 
didn't know that that's what we do and
then<00:05:37.430> on<00:05:37.520> top<00:05:37.670> of<00:05:37.730> that<00:05:37.850> don't<00:05:38.690> think<00:05:38.840> realize

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
then on top of that don't think realize

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.720 
then on top of that don't think realize
that<00:05:39.200> you<00:05:39.260> can<00:05:39.350> only<00:05:39.470> do<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.710> twice<00:05:39.800> like<00:05:40.220> I

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
that you can only do it twice like I

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.270 
that you can only do it twice like I
mean<00:05:41.060> you<00:05:41.150> don't<00:05:41.270> go<00:05:41.480> blind<00:05:41.660> twice<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.410> also<00:05:43.010> I

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
mean you don't go blind twice and also I

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.120 
mean you don't go blind twice and also I
thought<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:44.150> reason<00:05:44.510> why<00:05:44.600> kobato<00:05:45.200> became<00:05:46.100> a

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
thought the reason why kobato became a

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.430 
thought the reason why kobato became a
ninja<00:05:46.730> was<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.330> protect<00:05:47.840> his<00:05:48.020> orphanage

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
ninja was to protect his orphanage

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.930 
ninja was to protect his orphanage
family<00:05:48.890> from<00:05:49.990> ninja<00:05:50.990> i<00:05:51.200> think<00:05:51.620> so<00:05:52.220> why<00:05:52.430> is<00:05:52.490> his

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
family from ninja i think so why is his

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.790 
family from ninja i think so why is his
older<00:05:53.300> brother<00:05:53.510> or<00:05:53.990> his<00:05:54.170> older<00:05:54.500> foster

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
older brother or his older foster

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.650 
older brother or his older foster
brother<00:05:54.980> a<00:05:55.070> ninja<00:05:55.460> in<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.670> war<00:05:55.850> like<00:05:56.270> I<00:05:56.300> didn't
