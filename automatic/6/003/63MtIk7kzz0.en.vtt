00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:43.189 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.379 

just<00:05:44.189> a<00:05:44.249> problem<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:44.759> don't<00:05:44.819> know<00:05:45.029> how<00:05:45.149> to<00:05:45.209> right

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
just a problem I don't know how to right

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:53.589 
just a problem I don't know how to right

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:02.090 

Oh

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.460 

okay<00:06:02.670> didn't<00:06:02.910> calibrate<00:06:03.470> calibrated

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
okay didn't calibrate calibrated

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:38.149 
okay didn't calibrate calibrated
properly<00:06:04.620> but<00:06:05.160> that's<00:06:05.340> fine

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.979 

I<00:06:38.189> don't<00:06:38.879> know<00:06:38.999> if<00:06:39.119> you<00:06:39.300> see<00:06:39.509> it<00:06:39.599> but<00:06:39.809> it<00:06:39.899> says

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:39.989 
I don't know if you see it but it says

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:44.149 
I don't know if you see it but it says
hello<00:06:40.289> and<00:06:41.749> you<00:06:42.749> could<00:06:43.139> try<00:06:43.469> the<00:06:43.529> on-screen

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
hello and you could try the on-screen

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:56.950 
hello and you could try the on-screen
keyboard<00:06:45.469> let's<00:06:46.469> just<00:06:46.800> tip<00:06:47.039> it<00:06:47.069> in

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.800 

on<00:06:57.470> screen<00:06:57.770> keyboard

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.790 

and

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.409 

I<00:07:05.830> guess<00:07:06.400> you<00:07:06.520> can<00:07:06.669> just<00:07:06.699> type<00:07:09.120> but<00:07:10.120> I<00:07:10.150> wouldn't

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419 
I guess you can just type but I wouldn't

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.189 
I guess you can just type but I wouldn't
recommend<00:07:10.539> it<00:07:10.990> because<00:07:11.080> then<00:07:12.300> it<00:07:13.300> takes<00:07:13.599> very

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
recommend it because then it takes very

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.700 
recommend it because then it takes very
long<00:07:14.470> and<00:07:14.860> it's<00:07:15.069> very<00:07:15.130> hard<00:07:16.110> so<00:07:17.110> typing<00:07:17.590> would

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
long and it's very hard so typing would

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.909 
long and it's very hard so typing would
be<00:07:17.830> just<00:07:18.069> easier<00:07:18.840> but<00:07:19.840> then<00:07:19.990> if<00:07:20.410> you<00:07:20.560> want<00:07:20.710> you

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 
be just easier but then if you want you

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.520 
be just easier but then if you want you
can<00:07:21.009> actually<00:07:21.190> go<00:07:21.550> out<00:07:21.580> and<00:07:21.699> buy<00:07:21.910> those<00:07:22.530> $3,000

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
can actually go out and buy those $3,000

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.010 
can actually go out and buy those $3,000
smart<00:07:23.919> boards<00:07:24.220> or<00:07:24.340> whatever
