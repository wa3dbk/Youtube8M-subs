into very similar sized chunks now this

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
into very similar sized chunks now this
is<00:00:44.280> very<00:00:44.550> important<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.809> into<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
is very important when they go into the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.779 
is very important when they go into the
oven<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> cook<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> same

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
size so it's very important that your

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
size so it's very important that your
pieces<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.850> consistent<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:52.649> are

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
pieces are consistent and that they are

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.479 
pieces are consistent and that they are
close<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> same<00:00:54.300> size<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.809> possible<00:00:55.289> ok<00:00:55.770> so
