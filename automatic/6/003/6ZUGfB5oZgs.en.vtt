actually<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.009> very<00:01:26.100> easy<00:01:26.580> fold<00:01:27.020> when<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
actually a very easy fold when I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740 
actually a very easy fold when I
consider<00:01:28.500> Chris's<00:01:28.920> small<00:01:29.250> raise<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.030> Butch's

re-raise<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.470> gotta<00:01:31.740> believe<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.220> pocket

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
re-raise I gotta believe this pocket

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
re-raise I gotta believe this pocket
pair<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> no<00:01:33.060> good<00:01:33.270> here's<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.320> extremely

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
pair is no good here's an extremely

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.319 
pair is no good here's an extremely
important<00:01:35.460> principle<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
important principle for you to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.219 
important principle for you to
understand<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:39.119> need<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> better<00:01:39.689> hand<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
understand you need a better hand to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
understand you need a better hand to
call<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> raised<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.329> make<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
call a raised with then you do to make a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.450 
call a raised with then you do to make a
raised<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.110> I'm<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> repeat<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
raised with I'm going to repeat that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.030 
raised with I'm going to repeat that
again<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.570> need<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> better<00:01:46.079> hand<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> call

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
again you need a better hand to call

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.609 
again you need a better hand to call
arrays<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> raised

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
arrays with then you do to make a raised

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
arrays with then you do to make a raised
with<00:01:51.470> take<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> hand<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.070> example<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
with take this hand for example if I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
with take this hand for example if I
were<00:01:54.240> first<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> pot<00:01:55.049> I'd<00:01:55.439> raise<00:01:56.009> with

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
were first to the pot I'd raise with

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
were first to the pot I'd raise with
this<00:01:56.399> paradigms<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> wouldn't<00:01:58.170> call<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
this paradigms but I wouldn't call a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.139 
this paradigms but I wouldn't call a
raised<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.040> them<00:01:59.219> definitely<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
raised with them definitely not a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
raised with them definitely not a
re-raise<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.930> fact<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.829> wouldn't<00:02:02.310> call

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
re-raise in fact I wouldn't call

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
re-raise in fact I wouldn't call
butchers<00:02:03.030> re-raise<00:02:03.420> without<00:02:03.780> aces<00:02:04.259> kings

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
butchers re-raise without aces kings

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.580 
butchers re-raise without aces kings
