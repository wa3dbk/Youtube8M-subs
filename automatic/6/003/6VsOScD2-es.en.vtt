00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:19.610
 [music] 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 hello everyone again mdx i'm back 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.290
 to tell you what is 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 mixing in war thunder game but with very 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.340
 often wall streams and in contact and 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.490
 asks about what is information and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.310
 what is it eaten with and in this guide I will explain 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.050
 you can see how the mixing works and I 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.270
 I hope that everyone viewed this 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.530
 the video will not be left in question so mixing 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 mixing is the distance at which 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.570
 all aircraft weapons will come across 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.489
 at one point so it depends on 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.190
 your personal combat preferences 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.410
 someone likes to shoot from a kilometer like me 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.120
 that they are effective and someone loves 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.519
 shoot on rivet msa 100 meters like 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.469
 Kirill and depending on your usual 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.559
 distances open fire and you have to choose 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.510
 distance information in the game every kind in 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.350
 This menu and thought about the fact that 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.740
 choose now you see the explanation of these 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.020
 numbers 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.620
 I will try to explain with what each 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.600
 distance reduction is good or bad 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.760
 suppose we have the following situation we 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 fly to AIDS spotlight we were only 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.450
 machine guns which is in the wings and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.600
 our goal is 190 and for example if we 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.119
 the seat would stand at 300 meters what 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.810
 you have happened a lot fired only 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.079
 on the wings 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.850
 and bullets would you only have diverged than 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.869
 will there be anything more with distance if 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.170
 if we would get close to him then we would 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.840
 could lead more targeted fire if 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.899
 would we have information would stand 400 meters 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 then it would be a little easier to shoot it all 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.570
 that bullets would narrow to each other 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.700
 would approach them and resurrect more often all 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.579
 got on physio lived dad started 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.310
 wings if in the middle by 600 on that that 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.280
 the situation would be the same as with 200 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.170
 meters that is, he also fell on 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.870
 wings but fire was pretty 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.690
 embarrassing means which of these 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.240
 the options are best i would say that in 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.220
 in this case 400 meters but ideally 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.490
 Of course, the distance at which 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.790
 was in this herd 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.700
 put that is 300 meters well and in the game you 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.930
 something like this is shooting with 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.430
 mixing 200 meters that is 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 cross fire from about 400 meters 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.710
 so here that is already a house on 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.850
 long distance come down and fall in 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.880
 same point 400 meters and now 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.010
 600 meters that is, we shoot very 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.830
 small distance and they fall all 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.280
 together i think that moment is understandable for 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.320
 of all 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.170
 well now let's see what 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.170
 such a vertical seat and why him 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.840
 better not include well firstly 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.480
 upright seat historically 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.760
 practically not used this time and 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.420
 as you see when using vertically 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.570
 and gain 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.880
 we have a shell first will fly up 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.210
 in order to get to that point 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.820
 she who is sitting and then will 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.610
 only falls off when the reduction in 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.510
 us shell will have its usual 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.790
 ballistics i.e. first the projectile falls 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.730
 slowly slowly declining 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.270
 it can be predicted but when he 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.760
 included included vertically sitting here 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.670
 the problem is that first 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 projectile will be the top and then down and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.140
 for example someone will say that in frontal 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.720
 situations it is very good but i 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.100
 I will say that there is no such here 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.580
 down to 800 meters and included 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.000
 vertical information is included 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.530
 will get so first you have to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.110
 if the opponent is one and a half 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.100
 kilometer hyuna kim cobra you start 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.530
 open fire your sight is located 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.510
 higher opponent then when opponent 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.960
 will be at 800 meters you have a sight 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.010
 will have to be on the opponent and then 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.530
 little by little 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.300
 lower instead of just everything 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.150
 time to be above him and slowly 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.799
 go down to about here 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.460
 the collision reading that is there is very 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.800
 close range so i will say that 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.900
 better breaker checks children population 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.780
 it really hinders given that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.729
 each projectile has its own ballistics therefore 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.389
 guys really turn off and forget about 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.419
 it is not comfortable in it 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.039
 tell a little about the location 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:46.080
 armament and how it affects the choice 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:49.110
 information means if you have for example 190 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.520
 and you have all the main expression 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.830
 is no longer in us he is it very 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.270
 convenient in the way that you see what 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.360
 we have 200 metric tons 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.260
 tones that you will become their test we will 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.289
 very good 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.070
 mixing she let us shoot very 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.740
 exactly very, very precise, that is, always 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.800
 will hit the fuselage at that time 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.099
 as if we have to you and machine guns or 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.289
 gun I need something important reduction 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.669
 choose more carefully than 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.150
 with nasal means all the same 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.669
 choose 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.110
 I can tell you one thing that everything depends 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.990
 on your preference on which one 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.940
 distance open fire but immediately worth it 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.919
 better to open fire and less than 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.550
 on 300 meters some cases of course 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:45.770
 400a can finger and therefore the reduction of 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.990
 I recommend putting 300 meters 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.729
 some players about whom favorite 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.270
 aircraft with a nasal belief arms 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:58.110
 you can put both 400 and 500 meters 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.720
 perhaps if you are comfortable but on 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.130
 all aircraft whose weapons are weak 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.400
 the same typhoon I advise you to put two 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.150
 300 or even 200 meters because 7 and 7 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.770
 not able to punish at long distances 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.320
 well i hope in this video i'm all 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.360
 well explained 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.990
 I think that no one more 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.670
 left with questions about mixing 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.040
 everything became clear everything became its own 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.050
 places and hope no one else 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.260
 stream and in contact will not be set 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.630
 20 already bothered to ask if this 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.520
 the video was very helpful to you if 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.100
 have you found something new for yourself 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.320
 likes, well, and those who are not signed, of course 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.300
 subscribe 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.300
 release the flaps and see you in the rooms
