Drive is created by playing hard or

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.520 
Drive is created by playing hard or
whatever<00:00:59.000> but<00:00:59.210> it's<00:00:59.750> really<00:00:59.899> not<00:01:00.110> as<00:01:00.290> where

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
whatever but it's really not as where

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.740 
whatever but it's really not as where
you're<00:01:00.710> placing<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.340> notes<00:01:01.579> around<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.540> beat

is<00:01:03.530> what<00:01:03.860> creates<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.300> sound<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.960> do

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
is what creates the sound that we do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.070 
is what creates the sound that we do
because<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:07.820> when<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.090> vocal<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.600> going<00:01:08.900> on

the kick drum the Malon doing the snare
and<00:02:14.030> then<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.540> gets<00:02:14.690> hard<00:02:14.930> imagine

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and then it gets hard imagine

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.470 
and then it gets hard imagine
and<00:02:16.930> what<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.319> hi-hat<00:02:17.739> does<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:19.300> are

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and what the hi-hat does and and we are

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.240 
and what the hi-hat does and and we are
guitar<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.349> banjo<00:02:20.739> were<00:02:20.860> actually

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
guitar in the banjo were actually

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.010 
guitar in the banjo were actually
doubling<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.970> hi-hat<00:02:22.360> does<00:02:22.599> a<00:02:22.630> lot<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
doubling what the hi-hat does a lot of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.120 
doubling what the hi-hat does a lot of
times<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:23.470> we're<00:02:23.650> playing<00:02:23.860> mostly

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
times because we're playing mostly

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.350 
times because we're playing mostly
sixteenth<00:02:24.700> notes<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:28.090> how

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
sixteenth notes and but it's it's how

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.839 
sixteenth notes and but it's it's how
the<00:02:28.420> banjo<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.319> guitar<00:02:29.349> works<00:02:30.099> around<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
the banjo and guitar works around the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.780 
the banjo and guitar works around the
this<00:02:31.810> steady<00:02:32.170> downbeat<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.040> database<00:02:33.550> in

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
this steady downbeat of the database in

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.150 
this steady downbeat of the database in
the<00:02:33.880> mandolin<00:02:34.360> steady<00:02:34.840> down<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.319> out<00:02:35.440> that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
the mandolin steady down and out that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
the mandolin steady down and out that
creates<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.880> drive<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.450> creates<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.019> energy

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
creates the drive and creates the energy

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.759 
creates the drive and creates the energy
and<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.519> creates<00:02:40.090> dynamics<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.530> you're

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
and and creates dynamics you know you're

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.210

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
on the back of the beat and you have to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.750 
on the back of the beat and you have to
have<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> rhythm<00:02:50.560> guitar<00:02:50.950> player<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.459> thinks

the same way you do in order to achieve
that<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.310> that's<00:02:55.209> that's<00:02:55.750> kind<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.110> how<00:02:56.730> what

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
that and that's that's kind of how what

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.320 
that and that's that's kind of how what
our<00:02:57.910> sound<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.480> based<00:02:58.720> around<00:02:59.100> you<00:03:00.100> can

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
our sound is based around you can

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.670 
our sound is based around you can
example<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.510> give<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.870> semi<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:02.530> it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
example you can give to a semi so it's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.400 
example you can give to a semi so it's
hard<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.160> without<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.489> man<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.090> mean<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:04.810> you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
hard to do without a man I mean it's you

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.289 
hard to do without a man I mean it's you
can<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.860> can<00:03:06.040> kind<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.370> hear<00:03:06.580> like<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.090> pump

attention to where the downbeat is on my

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.800 
attention to where the downbeat is on my
foot<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> vocals<00:03:13.120> going<00:03:13.330> on<00:03:13.540> it'll<00:03:14.170> be
