00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
I actually just tried this out with

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.179 
I actually just tried this out with
Hikaru<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.410> kind<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.470> got<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> feeling<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
Hikaru and kind of got a feeling for the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.740 
Hikaru and kind of got a feeling for the
game<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> kind<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.210> butt<00:00:24.420> kicked<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
game and kind of got my butt kicked a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750 
game and kind of got my butt kicked a
little<00:00:25.019> bit<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.470> gonna<00:00:25.619> try<00:00:25.890> picking<00:00:26.130> Mila

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
little bit so I'm gonna try picking Mila

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.109 
little bit so I'm gonna try picking Mila
here<00:00:27.119> she's<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> zentradi<00:00:28.760> who<00:00:29.760> has<00:00:29.910> been

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
here she's a zentradi who has been

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.870 
here she's a zentradi who has been
micronized<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> pretty<00:00:32.520> neat<00:00:32.730> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
micronized and this is pretty neat it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.069 
micronized and this is pretty neat it's
one<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.090> those<00:00:33.180> games<00:00:33.420> where<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.840> choose

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
one of those games where you can choose

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.500 
one of those games where you can choose
from<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:35.130> characters<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:35.940> each<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
from different characters and each of

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
from different characters and each of
the<00:00:36.600> characters<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.230> basically<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> different

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the characters is basically a different

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
the characters is basically a different
ship<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> different<00:00:38.850> abilities<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.079> don't

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ship with different abilities so I don't

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.549 
ship with different abilities so I don't
really<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.920> exactly<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.600> ship<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
really know exactly what this ship is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.599 
really know exactly what this ship is
like<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.100> we'll<00:00:44.250> take<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.670> here

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.360 

so<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.480> game<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.839> cool<00:00:54.109> kind<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:54.829> follows<00:00:55.190> in

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
so this game is cool kind of follows in

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.700 
so this game is cool kind of follows in
with<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.699> mecca<00:00:56.239> of<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.809> Macross<00:00:57.230> universe

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
with the mecca of the Macross universe

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.860 
with the mecca of the Macross universe
where<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.010> can<00:00:58.399> change<00:00:58.730> forms<00:00:59.210> so<00:00:59.600> you've<00:00:59.719> got

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
where you can change forms so you've got

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.240 
where you can change forms so you've got
the<00:00:59.989> three<00:01:00.199> different<00:01:00.350> forms<00:01:00.800> here<00:01:01.070> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
the three different forms here and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.189 
the three different forms here and
what's<00:01:02.149> really<00:01:02.329> nice<00:01:02.449> is<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.989> three

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
what's really nice is that the three

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.859 
what's really nice is that the three
different<00:01:03.440> forms<00:01:03.679> have<00:01:03.859> different<00:01:04.330> fire<00:01:05.330> so

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
different forms have different fire so

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.060 
different forms have different fire so
you<00:01:05.930> know<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:06.290> nice<00:01:06.409> instead<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.799> having<00:01:07.009> to

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
you know it's nice instead of having to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.160 
you know it's nice instead of having to
pick<00:01:07.220> up<00:01:07.340> different<00:01:07.729> kinds<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.479> shots<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:09.049> can

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
pick up different kinds of shots you can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.779 
pick up different kinds of shots you can
just<00:01:09.380> change<00:01:09.649> your<00:01:09.799> form<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.280> you've<00:01:10.520> got

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
just change your form and you've got

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.630 
just change your form and you've got
those<00:01:10.939> automatically<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:13.250> also<00:01:13.399> have<00:01:13.520> these

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
those automatically you also have these

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.330 
those automatically you also have these
power<00:01:14.170> capsules<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.380> can<00:01:15.530> power<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:16.039> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
power capsules that can power you up and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.149 
power capsules that can power you up and
then<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.000> think<00:01:17.420> there's<00:01:18.110> one<00:01:18.259> that<00:01:18.439> says<00:01:18.619> S<00:01:18.890> on

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
then I think there's one that says S on

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.850 
then I think there's one that says S on
it<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:20.119> think<00:01:20.179> that<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.110> maybe<00:01:21.590> your

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
it and I think that that is maybe your

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.700 
it and I think that that is maybe your
spread<00:01:22.420> actually<00:01:23.420> as<00:01:23.539> opposed<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.020> speed<00:01:24.470> is

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
spread actually as opposed to speed is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.710 
spread actually as opposed to speed is
what<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:24.890> thought<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.280> might<00:01:25.460> be<00:01:25.640> but<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.450> don't

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
what I thought it might be but I don't

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.250 
what I thought it might be but I don't
know<00:01:26.810> for<00:01:26.990> sure

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.800 

but<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.220> just<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.520> fun<00:01:35.000> game<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.660> don't

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
but this is just a fun game and I don't

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.550 
but this is just a fun game and I don't
know<00:01:35.900> I'm<00:01:36.140> not<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.410> huge<00:01:37.070> fan<00:01:37.660> or<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:38.720> player<00:01:39.170> of

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
know I'm not a huge fan or a player of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.480 
know I'm not a huge fan or a player of
sure's

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
sure's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.170 
sure's
scrolling<00:01:41.240> shooters<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.840> do<00:01:42.140> enjoy<00:01:42.710> them<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.730> I

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
scrolling shooters I do enjoy them but I

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.420 
scrolling shooters I do enjoy them but I
know<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.110> don't<00:01:45.380> get<00:01:45.560> really<00:01:45.830> jazzed<00:01:46.160> about

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
know I don't get really jazzed about

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.260 
know I don't get really jazzed about
them<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:46.910> guess<00:01:47.270> I'm<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.720> kind<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:49.490> picky<00:01:49.790> but

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
them I guess I'm just kind of picky but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.380 
them I guess I'm just kind of picky but
I<00:01:50.660> really<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.530> Mac<00:01:52.040> Ross<00:01:52.280> games<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.940> think

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
I really like the Mac Ross games I think

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.490 
I really like the Mac Ross games I think
just<00:01:53.510> because<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:53.900> based<00:01:54.080> on<00:01:54.290> something

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
just because it's based on something

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.320 
just because it's based on something
that<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.770> know<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.310> they<00:01:55.700> always<00:01:55.910> seem<00:01:56.090> kind<00:01:56.270> of

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
that I know and they always seem kind of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.630 
that I know and they always seem kind of
fun<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.750> accessible<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:58.370> game<00:01:58.610> I

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
fun and accessible to and this game I

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.850 
fun and accessible to and this game I
think<00:01:58.910> falls<00:01:59.360> right<00:01:59.630> into<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.020> category<00:02:00.440> I

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
think falls right into that category I

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.800 
think falls right into that category I
definitely<00:02:01.790> had<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.000> play<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.360> couple<00:02:02.540> times

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
definitely had to play it a couple times

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.080 
definitely had to play it a couple times
this<00:02:03.410> first<00:02:03.680> level<00:02:03.950> here<00:02:04.250> before<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.640> got<00:02:04.940> it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
this first level here before I got it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.840 
this first level here before I got it
down<00:02:05.300> but<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.590> know<00:02:07.010> what<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.280> learn<00:02:07.460> for

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
down but you know what you learn for

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.310 
down but you know what you learn for
instance<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.360> want<00:02:08.540> to<00:02:08.600> avoid<00:02:08.929> all<00:02:09.140> this

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
instance that you want to avoid all this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.480 
instance that you want to avoid all this
this<00:02:10.330> space<00:02:11.330> debris<00:02:11.570> here<00:02:12.080> it's<00:02:12.650> really<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.130> lot

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
this space debris here it's really a lot

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.620 
this space debris here it's really a lot
of<00:02:13.520> fun<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:15.460> think<00:02:16.460> Milla's<00:02:16.970> weapons<00:02:17.330> here<00:02:17.510> are

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
of fun I think Milla's weapons here are

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.710 
of fun I think Milla's weapons here are
pretty<00:02:17.840> cool

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.990 

in<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.380> way<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.560> don't<00:02:21.800> know<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.010> liked<00:02:22.400> like

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
in a way I don't know I liked like

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800 
in a way I don't know I liked like
Hikaru's<00:02:24.040> cannon<00:02:25.070> he<00:02:25.280> had<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.520> mean<00:02:25.820> from<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
Hikaru's cannon he had that mean from a

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.020 
Hikaru's cannon he had that mean from a
main<00:02:27.050> laser<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:28.400> was<00:02:28.520> actually<00:02:28.790> pretty<00:02:28.910> useful

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
main laser it was actually pretty useful

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.850 
main laser it was actually pretty useful
right<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.570> this<00:02:29.720> part<00:02:30.200> here<00:02:30.410> because<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
right in this part here because the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.740 
right in this part here because the
lasers<00:02:31.220> shoot<00:02:31.790> up<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.120> down<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> little<00:02:32.570> bit

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
lasers shoot up and down a little bit

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.480 
lasers shoot up and down a little bit
right<00:02:32.900> around<00:02:33.110> your<00:02:33.320> ship<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.070> almost<00:02:34.220> acts

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
right around your ship so it almost acts

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.340 
right around your ship so it almost acts
like<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.820> shield<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:35.450> anything<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:36.020> coming

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
like a shield for anything that's coming

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.190 
like a shield for anything that's coming
from<00:02:36.560> above<00:02:36.800> or<00:02:36.980> below<00:02:37.130> but<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.930> really

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
from above or below but this is really

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.440 
from above or below but this is really
cool<00:02:39.410> here<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:39.860> these<00:02:40.010> it's<00:02:40.850> almost<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.270> some

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
cool here so these it's almost like some

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
cool here so these it's almost like some
sort<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.720> gravity<00:02:42.260> mines<00:02:42.530> or<00:02:42.830> little<00:02:43.010> black

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
sort of gravity mines or little black

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.979 
sort of gravity mines or little black
hole<00:02:43.580> generators<00:02:44.270> or<00:02:44.450> something<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
hole generators or something this is

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.380 
hole generators or something this is
actually<00:02:45.200> sucking<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.980> ship<00:02:46.220> towards<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.880> you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
actually sucking the ship towards it you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.940 
actually sucking the ship towards it you
can<00:02:47.510> see<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.810> sucking<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.620> debris

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
can see it's sucking all of the debris

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.479 
can see it's sucking all of the debris
towards<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.000> -<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.470> adds<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.190> little<00:02:52.310> bit<00:02:52.400> of

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
towards it - so adds a little bit of

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.330 
towards it - so adds a little bit of
extra<00:02:52.790> challenge<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.600> it's<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.680> fun<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.100> mean

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
extra challenge and it's just fun I mean

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.220 
extra challenge and it's just fun I mean
already<00:02:55.760> we've<00:02:56.150> seen<00:02:56.420> some<00:02:56.630> cool<00:02:56.810> stuff<00:02:57.080> you

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
already we've seen some cool stuff you

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.460 
already we've seen some cool stuff you
have<00:02:57.350> debris<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.040> need<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.370> avoid<00:02:59.470> you

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
have debris that you need to avoid you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.690 
have debris that you need to avoid you
have<00:03:00.560> enemies<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:01.010> come<00:03:01.190> from<00:03:01.340> different

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
have enemies that come from different

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.250 
have enemies that come from different
directions

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.929 

just<00:03:08.890> fun<00:03:09.159> stuff<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.640> know<00:03:09.760> upbeat<00:03:10.390> music<00:03:10.780> and

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
just fun stuff you know upbeat music and

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.000 
just fun stuff you know upbeat music and
I<00:03:12.939> just<00:03:13.180> love<00:03:13.329> how<00:03:13.480> it's<00:03:13.659> you<00:03:14.170> know<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.439> sort<00:03:14.890> of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
I just love how it's you know it sort of

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.470 
I just love how it's you know it sort of
feels<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:15.519> part<00:03:15.939> of<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> Mack<00:03:16.239> cross

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
feels like part of the Mack cross

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.819 
feels like part of the Mack cross
universe<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.140> think<00:03:17.170> that's<00:03:17.470> what<00:03:17.680> really

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
universe I think that's what really

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.949 
universe I think that's what really
draws<00:03:18.519> me<00:03:18.760> into<00:03:18.909> my<00:03:19.090> kind<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.390> engages<00:03:19.810> my

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
draws me into my kind of engages my

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.630 
draws me into my kind of engages my
imagination<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> little<00:03:20.799> bit<00:03:21.040> more<00:03:21.250> than<00:03:21.430> just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
imagination a little bit more than just

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.120 
imagination a little bit more than just
playing<00:03:21.849> some<00:03:22.360> random<00:03:22.659> shooter

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.980 

and<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.820> have<00:03:28.910> some<00:03:29.120> fun<00:03:29.270> memories<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:29.810> some

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
and I have some fun memories of some

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.100 
and I have some fun memories of some
other<00:03:30.170> macro<00:03:30.950> shooting<00:03:31.250> games<00:03:31.840> there<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:32.990> an

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
other macro shooting games there was an

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.570 
other macro shooting games there was an
arcade<00:03:33.560> game<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:36.310> remember<00:03:37.310> distinctly

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
arcade game and I remember distinctly

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.450 
arcade game and I remember distinctly
this<00:03:38.330> is<00:03:38.570> I<00:03:38.810> guess<00:03:39.020> I'll<00:03:39.460> geographically

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
this is I guess I'll geographically

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.640 
this is I guess I'll geographically
locate<00:03:40.880> myself<00:03:41.300> a<00:03:41.420> little<00:03:41.660> bit<00:03:41.810> in<00:03:41.990> terms<00:03:42.230> of

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
locate myself a little bit in terms of

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.920 
locate myself a little bit in terms of
the<00:03:43.520> fact<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.060> played<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.660> game

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the fact that I played this game

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.080 
the fact that I played this game
specifically<00:03:45.860> at<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.130> Student<00:03:46.520> Center<00:03:46.910> at

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
specifically at the Student Center at

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.710 
specifically at the Student Center at
the<00:03:47.390> University<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.110> Massachusetts<00:03:48.350> Amherst

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the University of Massachusetts Amherst

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.980 
the University of Massachusetts Amherst
they<00:03:50.720> had<00:03:51.020> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:52.790> arcade<00:03:53.240> set<00:03:53.510> up<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.870> was

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
they had a little arcade set up it was

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.390 
they had a little arcade set up it was
actually<00:03:54.110> really<00:03:54.530> neat<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.710> haven't<00:03:55.220> really

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
actually really neat I haven't really

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.580

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
wanted to own an arcade cabinet but

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.260 
wanted to own an arcade cabinet but
mostly<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.350> play<00:04:39.590> games<00:04:40.520> like<00:04:40.730> this<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.150> it

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
mostly to play games like this and it

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.090 
mostly to play games like this and it
things<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.750> are<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.900> released<00:04:42.440> on<00:04:42.560> console

things that are a released on console

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.140 
things that are a released on console
but<00:04:43.310> for<00:04:44.270> an<00:04:44.360> actual<00:04:44.900> arcade<00:04:45.530> board<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:46.520> have<00:04:46.970> to

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
but for an actual arcade board I have to

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.120 
but for an actual arcade board I have to
say<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.660> Mac<00:04:48.170> Ross<00:04:48.440> game<00:04:48.680> would<00:04:48.950> be

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
say that that Mac Ross game would be

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.920 
say that that Mac Ross game would be
pretty<00:04:49.430> nostalgic<00:04:50.120> for<00:04:50.300> me<00:04:50.420> that<00:04:50.690> would<00:04:50.810> be<00:04:50.840> a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
pretty nostalgic for me that would be a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.970 
pretty nostalgic for me that would be a
pretty<00:04:51.440> darn<00:04:51.710> awesome<00:04:51.830> Cabul

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.920 

so<00:04:56.460> when<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.640> played<00:04:56.880> us<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.120> car<00:04:57.330> before<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.750> got

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
so when I played us a car before I got

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.860 
so when I played us a car before I got
tricked<00:04:58.380> by<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:59.640> enemy<00:05:00.000> there<00:05:00.210> this

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
tricked by that that enemy there this

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.330 
tricked by that that enemy there this
time<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.110> just<00:05:01.380> left<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.650> alone<00:05:01.740> because<00:05:02.190> it's

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
time I just left it alone because it's

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.200 
time I just left it alone because it's
pretty<00:05:02.610> easy<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:03.380> accidentally<00:05:04.380> run<00:05:04.470> into<00:05:04.620> it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
pretty easy to accidentally run into it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:14.760 
pretty easy to accidentally run into it
there's<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.240> lot<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.450> help

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.920 

so<00:05:15.340> I<00:05:15.370> actually<00:05:15.580> have<00:05:15.849> not<00:05:16.120> beaten<00:05:16.449> this<00:05:16.690> boss

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
so I actually have not beaten this boss

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.010 
so I actually have not beaten this boss
yet<00:05:17.259> and<00:05:17.500> I'm<00:05:17.800> not<00:05:18.069> doing<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:18.520> great<00:05:18.669> so<00:05:18.970> far<00:05:19.240> so

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
yet and I'm not doing so great so far so

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:33.879 
yet and I'm not doing so great so far so
let's<00:05:20.259> we'll<00:05:20.770> see<00:05:21.009> how<00:05:21.130> this<00:05:21.250> goes

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.200 

so<00:05:34.400> it's<00:05:34.520> kind<00:05:34.669> of<00:05:34.699> cool<00:05:34.849> that<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:35.060> can

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
so it's kind of cool that you can

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.149 
so it's kind of cool that you can
actually<00:05:35.330> shoot<00:05:35.719> the<00:05:35.780> laser<00:05:36.349> beams<00:05:39.159> that's

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
actually shoot the laser beams that's

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.990 
actually shoot the laser beams that's
one<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.310> those<00:05:40.370> things<00:05:40.520> that<00:05:40.639> seems<00:05:40.819> a<00:05:40.969> bit

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
one of those things that seems a bit

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.450 
one of those things that seems a bit
unusual<00:05:41.240> -<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:42.080> wouldn't<00:05:42.889> necessarily<00:05:43.310> expect

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
unusual - I wouldn't necessarily expect

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.279 
unusual - I wouldn't necessarily expect
that<00:05:43.759> but<00:05:44.090> just<00:05:44.509> another<00:05:44.750> way<00:05:44.960> that<00:05:45.169> I<00:05:45.199> think

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
that but just another way that I think

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.800 
that but just another way that I think
this<00:05:45.560> game<00:05:45.889> is<00:05:45.919> is<00:05:46.340> it<00:05:46.699> accessible<00:05:47.449> you<00:05:47.689> know<00:05:47.719> I

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
this game is is it accessible you know I

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.089 
this game is is it accessible you know I
don't<00:05:48.050> think<00:05:48.229> it's<00:05:48.349> tremendously<00:05:48.830> difficult

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
don't think it's tremendously difficult

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.100 
don't think it's tremendously difficult
I'm<00:05:49.550> actually<00:05:49.789> did<00:05:50.060> ramp<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.449> difficulty

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
I'm actually did ramp the difficulty

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.429 
I'm actually did ramp the difficulty
back<00:05:51.439> a<00:05:51.710> bit<00:05:51.979> I<00:05:52.099> believe<00:05:53.020> it<00:05:54.020> starts<00:05:54.289> off<00:05:54.409> in

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
back a bit I believe it starts off in

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.110 
back a bit I believe it starts off in
Normal<00:05:54.800> Illinois<00:05:54.830> they<00:05:55.520> dropped<00:05:55.759> it<00:05:55.879> back<00:05:56.000> to

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
Normal Illinois they dropped it back to

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.580 
Normal Illinois they dropped it back to
easy<00:05:56.300> so<00:05:56.539> that<00:05:56.719> could<00:05:56.930> have<00:05:57.050> something<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.469> do

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
easy so that could have something to do

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.469 
easy so that could have something to do
with<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.800> fact<00:05:58.039> that<00:05:58.129> I'm<00:05:58.610> not<00:05:58.819> completely

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
with the fact that I'm not completely

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.740 
with the fact that I'm not completely
having<00:05:59.930> my<00:06:00.080> ass<00:06:00.469> handed<00:06:00.710> to<00:06:00.889> me<00:06:04.509> all<00:06:05.509> right
