00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it's probably Luke Skywalker's hand

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.080 
it's probably Luke Skywalker's hand
let's<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.340> him<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.880> they

Skywalker<00:01:48.509> who<00:01:48.750> apparently<00:01:48.930> hasn't<00:01:49.290> been

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
Skywalker who apparently hasn't been

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
Skywalker who apparently hasn't been
seen<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.979> 30<00:01:50.250> years<00:01:50.520> since<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> end<00:01:50.970> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
Return of the Jedi and along the way

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
Return of the Jedi and along the way
they<00:01:52.649> run<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:53.009> han<00:01:53.460> Solo<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.790> Chewbacca<00:01:53.939> I'm

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
they run into han Solo and Chewbacca I'm

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.569 
they run into han Solo and Chewbacca I'm
guessing<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.170> some<00:01:55.409> point<00:01:55.439> after<00:01:55.920> they

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
guessing that at some point after they

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.160 
guessing that at some point after they
meet<00:01:56.700> Han<00:01:56.880> Solo<00:01:57.270> han<00:01:57.479> sol<00:01:57.689> was<00:01:57.780> gonna<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
meet Han Solo han sol was gonna have to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.920 
meet Han Solo han sol was gonna have to
jump<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:58.770> something<00:01:59.430> because<00:02:00.299> Harrison

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
jump over something because Harrison

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.450 
jump over something because Harrison
Ford<00:02:01.170> broke<00:02:01.380> his<00:02:01.530> leg<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> I'm<00:02:02.100> guessing<00:02:02.430> that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
Ford broke his leg and I'm guessing that

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.740 
Ford broke his leg and I'm guessing that
he<00:02:02.729> probably<00:02:02.939> did<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.180> jumping<00:02:03.509> over

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
he probably did that jumping over

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.359 
he probably did that jumping over
something<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.469> crazy<00:02:04.680> speculation<00:02:05.310> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
something so just crazy speculation on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
something so just crazy speculation on
my<00:02:05.490> part<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.969> did<00:02:06.390> Han<00:02:06.540> Solo<00:02:06.810> might<00:02:07.020> be

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
my part there did Han Solo might be

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.859 
my part there did Han Solo might be
doing<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.560> jumping<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:08.099> episode<00:02:08.429> 7<00:02:08.869> anyway

John boyega plays a stormtrooper who's
kind<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.109> questioning<00:02:53.620> his<00:02:53.799> role<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
kind of questioning his role in the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.659 
kind of questioning his role in the
galaxy<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:57.099> I<00:02:57.159> guess<00:02:57.280> he's<00:02:57.430> kind<00:02:57.459> of

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
galaxy and I guess he's kind of

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:58.979 
galaxy and I guess he's kind of
abandoned<00:02:57.879> his<00:02:58.209> squad<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.689> that's<00:02:58.810> when<00:02:58.930> he

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
abandoned his squad and that's when he

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.089 
abandoned his squad and that's when he
meets<00:02:59.109> up<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.290> Daisy<00:02:59.530> Ridley<00:02:59.859> and<00:02:59.980> they're

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
meets up with Daisy Ridley and they're

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.750 
meets up with Daisy Ridley and they're
doing<00:03:00.250> whatever<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.519> hell<00:03:00.549> they're<00:03:00.700> doing

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
doing whatever the hell they're doing

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.539 
doing whatever the hell they're doing
meanwhile<00:03:01.269> there's<00:03:01.629> some<00:03:01.870> kind<00:03:02.109> of<00:03:02.310> bad<00:03:03.310> guys

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
meanwhile there's some kind of bad guys

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.580 
meanwhile there's some kind of bad guys
who<00:03:03.909> are<00:03:04.000> making<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.359> super<00:03:04.629> weapon<00:03:04.780> which<00:03:05.439> I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
who are making a super weapon which I

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.349 
who are making a super weapon which I
guess<00:03:05.739> can<00:03:05.950> destroy<00:03:06.280> entire<00:03:06.609> solar<00:03:06.939> systems

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
guess can destroy entire solar systems

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.869 
guess can destroy entire solar systems
as<00:03:07.480> opposed<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.680> planets<00:03:09.040> anyway

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
as opposed to just just planets anyway

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.979 
as opposed to just just planets anyway
we<00:03:10.000> don't<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.299> whole<00:03:10.540> lot<00:03:10.599> of<00:03:10.689> an<00:03:10.840> episode

7 this is all rumors and speculation in

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.309 
7 this is all rumors and speculation in
here<00:03:13.389> stay<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.599> take<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:13.959> with<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.139> grain<00:03:14.169> of

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
here stay so take it with a grain of

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.280 
here stay so take it with a grain of
salt<00:03:14.439> and<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.849> think<00:03:16.269> really<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.689> thing<00:03:16.870> that's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
salt and I think really the thing that's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.930 
salt and I think really the thing that's
important<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.650> keep<00:03:17.739> in<00:03:17.829> mind<00:03:17.889> is<00:03:18.129> December<00:03:18.549> 18

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940
