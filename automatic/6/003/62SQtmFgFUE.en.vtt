00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello everyone with you home 2013 and today i 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:12.719
 will continue to do homemade and started 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.269
 make alternative models 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.220
 hero factory recruitment 2014 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.180
 I mean, I took out my sets and tried 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 make some kind of dusty set of them and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.279
 so that no Circuits from 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.040
 one set left 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 for example disassembled his walker here with him 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 fifty one detail and tried exactly 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.239
 from all these 50 single parts to collect 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 some set 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.059
 that is, which model is alternative to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.960
 I have this set at the moment 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.050
 done 3 it's a walker bite it and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 monster and machine form 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.289
 consider first the walker I put it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.960
 here the jumper and the roof that jumpers 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.090
 I also need some kind of car and therefore I 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 how would put a jumper here 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 it seems to be keeping well and I thought 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.400
 why not by the way 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 walker here and here 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.380
 programs, that is, you can like a scene 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.049
 a battle to do this between a step and a move 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:30.500
 here they shoot this car 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:33.259
 many ponies have no Circuits by walker 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.210
 it did not remain after i did 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.470
 This set that is used exactly 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:46.940
 it is all to one detail and by the way here 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:49.149
 the structure of the frame so here it is like 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:58.130
 so here we move that is and 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:02:03.200
 rides here here so hands 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:08.720
 rises and falls all at once with us 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.110
 was the eldest here we saw in a circle 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.250
 fell out 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.600
 well, let's take it away while uncomfortable 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.549
 Well, in principle, so here it works either 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.720
 one detail . where have I not 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.720
 it remains only to do 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.430
 farther we go like u why monster 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:43.040
 wolf sochi monster I got here 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:47.160
 such a function of course 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.769
 well here so I did it like that 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.480
 That something like that is the front paws 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.560
 he is like that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.360
 transparent and back such here such 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.910
 like a spider any and only 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.380
 try 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.819
 the tail is exactly the body left 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.440
 so the same that is here here so 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.140
 the detail here is such a shell seems to me 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.500
 somehow even the set became somehow more 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.400
 probably what that bite monster who 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.480
 was original well, that is, as if personally 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.110
 me made by me 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 I liked the model, although I have something 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:38.400
 and how weird and well ahead 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.810
 machine parking machines form machine 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.900
 already according to the principle 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.590
 cars and the second half that is 4 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.019
 new no detail of the machine form is not 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.590
 left when i did this set neither 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.120
 one that is all 79 parts that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.269
 must be used 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.739
 they are all here, even here such here only 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.380
 which I thought for a long time where did I get her 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.540
 attach how would she hold 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.389
 a container so that it does not fall down there 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.410
 but the truth is he moves for days but it 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.690
 nothing the most important thing that keeps 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:22.340
 Now we have it here and so equipped 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.340
 so here's the fire swords and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.970
 but also I donâ€™t even know 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.640
 how can this car fly with these 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.770
 things well, so maybe they just 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.830
 will fire 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:42.080
 burn jumpers that is just me 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:47.540
 jump off so all the cabin opens 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.100
 ok knives and does not interfere 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.100
 we have this blaster 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.280
 here put fire extinguishers here 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.240
 such here understood the bottom detail here 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:05.000
 so here so here this particular 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:12.440
 covered too to eat too found 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.600
 application tables as if something 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.970
 still reminds car beam 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.050
 Well, how would I probably probably for 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.210
 these are the things on the paws 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.090
 in the back we all have such here though 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.340
 I think I did something wrong and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.520
 it was necessary to have these ahead but these 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.980
 back though it seems to me too 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.980
 as it is not very so but still 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:46.880
 an alternative model made well 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:50.480
 so here it is here and here even 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:56.450
 the camera doesn't even fit everything 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:58.330
 fit so clear all let then 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:04.210
 will lie 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:09.430
 but what about this all I will also continue 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:11.650
 do these homemade do on the car 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.810
 hand early machines lessons may have gone by 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:19.419
 the divider 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.669
 world 2013 subscribe to the channel put 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.539
 Like, I will be very pleased with all the luck 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.539
 and all bye
