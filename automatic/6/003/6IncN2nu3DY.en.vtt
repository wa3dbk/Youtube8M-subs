00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.380
 First of all 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.720
 Such as the Aso now of gold a day 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.579
 Sideways Are you doing a sequence 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:30.619
 Alico during this say to you are good to go in for home, but I say even this kind of movement thumb 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.619
 I'm doing this because I feel like it's easy to enter here in Nishi Ward 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.530
 last year's 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.530
 This year than summer 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.130
 Can't it be hot? 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.720
 today 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.270
 This is not enough this year than last summer 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:24.549
 This time I'm typing, this shore is called sc 05 d 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.549
 I'm doing this because I can type fenril 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.570
 It seems that even a small family misrecognized 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.940
 Oh dear 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.050
 With Nam Kana 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 You can also enter with your finger 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.540
 Hmm 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.490
 Well saying input 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.760
 Pretty smooth and attractive 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.450
 then 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 It comes to roughly any model input This is due to voice 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.340
 Speech recognition is 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.490
 Whether such blame or pick up the noise of the sound called microphone and mouth does not approach 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.550
 There is quite a lot of misrecognition 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.360
 I think I should go closer if possible 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.360
 I'm doing a little bit 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.870
 I can't get this year from last summer 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.360
 I have recognized that I can not finish this year when it is last year 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:32.700
 Well this kind of speech recognition is quite high recognition rate and 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.700
 It is quite early if you enter 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:42.700
 I recognize that even a long sentence is surprising , and if it is a good person with a slick tongue 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.740
 I think it will be stable and I will talk a little 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.400
 It often gets worse at once 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.769
 Yup 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.769
 Last summer good this year is not hot 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.030
 Before a little to get the Yappa is it this year last year of large festival funny 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.870
 It is a bit pointed out, but if it is recognized well, a little sweets 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.069
 After all one approaching 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.069
 Cognitive Caser rises 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.040
 As well used input 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.120
 Numeric input 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.380
 Mobile input I do it because this is often used 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.350
 Actually I am not good at this 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.150
 Not 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.150
 What kind of school board do you do? 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.620
 today 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.870
 It will show a final flick input 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.580
 Would you say earlier so from a little flick from the beginning 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.580
 I'll do from around're in non-land 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.440
 I'm riding today and can't get this week 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.700
 Was new and 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.460
 Well then 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.460
 I 'm doing something to do with my cell phone 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.850
 I'm sorry 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.850
 Good year 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.790
 It's too long already 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.840
 I am not good 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:16.680
 Isn't it the waist where teachers mix ? 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.680
 Well I could input in such a feeling 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.520
 I think that it is good to choose the most familiar input application 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.270
 Unexpected recommendations 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:34.650
 It is input by voice 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:35.280
 No higher is quite recognition rate especially high input towards not like is I recommend a little practice 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.560
 so 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.560
 When the human one of course is not known or a lot if I can not be just 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.380
 High 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:49.010
 I think it will be useful to use properly in the scene scene 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.010
 that's all
