like a mic and a viewfinder perfectly
fine<00:03:02.389> works<00:03:02.720> well<00:03:03.019> this<00:03:03.530> can<00:03:03.889> easily<00:03:04.189> take<00:03:04.340> it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
fine works well this can easily take it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.619 
fine works well this can easily take it
when<00:03:04.669> you're<00:03:04.790> kind<00:03:04.909> of<00:03:05.060> putting<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.329> side<00:03:05.510> to

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
when you're kind of putting a side to

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.030 
when you're kind of putting a side to
side<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.900> can<00:03:06.019> take<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.379> wait<00:03:06.620> probably<00:03:06.950> so

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
side it can take that wait probably so

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.349 
side it can take that wait probably so
it<00:03:07.129> doesn't<00:03:07.400> feel<00:03:07.489> like<00:03:07.549> it's<00:03:07.849> straining<00:03:08.239> I

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
it doesn't feel like it's straining I

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.449 
it doesn't feel like it's straining I
have<00:03:09.079> put<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.349> on<00:03:09.439> there<00:03:09.650> with<00:03:09.769> some<00:03:10.129> heavier

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
have put it on there with some heavier

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.240 
have put it on there with some heavier
stuff<00:03:10.760> like<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.389> tank<00:03:11.930> bit<00:03:12.620> couldn't<00:03:13.010> retail

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
stuff like the tank bit couldn't retail

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.830 
stuff like the tank bit couldn't retail
a<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.639> too<00:03:13.819> heavy<00:03:14.030> for<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.299> with<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.569> camera

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
a bit too heavy for that with the camera

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720 
a bit too heavy for that with the camera
stuff<00:03:15.049> so<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.379> wouldn't<00:03:15.799> advise<00:03:16.010> using<00:03:16.489> kind<00:03:16.639> of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
stuff so I wouldn't advise using kind of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.390 
stuff so I wouldn't advise using kind of
bigger<00:03:16.909> year<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.359> it<00:03:17.590> now<00:03:18.590> when<00:03:18.919> I<00:03:18.950> first<00:03:19.040> got

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
bigger year with it now when I first got

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.640 
bigger year with it now when I first got
this<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.879> with<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.629> ball<00:03:20.989> joint<00:03:21.260> here<00:03:21.470> which

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
this it with the ball joint here which

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.170 
this it with the ball joint here which
is<00:03:21.799> what<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.099> kind<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.340> use<00:03:22.459> for<00:03:22.639> the<00:03:22.699> suit<00:03:23.000> to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
is what you kind of use for the suit to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.309 
is what you kind of use for the suit to
get<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.449> to<00:03:23.659> move<00:03:23.810> around

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
get it to move around

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.469 
get it to move around
it<00:03:24.590> was<00:03:24.799> quite<00:03:25.069> stiff<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.970> does<00:03:26.239> come<00:03:26.449> with

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
it was quite stiff and it does come with

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.119 
it was quite stiff and it does come with
Alan<00:03:26.840> keister<00:03:27.229> unloosen<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.739> bit<00:03:27.889> but<00:03:28.010> it's

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
Alan keister unloosen a bit but it's

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.129 
Alan keister unloosen a bit but it's
really<00:03:28.370> hard<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.729> get<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:28.909> precise<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:29.959> what<00:03:30.109> I

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
really hard to get it precise so what I

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.839 
really hard to get it precise so what I
kind<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.409> think<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.010> good<00:03:31.129> idea<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.639> put

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
kind of think is the good idea is to put

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.460 
kind of think is the good idea is to put
a<00:03:31.879> bit<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.090> wore<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.449> there<00:03:32.599> bit<00:03:32.750> more<00:03:33.229> with

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
a bit of wore in there bit more with

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.469 
a bit of wore in there bit more with
some<00:03:33.620> soap<00:03:33.889> or<00:03:34.159> kind<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.459> put<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.609> bit<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.790> oil<00:03:35.269> in

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
some soap or kind of put a bit of oil in

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.030 
some soap or kind of put a bit of oil in
there<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.870> kind<00:03:36.379> of<00:03:36.440> get<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.769> be<00:03:36.859> a<00:03:36.889> bit

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
there to kind of get it to be a bit

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.710 
there to kind of get it to be a bit
smoother<00:03:37.459> but<00:03:37.609> once<00:03:38.239> you're<00:03:38.389> actually<00:03:38.599> using

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
smoother but once you're actually using

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.750 
smoother but once you're actually using
it<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.169> don't<00:03:39.409> really<00:03:39.560> notice<00:03:39.829> it<00:03:40.250> it's<00:03:40.579> only

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
it you don't really notice it it's only

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.129 
it you don't really notice it it's only
when<00:03:40.940> you're<00:03:41.030> kind<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.239> doing<00:03:41.449> slow<00:03:41.690> shot<00:03:41.930> if

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
when you're kind of doing slow shot if

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.330 
when you're kind of doing slow shot if
you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.409> I'm<00:03:42.470> moving<00:03:42.769> around<00:03:42.949> a<00:03:43.099> bit<00:03:43.220> like

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
you can I'm moving around a bit like

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.569 
you can I'm moving around a bit like
that

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
that

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.460 
that
Peverley<00:03:44.090> fine<00:03:44.389> but<00:03:44.569> when<00:03:44.659> you<00:03:44.750> kind<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:44.989> make

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
Peverley fine but when you kind of make

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.289 
Peverley fine but when you kind of make
it<00:03:45.500> slow<00:03:45.769> sometimes<00:03:46.069> it<00:03:46.400> can<00:03:46.519> creak<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
it slow sometimes it can creak but I

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.119 
it slow sometimes it can creak but I
only<00:03:47.629> found<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.139> star<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.560> using<00:03:48.889> it<00:03:49.010> and

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
only found that the star of using it and

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.149 
only found that the star of using it and
now<00:03:49.190> it's<00:03:49.489> perfectly<00:03:49.940> fine<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.919> yeah<00:03:51.919> that's

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
now it's perfectly fine so yeah that's

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.159 
now it's perfectly fine so yeah that's
my<00:03:52.250> review<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.819> would<00:03:53.239> definitely<00:03:53.930> say<00:03:54.139> the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
was a pleasure to be just holding this

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.330 
was a pleasure to be just holding this
and<00:04:09.349> stead<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.709> carrying<00:04:09.979> around<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.189> big

of just showing you the difference

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.159 
of just showing you the difference
between<00:04:15.199> handheld<00:04:15.949> and<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:17.570> easily

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
between handheld and this this easily

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.870 
between handheld and this this easily
looks<00:04:18.409> so<00:04:18.650> much<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.979> even<00:04:19.099> with<00:04:19.579> image

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
looks so much that even with image

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.540 
looks so much that even with image
stabilization<00:04:20.269> on<00:04:20.690> handheld<00:04:21.199> with<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.220> it

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550
