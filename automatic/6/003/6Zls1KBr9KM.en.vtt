 but we know the candy in the mouth because 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.160

 however today for the column but as a true one 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 that would be the column where I am 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.510
 I speak of the discoveries of beauty and not 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.239
 of the last period they made me 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.120
 say but really so all things 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 in short, they satisfied me 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:00.850
 somewhat and today I speak to you about this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.829
 oréal paris infallible 24 hours but 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:09.280
 this would be a bottom of you effect 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:13.679
 mart long held then this 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.090
 foundation obscured candy because 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:19.240
 this was I can't do two things in 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.729
 contemporary this foundation well here 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.229
 I bought it from soap and water and 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.920
 I paid 10 high-speed that is 10 euros 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:34.660
 I'm 35 ml I bought it in 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.020
 usual 22 beige and club raids 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.810
 then this is a bit slow 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.789
 very much discussed in the last period 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.690
 a lot has been talked about because a lot 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:50.190
 youtuber received it as a gift 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.640
 ie from the company and therefore the con 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.599
 reviewed and I instead show born buys 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.369
 anyway because it was a little 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.849
 intrigued then why the first 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.349
 version of this fund ten years 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.190
 years ago he didn't satisfy me for 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:11.950
 nothing maybe because I had the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.690
 you don't love them shines a lot on your face 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.060
 it seems god I had oiled myself in 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.470
 do not know but I think that because 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.990
 it was little the period of adolescence 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.830
 what when you have oily skin of 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:29.770
 bruschetta and goodnight anyway vi 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.780
 I talk about this 35ml 10 euros I like 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.780
 first of all I will swatch you 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.730
 processes are not mistaken 6 is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.950
 difficult to find a shade for those 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.710
 has a light skin like mine because 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.980
 almost all of them are slightly toned 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.490
 however darken then once applied in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.650
 face blends very well but here 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.960
 be careful when you choose the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.600
 hue to the product is this how 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.260
 you see this is a pretty shade 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.610
 clear that goes on the yellow and makes a lot 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.170
 my complexion to the touch is very sultry 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.150
 ie a little a lot if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.040
 being water based doesn't mean one 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.350
 crap but yes here is a water-based not 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.000
 as a dodge and was not a new foundation 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.040
 long seal effect mars that do not 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.709
 it will just shut off but you go to 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.690
 spread immediately you see comes immediately 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.300
 makes the skin homogeneous and immediately yes 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.239
 magnificent you see an effect in onid 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.920
 very silky and the good thing 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.250
 which surprised me because I said yes 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.160
 oh well this will surely make an effect 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.790
 mash on my tremendous face I wear it 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.580
 now for example you see from an effect 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.320
 however, porcelain skin is not that 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.769
 it is not annoying does not withdraw the skin 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.099
 how can I tell you 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:12.280
 from a cover here you see from one 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.950
 good silkiness coverage but it is not not 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.720
 it's heavy on the skin not from that sense 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.489
 of skin that does not breathe so I love it 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.830
 really got it all Saturday 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.100
 day but did a wrinkle me here 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.680
 shiny to die and with that it is not 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:37.240
 success this is almost surpassing the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.539
 the oreal this here that the names don't me them 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.000
 I almost never remember taking the place 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:53.710
 in my heart to the real I also said 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.770
 because I find them very similar though with 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.449
 this there is more coverage ie this here 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.509
 gives you more coverage vida skin of 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.220
 porcelain this is giving a 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.120
 kick the ass at this that is 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.120
 really becoming my foundation 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 favorite 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.650
 I really recommend it if you love me 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:22.900
 need a bit of news all day long 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:25.020
 on which you can count cosenza star 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.970
 via di rogerio could a bruschetta 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.520
 in short, going around if you want 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.770
 look for a foundation that gives an excellent 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.979
 performance especially if you have the 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.720
 oily skin and do not give it to you 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.669
 feeling of being discarded 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.680
 in my face I think this is for 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.949
 you now stupid to say that we are not 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:50.229
 talking about organic products but in any case for 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:52.360
 who seeks estate and does not take into account the 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.960
 bio this is really good fingers with 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.419
