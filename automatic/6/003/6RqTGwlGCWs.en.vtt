00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.360
 two 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.470
 two 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.570
 all right 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.279
 i 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 here the people here are here 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 here a boyfriend and this time we are here in 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.110
 our downloadable map and this time 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.759
 obviously from my fifth friend with me 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.520
 be your channel in the edition description 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.310
 gamer and then 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 let's see it let's see them this look and 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.650
 blogs that many know of who 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 speaks the truth that is not one of my 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.760
 preferred maps the truth that I do not 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 I like it a lot but it's very good 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 I really have to admit that he did it very 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.730
 good and good here is going to be four 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.730
 players 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.780
 here there will be a beauty come out flying 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.250
 ok well what I imagine many already 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.160
 they know the dynamics of the fire that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.020
 basically it's just pressing the button and 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.030
 be lucky to see that you touch 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.460
 example to remove with an under play and 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.190
 walk a path up 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.200
 be lucky to get things 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.690
 good for a final match between all 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.409
 the players can come good things 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.520
 bad things that can kill you 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.080
 many things the truth that is very 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.780
 funny as for example magical a 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.780
 spider and we're going to finish it 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.110
 speed 2 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.110
 maybe it has stuck to the green 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 I regret nothing here for example there is a 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.930
 labyrinth 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.420
 let's give it total 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.560
 a plate with diamond ore that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.250
 less canister with a peak iron 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.250
 we can look at it 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.620
 regeneration 2 here is a small 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.620
 parkour and lava 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.630
 and then we had it 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.640
 let's go here 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.440
 I do not want to end up without a cut to see a 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.640
 moment with the already for example of wood 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.640
 put back a 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.709
 or who puts a block and will say 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.900
 so that a game maze to not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.689
 burn 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.689
 and things like that because here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.749
 it's a very good map the truth 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.749
 as well 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.709
 but not my tastes but I'll still 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.910
 to leave for all regions in the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.770
 description so that they can be 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.840
 to download 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.250
 and then we're going to finish at the end 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.630
 dismiss the video for example already the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.450
 first for something good a sword of 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.180
 iron 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.180
 here we can eat eat cute 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.549
 a piston for nothing but touches things very 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.319
 great you can not play something good in 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.840
 something bad sometimes is something without utility 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.379
 for example a block of grass we should 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.379
 use that 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.420
 night vision 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.680
 they gave me another one 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.630
 or not 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.630
 they gave me an oven 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.040
 and here they give you 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.160
 ok that means that it's already here you have 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.780
 to fight with many do it 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.060
 Combat with things that have 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.870
 imposed people this is the map I hope 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.510
 like it and then and share the video 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.320
 if they want more maps of these people 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.320
 see you later 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.240
 do not
