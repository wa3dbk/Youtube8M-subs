00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
off of the frame in a large area so that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.940 
off of the frame in a large area so that

we don't cause damage to the door frame

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.630 
we don't cause damage to the door frame
itself<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.580> we<00:01:46.330> gently<00:01:46.690> prising<00:01:47.320> apart<00:01:47.650> to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
itself and we gently prising apart to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.490 
itself and we gently prising apart to
give<00:01:48.820> ourselves<00:01:48.970> quite<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.540> bit<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.930> room<00:01:50.140> to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
give ourselves quite a bit of room to

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.570 
give ourselves quite a bit of room to
actually<00:01:50.650> work<00:01:51.130> against<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.759> mechanism

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.880 

this<00:01:57.580> could<00:01:57.759> be<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.030> two<00:01:58.630> places<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.440> we<00:01:59.560> also

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
this could be to two places and we also

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.770 
this could be to two places and we also
work<00:02:00.190> around<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.729> handle<00:02:01.060> area<00:02:01.180> too<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.570> can

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
work around the handle area too you can

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.460 
work around the handle area too you can
see<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> large<00:02:06.310> gap<00:02:06.729> is<00:02:07.539> available<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.320> us

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
see that a large gap is available to us

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.100 
see that a large gap is available to us
to<00:02:09.160> actually<00:02:09.550> work<00:02:09.789> between<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.600> start

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
to actually work between and start

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.949 
to actually work between and start
working<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.860> mechanism<00:02:13.680> but<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:16.930> of

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
working on a mechanism but because of

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.070 
working on a mechanism but because of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
the pressure being spread evenly across

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.190 
the pressure being spread evenly across
the<00:02:20.440> width<00:02:20.590> door<00:02:21.519> spreader<00:02:22.200> there's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the width door spreader there's

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.740 
the width door spreader there's
absolutely<00:02:23.739> no<00:02:23.980> damage<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> frame<00:02:25.360> itself

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
absolutely no damage to the frame itself

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.620 
absolutely no damage to the frame itself
which<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.590> across<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.700> repair<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:28.450> you're

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
which is across the repair if you're

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.520 
which is across the repair if you're
working<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.989> time<00:02:29.290> versus<00:02:30.130> money<00:02:31.290> another<00:02:32.290> use
