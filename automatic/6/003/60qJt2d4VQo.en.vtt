00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
many of you guys know I use Squarespace

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.470 
many of you guys know I use Squarespace
for<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.350> jared<00:00:16.920> polin<00:00:17.369> comm<00:00:17.760> website<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.390> it's

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
for my jared polin comm website and it's

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.029 
for my jared polin comm website and it's
something<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.930> built<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.289> year<00:00:19.619> ago<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:19.949> it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
something that I built a year ago and it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.640 
something that I built a year ago and it
only<00:00:20.189> took<00:00:20.430> me<00:00:20.580> 30<00:00:20.910> minutes<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
only took me 30 minutes to do but the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950 
only took me 30 minutes to do but the
problem<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.550> haven't<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.390> touched<00:00:24.630> it

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
problem is I haven't really touched it

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.450 
problem is I haven't really touched it
in<00:00:25.109> almost<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.590> year<00:00:25.619> other<00:00:25.980> than<00:00:26.070> making

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
in almost a year other than making

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.339 
in almost a year other than making
simple<00:00:26.789> updates<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> photos<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.260> up

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
simple updates to the photos that are up

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.099 
simple updates to the photos that are up
there<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.849> using<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> full<00:00:30.750> power

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
there and I'm not using the full power

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
there and I'm not using the full power
of<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:32.070> Squarespace<00:00:32.610> gives<00:00:32.910> me<00:00:33.030> especially

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of what Squarespace gives me especially

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
of what Squarespace gives me especially
now<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.989> updated<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> Squarespace<00:00:35.070> 7

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
now that they updated to Squarespace 7

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
now that they updated to Squarespace 7
which<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.600> powerful<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.350> much<00:00:37.500> easier

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
which is more powerful and much easier

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
which is more powerful and much easier
to<00:00:38.040> use<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> started<00:00:39.600> looking<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> new

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
to use so I started looking for a new

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
to use so I started looking for a new
template<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.149> wels<00:00:42.420> template

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
template I was using the wels template

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.330 
template I was using the wels template
which<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:44.010> used<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
which is this is what you're used to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.090 
which is this is what you're used to
seeing<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.820> site<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.750> fine<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.500> simple

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
seeing on my site it's fine it's simple

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
seeing on my site it's fine it's simple
it<00:00:47.489> gets<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> job<00:00:48.840> done<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it gets it got the job done but then I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
it gets it got the job done but then I
was<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.860> oh<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.489> momentum<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.420> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
was like oh what is this momentum one so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.720 
was like oh what is this momentum one so
then<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.230> went<00:00:52.379> ahead<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.920> looked<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
then I went ahead and I looked at the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
then I went ahead and I looked at the
momentum<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.690> boom<00:00:56.300> much<00:00:57.300> better<00:00:58.100> now

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
momentum one and boom much better now

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.410 
momentum one and boom much better now
I'm<00:00:59.219> gonna<00:00:59.489> say<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.910> better<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.390> now

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
I'm gonna say it's much better right now

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
I'm gonna say it's much better right now

like that it moves now with the the
arrow<00:01:40.290> keys<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> keyboard<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
arrow keys on the on the keyboard I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.310 
arrow keys on the on the keyboard I
could<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> arrow<00:01:42.450> key<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> keyboard

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
could use the arrow key on the keyboard

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.260 
could use the arrow key on the keyboard
and<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:44.310> move<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.549> could<00:01:44.700> hit<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.030> on

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and that will move I could hit up on

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.580

something like that I'm gonna go home

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.540 
something like that I'm gonna go home
I'm<00:02:47.100> gonna<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> design<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.050> we<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:50.130> style

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
I'm gonna go to design and we got style

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.980 
I'm gonna go to design and we got style
editor<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:53.490> we<00:02:53.520> got<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.720> want<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
editor so we got that down and I want to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.170 
editor so we got that down and I want to
change<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.380> navigation<00:02:55.560> color<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.850> believe

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
change the navigation color so I believe

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.410 
change the navigation color so I believe
that<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:58.280> yes<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.580> there<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.240> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
that it's this one yes it is there it is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.960 
that it's this one yes it is there it is
so<00:03:00.810> navigator<00:03:01.470> navigation<00:03:02.340> color<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.790> could

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so navigator navigation color I could

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.180 
so navigator navigation color I could
make<00:03:03.240> it<00:03:03.360> red<00:03:03.630> obviously<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.709> could<00:03:04.950> make<00:03:05.070> it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
make it red obviously I could make it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.640 
make it red obviously I could make it
any<00:03:05.370> other<00:03:05.580> color<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> rainbow<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:07.590> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
any other color of the rainbow that I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.820 
any other color of the rainbow that I
would<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.360> case<00:03:09.570> let's<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:09.959> make

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
would like in this case let's just make

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.480 
would like in this case let's just make
it<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:11.070> darker<00:03:11.990> maroon<00:03:12.990> just<00:03:13.560> for<00:03:13.830> now<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
it a darker maroon just for now to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.390 
it a darker maroon just for now to
separate<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.570> see<00:03:15.870> how<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.290> have<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.340> hit

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
separate it so you see how I have to hit

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
separate it so you see how I have to hit
save<00:03:17.630> okay<00:03:18.630> Jared<00:03:19.140> hit<00:03:19.260> save<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.239> want

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
save okay Jared hit save and then I want

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.600 
save okay Jared hit save and then I want
to<00:03:21.510> go<00:03:21.660> out<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> design<00:03:22.980> function<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.580> that

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
to go out of the design function so that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.759 
to go out of the design function so that
it<00:03:23.730> works<00:03:23.970> fully<00:03:24.330> do<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.870> see<00:03:25.050> how<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.320> pops<00:03:25.560> up

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
it works fully do you see how it pops up

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.400 
it works fully do you see how it pops up
now<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.209> these<00:03:27.390> are<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.720> red<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.200> when<00:03:28.290> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
now so now these are in red and when it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.350
