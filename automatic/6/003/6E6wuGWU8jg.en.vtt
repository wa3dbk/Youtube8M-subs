 25 unix points 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:31.160
 Yaroslavl does not give up and the puck is somewhere there 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:34.320
 under her char himself and the game stopped 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.380
 carpenters 7 seconds 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.360
 have time to quit no no time intercepted 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.920

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.400
 johnson's attempts 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.680
 in general, everything was so close pretty 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.530
 but such is the standard 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.800
 Alexey Kruchinin forgot today in 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.800
 regular time his attempt after the match 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.190
