assignment we were given it was the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.209 
assignment we were given it was the
skimpiest<00:00:37.170> possible<00:00:37.620> thing<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.010> make

to like finish the that assignment maybe

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
to like finish the that assignment maybe
was<00:00:41.129> probably<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> save<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.809> your
