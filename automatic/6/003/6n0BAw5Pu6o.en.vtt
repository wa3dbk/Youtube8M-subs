00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.391

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.143
 So, Bambalou and Nopenny2000, I'll read the session Highlight 

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:26.407
 And you two are going to write it with your eyes closed! 

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:31.639

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:45.542

00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:52.990

00:00:57.525 --> 00:01:00.070
 looks like your favorite piece! 

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:06.693

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:22.721
 Hey Ninja, 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.528
 You recorded the episode. 

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:26.161
 of Breaking the Ice? 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.657
 So... 

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.241
 Ah what?! 

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.569
 #Breaking the ice 

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:34.273
 That's why Gary's inventions end in 3000. 

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:35.305
 Ah understood. 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.082
 Uh ... 

00:01:36.538 --> 00:01:41.818
 We were informed that a weather portal opened at the Snowy Fort. 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.754
 Our sources said subscribers using the jackhammer 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.216
 in the Snowy Fort they gain the Seal Builder. 

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:50.209
 Let's pause the race of pins 

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.155
 until next warning. 

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:54.876
 But we are solicitous people, so we are here to help. 

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:56.740
 Now the Ninja and the Riddick of the Day. 

00:01:56.778 --> 00:01:58.772
 Lunch is served where the music warns. 

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.724
 Find the pin on the eighth mark. 

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.756
 Um ... what's a beacon? 

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:06.324
 I do not know. I think that's why it's called charade. 

00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:10.395
 Dude, my igloo is not funny! How can I make it legal? 

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.401
 Hey, friend! I'm here to MEGGify your igloo! 

00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.321

 I know you like music, so I filled the igloo with DJ booths 

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:22.610
 Hmm... 

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:24.769
 Your igloo was MEGGnified! 

00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:28.825
 Primus2014 says: "how can 7 be even number?" 

00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:30.986
 -As? -Turning 1! 

00:02:31.058 --> 00:02:33.346
 Aaaaaaah 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.464
 Milbo1 wants to see us play Dance Contest in Extreme mode 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.650
 to see who wins. 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.653
 The winner is the coolest person! 

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:43.745
 Well, Ninja and Megg tried, so we'll see who's cooler! 

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.082
 WINNER! 

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.048
 Great party! 

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:57.880
 Yes, this sound is angry! 

00:02:58.057 --> 00:02:58.361
 Aaaiii! 

00:02:59.001 --> 00:02:59.864
 What is it ?!
