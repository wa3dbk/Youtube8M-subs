third<00:03:24.940> generation<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.959> takes<00:03:26.590> forever<00:03:26.829> to

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
third generation it takes forever to

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.210 
third generation it takes forever to
charge<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.239> up<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:28.799> something<00:03:29.799> that<00:03:29.829> you

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
charge it up so something that you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.699 
charge it up so something that you
should<00:03:30.579> think<00:03:30.880> about<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.169> want<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.470> charge

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
then dhaka - but that's used because

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.009
