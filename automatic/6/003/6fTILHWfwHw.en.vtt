00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it no I don't think so i think i mean we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
it no I don't think so i think i mean we
did<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.410> bit<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.590> testing<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.039> week

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
did a little bit of testing this week

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.439 
did a little bit of testing this week
because<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.579> think<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.030> learned<00:00:57.149> something

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
because we think we learned something

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.970 
because we think we learned something
last<00:00:57.570> weekend<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.230> seemed<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.770> last

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
last weekend and seemed like last

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
last weekend and seemed like last
weekend's<00:00:59.370> track<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.789> Anaheim<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> little

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
weekend's track at Anaheim was a little

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
weekend's track at Anaheim was a little
was<00:01:00.809> real<00:01:01.320> rough<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.100> talked<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:02.489> about

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
was real rough and I talked a lot about

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
was real rough and I talked a lot about
other<00:01:03.180> riders<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.259> said<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.649> kind

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
other riders and and they said the kind

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.410 
other riders and and they said the kind
of<00:01:05.009> same<00:01:05.129> thing<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> track<00:01:06.210> seemed

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
of same thing that the track seemed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.760 
of same thing that the track seemed
really<00:01:06.540> rough<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.110> almost<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.619> outdoor

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
really rough and almost like an outdoor

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219 
really rough and almost like an outdoor
so<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.760> set<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.390> settings<00:01:09.720> didn't<00:01:09.990> quite<00:01:10.080> work

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
so my set my settings didn't quite work

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
so my set my settings didn't quite work
that<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.369> did<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.520> testing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that well on it so we did some testing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
that well on it so we did some testing
this<00:01:12.000> week<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.990> sure<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> track

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
this week and I'm sure the track

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.719 
this week and I'm sure the track
conditions<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> quite<00:01:14.580> like

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
conditions are going to be quite like

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
conditions are going to be quite like
last<00:01:14.760> weekend<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.510> I<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.020> made<00:01:16.170> some

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
last weekend but I think we made some

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
last weekend but I think we made some
improvements<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> sand

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
improvements do you like the sand

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.890 
improvements do you like the sand
sections<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
sections they put in there one of the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.120 
sections they put in there one of the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this section over there might be a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
this section over there might be a
little<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.450> line<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
little one line because it's kind of a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.469
