00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 You could still basti animals through 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 turn the meat grinder so we need 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.930
 yes meat as cheap as possible 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.240
 still on 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.370
 We've had the battle we animals 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.280
 yes in Germany have 80 million 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.920
 People get fed that means we talk 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.680
 here of the big quantities 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 Weapons are great, yes we just stop that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.590
 makes a lot of work again 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.060
 elephant yes but I have a little bit now 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 Slaughterhouses seen for elephants 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
 besides that, probably 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.920
 other problems with the resolution 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.879
 with the slaughter orang utan evening yes 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 owns it from absolutely banned 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 just like the maturing cat food 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 they have the same with the monkeys 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.750
 very big problems would be constant 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.309
 let pass 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 80 I know that after the horse meat 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.809
 scandal, the Germans are deeply 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 unsure we want the trust 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.559
 restore in a great fresh 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.559
 Product comes in silver case when the on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.400
 and long ago 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.440
 they do not need to feed them anymore 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.440
 they're dead tonight 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 that was already out of tune 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.270
 Afterwards, we take the beef roulades and go out 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.270
 We make the beef steaks in the country 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.630
 from really honestly hard and only 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.729
 who would have lain down 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.709
 who in your opinion should he 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.719
 killed if a friendly ox or 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:44.689
 a deceitful drive in any case 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.100
 and if the horse should have bitten 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.509
 certainly makes his reason 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.720
 therefore, if someone something for what 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.349
 the poor animals and the 30 years in 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:06.319
 lausanne the things only the sick animals 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:10.879
 Do not harm the way to the pharmacy 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.879
 not from the medication 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.020
 the animal's beast is inviolable 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.360
 stayed promotion price and the version 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 or just fine 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.859
 I have it on every meat in it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.510
 if you could be open with it 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:42.180
 get around and says we do now have 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.319
 do not stop half and half and half 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.030
 which animal should be your opinion 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.030
 to be bolognese in the bovine 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.409
 who would have thought that trust in 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.170
 Horse meat is restored 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.889
 That are good News 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.889
