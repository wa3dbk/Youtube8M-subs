00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
light it and I heard that the more that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.870 
light it and I heard that the more that
it<00:00:59.789> lights<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:01.039> negativity<00:01:03.049> there<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
it lights the more negativity there is

you<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.420> string<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you know I have this string one here I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
you know I have this string one here I
don't<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.610> idea<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.000> light

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
don't think it's a good idea to light

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
don't think it's a good idea to light
this<00:01:09.630> drain<00:01:11.960> whoops<00:01:12.960> okay<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.950> traveling

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this drain whoops okay so my traveling

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.080 
this drain whoops okay so my traveling
the<00:01:14.490> string<00:01:14.820> part<00:01:15.090> yeah<00:01:15.930> yeah<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.409> don't

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
the string part yeah yeah so we don't

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
the string part yeah yeah so we don't
burn<00:01:18.090> ourselves<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> process

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
burn ourselves as well in the process

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.399 
burn ourselves as well in the process
but<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.430> light<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.290> it'll

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but you light it up like this and it'll

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.760 
but you light it up like this and it'll
create<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.920> smoke<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> like

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
create a smoke and then I kind of like

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
create a smoke and then I kind of like
to<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> around<00:01:26.509> my<00:01:27.509> own<00:01:27.750> body<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to put it around my own body just to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.830 
to put it around my own body just to
clear<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.909> negative<00:01:32.909> energies<00:01:33.420> or

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
clear all the negative energies or

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
clear all the negative energies or
anyone<00:01:34.409> else's<00:01:34.890> weird<00:01:35.159> energy<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.700> think

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
anyone else's weird energy I think

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
anyone else's weird energy I think
throughout<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> day<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.320> throughout<00:01:37.829> our

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
throughout the day and throughout our

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
throughout the day and throughout our
lifetime<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.110> communicate<00:01:40.350> with

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
lifetime you know as we communicate with

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.840 
lifetime you know as we communicate with
other<00:01:40.950> people<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:43.100> we<00:01:44.100> interact<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.700> other

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
people we just kind of pickup up their

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
people we just kind of pickup up their
energy<00:01:48.750> sometimes<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.100> good<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
energy sometimes in it's really good to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
energy sometimes in it's really good to
have<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:50.970> own<00:01:51.090> energy<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.899> help

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
have your own energy and this will help

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
have your own energy and this will help
restore<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.770> own<00:01:53.280> energy<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.240> help<00:01:54.540> clear

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
restore your own energy and help clear

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.990 
restore your own energy and help clear
away<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> weird<00:01:55.590> energies<00:01:56.130> around<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
away all the weird energies around so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.630 
away all the weird energies around so
then<00:01:57.210> you're<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.350> around<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:59.369> whole

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
then you're gonna go around your whole

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
then you're gonna go around your whole
space<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.420> whole<00:02:00.570> room<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.920> do

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
space like your whole room and just do

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.230 
space like your whole room and just do
it<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:04.200> ground<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:05.040> around<00:02:05.399> all<00:02:05.909> four

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it on the ground like around all four

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.609 
it on the ground like around all four
corners<00:02:06.979> maybe<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.250> top<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.379> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
corners maybe the top and then that's it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.450 
corners maybe the top and then that's it
I<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
I like to do it

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.510 
I like to do it
till<00:02:11.640> my<00:02:11.820> whole<00:02:12.000> room<00:02:12.240> get<00:02:12.510> smoky<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
till my whole room get smoky so here I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:34.840 
till my whole room get smoky so here I
go<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:27.380> all<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.560> way<00:02:28.620> around

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.750 

anyway<00:02:36.050> lost<00:02:37.050> fire<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.830> guess<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.490> means<00:02:38.610> that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
anyway lost fire I guess that means that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.030 
anyway lost fire I guess that means that
I<00:02:38.910> don't<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.780> much<00:02:40.410> negative<00:02:40.890> energy

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
I don't have that much negative energy

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.930 
I don't have that much negative energy
in<00:02:41.490> here<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.260> gonna<00:02:43.410> relight<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.940> and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
in here but I'm gonna relight it and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.590 
in here but I'm gonna relight it and
just<00:02:45.390> keep<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.240> also<00:02:48.360> do

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
just keep on going and you can also do

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.240 
just keep on going and you can also do
this<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:48.960> friends<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.470> yourself<00:02:49.530> and
