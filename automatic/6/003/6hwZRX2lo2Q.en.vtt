mugs<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.759> look<00:00:15.540> like<00:00:15.719> you're<00:00:15.929> drinking<00:00:16.289> beer

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
mugs that look like you're drinking beer

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.080 
mugs that look like you're drinking beer
but<00:00:16.710> really<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.460> liquid<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.029> I

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
but really it's just a liquid that I

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.820 
but really it's just a liquid that I
probably<00:00:18.420> would<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> guess<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.289> either<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
probably would have to guess is either a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.529 
probably would have to guess is either a
cooling<00:00:20.520> agent<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.910> know<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.150> keeps<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
cooling agent you know so that keeps the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
cooling agent you know so that keeps the
mug<00:00:21.750> cold<00:00:22.050> or<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.890> gimmicky<00:00:23.310> thing

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
mug cold or it's just a gimmicky thing

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.849 
mug cold or it's just a gimmicky thing
you<00:00:23.699> know<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.939> has<00:00:24.300> fluid<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.350> plastic

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you know it has fluid on in plastic

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.200 
you know it has fluid on in plastic
around<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.400> looks<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:26.970> beer<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
around so it looks like there's beer in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
around so it looks like there's beer in
it<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.599> probably<00:00:27.900> got<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.859> know<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it but it's not probably got you know a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
it but it's not probably got you know a
store<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:29.429> Spencer's<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.660> other<00:00:30.750> gag

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
store like Spencer's or some other gag

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.740 
store like Spencer's or some other gag
gift<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.380> maybe<00:00:31.560> hot<00:00:31.740> topic<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.219> something<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
gift or maybe hot topic or something and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
gift or maybe hot topic or something and
so<00:00:33.750> they're<00:00:34.170> walking<00:00:34.559> across<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.100> street<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
so they're walking across the street and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.720 
so they're walking across the street and
a<00:00:36.149> cop<00:00:36.360> season<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.899> pulls<00:00:37.050> him<00:00:37.260> over<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.730> I

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a cop season and pulls him over and I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110 
a cop season and pulls him over and I
just<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> comment<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.670> legal<00:00:41.670> issue

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
just want to comment on the legal issue

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.279 
just want to comment on the legal issue
at<00:00:42.930> hand<00:00:43.550> for<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:45.030> think<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> people's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
at hand for I think a lot of people's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.310 
at hand for I think a lot of people's
confusion<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> legal<00:00:48.809> issue<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.050> hand<00:00:49.079> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
confusion and the legal issue at hand is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
confusion and the legal issue at hand is
when<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> officers<00:00:49.920> saw<00:00:50.129> those<00:00:50.399> kids<00:00:50.700> with

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
when the officers saw those kids with

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
when the officers saw those kids with
the<00:00:51.510> beer<00:00:51.809> mugs<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.649> would<00:00:52.860> probably<00:00:53.129> be

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the beer mugs it would probably be

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.709 
the beer mugs it would probably be
enough<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> reasonable<00:00:54.239> suspicion

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
enough for a reasonable suspicion

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080 
enough for a reasonable suspicion
detention<00:00:55.260> at<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.890> least<00:00:56.100> technically

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
detention at the least technically

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.599 
detention at the least technically
speaking<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.680> open<00:00:59.010> container<00:00:59.340> law

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
speaking you know the open container law

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.240 
speaking you know the open container law
applies<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.410> underage<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
applies there they look underage and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.619 
applies there they look underage and
from<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.609> first<00:01:02.820> glance<00:01:03.059> an<00:01:03.239> officer<00:01:03.510> would

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
from a first glance an officer would

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.870 
from a first glance an officer would
probably<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.049> enough<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.790> know

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
probably have good enough you know

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
probably have good enough you know
reasonable<00:01:06.479> suspicion<00:01:07.049> level<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
reasonable suspicion level for a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880 
reasonable suspicion level for a
immediate<00:01:08.700> attention<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.439> at<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> point<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
immediate attention now at the point of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.480 
immediate attention now at the point of
detention<00:01:11.460> though<00:01:12.320> once<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.619> officer<00:01:14.159> saw

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
detention though once this officer saw

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
detention though once this officer saw
that<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.509> nothing<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:15.990> those<00:01:16.170> cups

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that there was nothing in those cups

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.270 
that there was nothing in those cups
that<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.280> empty<00:01:18.979> anything<00:01:19.979> she<00:01:20.130> had

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that it was just empty anything she had

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
that it was just empty anything she had
vanished<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.979> whatever<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.280> whatever

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
vanished so whatever you know whatever

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.429 
vanished so whatever you know whatever
suspicions<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> something<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
suspicions of something that it kind of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
suspicions of something that it kind of
stopped<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.580> her

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
stopped right there because her

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.289 
stopped right there because her
underlying<00:01:27.710> reason<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.740> detention<00:01:29.299> went

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
underlying reason for detention went

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.910 
underlying reason for detention went
away<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.380> she<00:01:31.500> came<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.799> the
