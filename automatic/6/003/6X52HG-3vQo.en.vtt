00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
when I play a trout game and I go and do

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.280 
when I play a trout game and I go and do
like<00:03:18.459> we<00:03:18.880> like<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:19.329> did<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.600> black<00:03:19.690> ops<00:03:19.930> 2<00:03:20.170> we

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
like we like we did with black ops 2 we

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.190 
like we like we did with black ops 2 we
went<00:03:20.410> into<00:03:21.000> most<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.180> maps<00:03:22.480> for<00:03:22.810> all<00:03:22.959> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
went into most of the maps for all the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.900 
went into most of the maps for all the
maps<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> we<00:03:23.829> found<00:03:24.070> quite<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.640> lot<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
maps and we found quite a lot of

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.349 
maps and we found quite a lot of
interesting<00:03:25.540> things<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:26.079> but<00:03:27.359> infinity

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
interesting things there but infinity

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.670 
interesting things there but infinity
war<00:03:28.480> games<00:03:28.750> obviously<00:03:29.049> there's<00:03:29.530> not

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
war games obviously there's not

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.979 
war games obviously there's not
particularly<00:03:30.280> anything<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.150> know<00:03:31.269> great<00:03:31.750> in

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
particularly anything you know great in

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.220 
particularly anything you know great in
them<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:33.100> mean<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.790> would<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.540> kill<00:03:34.720> them<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.140> at

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
them I mean I would it kill them to at

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.930 
them I mean I would it kill them to at
least<00:03:35.410> just<00:03:35.500> put<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.739> teddy<00:03:36.040> bear<00:03:36.130> someone<00:03:36.760> just

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.190 
least just put a teddy bear someone just
like<00:03:37.120> publicly<00:03:37.480> announced<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:37.959> there's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
like publicly announced that there's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
like a teddy bear in every single map

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.630 
like a teddy bear in every single map
because<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.269> can't<00:03:41.019> find<00:03:41.200> one<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.829> this<00:03:42.010> map<00:03:42.310> and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
because I can't find one in this map and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.390 
because I can't find one in this map and
if<00:03:42.790> there<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.060> one<00:03:43.269> brilliant<00:03:43.660> but<00:03:44.200> now<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.069> mean

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
if there is one brilliant but now I mean

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.490 
if there is one brilliant but now I mean
like<00:03:46.180> with<00:03:46.390> modern<00:03:46.630> warfare<00:03:46.780> 2<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.079> remember

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
like with modern warfare 2 I remember

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.559

I'm<00:03:47.769> not<00:03:47.920> sure<00:03:48.130> I've<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.790> wasn't<00:03:49.239> called<00:03:49.359> high

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
I'm not sure I've it wasn't called high

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.890 
I'm not sure I've it wasn't called high
rise<00:03:49.840> might<00:03:50.140> be<00:03:50.230> called<00:03:50.410> high<00:03:50.560> rise<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.720> one

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900

about on this map upsettingly
I<00:05:33.080> will<00:05:33.530> be<00:05:33.710> continuing<00:05:34.160> on<00:05:34.310> doing<00:05:34.730> every

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
I will be continuing on doing every

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.690 
I will be continuing on doing every
single<00:05:35.480> map<00:05:35.690> if<00:05:36.350> it<00:05:36.470> even<00:05:37.370> has<00:05:37.520> something

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
single map if it even has something

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.990 
single map if it even has something
remotely<00:05:38.270> interesting<00:05:39.110> on<00:05:39.230> it<00:05:39.380> but<00:05:39.950> um<00:05:40.190> as<00:05:40.430> for

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
remotely interesting on it but um as for

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.400 
remotely interesting on it but um as for
tremor<00:05:41.450> that's<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:42.020> so<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.140> think<00:05:42.230> you're

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
tremor that's it so I think you're

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.040 
tremor that's it so I think you're
forging<00:05:42.620> and
