00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.190
 that's how it should end after 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.219
 everything I 've done is really like that 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.490
 how everything should end and everything is for its 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.260
 guilt of who I thought was my friend all 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 began that day in which our 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
 paths crossed the day I was left 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.750
 in debt to her and I decided to accompany her 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.880
 the day he adopted me in those days a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.650
 bunch of strange beings of black color 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 and only one eye came to the area in the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.480
 who lived these creatures did not 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.629
 nothing but flying from one place to another 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 without any more reason since they arrived 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.210
 the pokemon in the area had started 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 act in strange ways me that night 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 I was walking as it was impossible 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.719
 sleep but on a tour I saw something 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 unusual a group of standards attacking 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.910
 to a small tree and from the shelves there 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 they are violent if they are not attacked so 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.579
 what to see them do something like that I stayed very 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.679
 Surprised 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.570
 The only thing I could think of doing was 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.909
 approaching to see what happened more to 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.610
 approaching the scene a bit there was something 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.310
 that left me petrified the eyes of the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.220
 shelves were completely white no 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.560
 they seemed to have life more that's not what 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.259
 They are worse began to attack them 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.360
 they barely saw me I barely managed 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.759
 escape from them but I was extremely 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.520
 hurt and I had no energy to return 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.799
 to my burrow I fell to the floor full of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.149
 open wounds and being completely 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.369
 vulnerable to some predator 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.700
 interested in my meat or a hunter 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.009
 interested in my skin when I woke up my 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.659
 surprise was infinite not only was 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.729
 I live but it was not in the same 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.610
 place where he remembered falling 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.920
 fainted the first thing I saw upon awakening 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.020
 it was a human young woman very similar to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.789
 that usually went to where 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.799
 they located my home 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.390
 this young woman had scratch injuries by 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.970
 his face and arms and a few 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.939
 slight burns more looked a beautiful 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.470
 smile seemed happy to see me 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.569
 awake 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.580
 apparently she found me in the 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.240
 darkness and rescued me from a pokemon 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.659
 wild 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.250
 I tried to brown, I was hurt 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.170
 He told me about the love he has for 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.959
 walkie money sees how scared to believe 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 that I could be dead too 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.650
 he talked about his dream of traveling the world 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.769
 next to the pokemon as their 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.690
 brothers had done it before her 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.140
 I who felt indebted to her 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.180
 I decided to accompany her to fulfill her dream 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 how ignorant I was if she loved the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.110
 Pokemon would not risk them to this class 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.590
 of dangers like the one we're in 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.470
 engaged now would not allow anything 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.230
 bad thing happened to us we would never have 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.989
 brought to this horrible place I'm 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.940
 deviating from the subject I must keep myself 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.090
 concentrated or the same will happen to me 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.090
 they should focus on something that 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 be already I know I will focus on how I got there 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.780
 here but where is this where is this 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.850
 terrible place where I am I find myself 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.760
 in the ruins at for a place to which 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 nobody should go I must remember how 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.690
 demons was that we live 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.820
 crystal my coach and I were a 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.010
 point to finish our trip by photo 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.710
 and we had planned to travel to sing by 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.620
 route 24 more we decided to take a 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.230
 rest in mauve city more no longer 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.060
 we were alone on the crystal trip and I 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.580
 we had become friends with many 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.460
 pokemon which now accompanied us 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.590
 in our adventure finally once in 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.240
 this city my coach saw a 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.730
 boy who did not stop talking about a 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.880
 strange ruins full of mysteries and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.530
 strange beings these ruins possessed 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.260
 mysteries beyond imagination 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.300
 secret rooms with strange messages 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.100
 all this added to a gloomy environment 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.650
 that produced an exciting 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.560
 Crystal chill saw the boy walk away 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.570
 after finishing his fantastic story my 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.820
 trainer was amazed with the 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.670
 ruins so he decided to follow the boy 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.040
 towards the ruins after half an hour 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.340
 of walk we reached the ruins in 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.920
 question surprisingly it did not cost us 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.810
 be at the site at all 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.090
 problem was at the time of entering 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.260
 the ruins since the aura that is there 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.790
 I felt it was dark 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.120
 and dark 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.280
 added to this strange sounds 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.650
 distorted they left the ruins 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.539
 warning the curious not to enter 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.400
 more all this did not seem to matter to 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.770
 crystal probably not even 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.740
 I was aware of what he was doing as 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.930
 who entered the ruins without hesitation 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.060
 I knew it was a bad idea to go in there more 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.979
 I also knew that crystal would not go back 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.400
 back until you find the emotion that 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.470
 I was looking for that stubborn girl I finally committed the 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.650
 mistake to follow her to follow her to this death 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.110
 sure that it approaches me we advance by 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.270
 the corridors of the ruins and next to 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.800
 an unconscious crystal which does not 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.070
 it showed traces of emotion or 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.349
 thought some crystal seemed to be 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.509
 following something crossing the track I managed 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.720
 identify a dark being floating around 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.849
 meters later than us that set 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.620
 it was strangely similar to those that 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.830
 they were near my home the night that 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.080
 I met crystal, we followed that creature 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.210
 for a few minutes finding us in 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.490
 the road with many identical beings to 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.700
 which they limited him to observe 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.740
 with deep red eyes 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.420
 or so it was until we came to a 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.310
 dark room covered in blood and 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.910
 symbols similar to those creatures 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.070
 but drawn in red the being that 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.230
 we were following he stopped he looked at the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.080
 eyes to glass and this one seemed to come out of 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.660
 a trance looked surprised at the creature 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.720
 and without hesitation he threw crowley to the 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.030
 battle but something strange happened this time 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.830
 the eyes of grow light lit up 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.800
 a red color and was thrown against 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.140
 our five long minutes we were 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.320
 fleeing from a friend who surprisingly 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.510
 He decided to attack us by more than glass 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.630
 I would like to return it to he knew that dance was 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.520
 impossible no longer belonged to him it was not 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.590
 but until I manage to stop to grow light 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.980
 with an accurate bite attack that stopped 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.230
 of attacking us crystal was doubtful of itself 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.440
 will send another pokemon but the penetrating 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.660
 look of the dark being forced her world 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.850
 a faithful friend of ours who we met almost 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.320
 at the beginning of the trip was the one sent to 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.990
 fight 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.230
 the instant he touched the floor he started 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.620
 shine was evolving crystal it 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.960
 it moved but something did not smell good to me 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.370
 world now a world let me escape a 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.400
 scream of pain after finishing 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.440
 evolve began to undernourish 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.520
 stay in the bones and subsequently 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.950
 to become crystal dust was crying 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.170
 I had just seen a great friend die more 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.880
 the creatures did not stop posed their 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.890
 look at me and they try to put me in 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.900
 against my coach doing me 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.150
 believe that she brought me here apropos 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.360
 washing my brain and if they can not 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.310
 they will eliminate me as I deepened that is the 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.130
 destiny of who enters the ruins at 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.530
 for this is the destiny of who for 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.110
 sheer curiosity decides to enter this 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.140
 damn place more I will not go without 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.970
 fight I will protect my teacher until I give 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.590
 the last scream because I have a 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.590
 heart of burning flames
