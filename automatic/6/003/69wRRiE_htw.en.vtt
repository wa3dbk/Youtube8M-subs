00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.859 

and<00:00:16.830> your<00:00:17.190> point<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:19.020> basically<00:00:19.910> as<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.750> know

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and your point so basically as you know

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.140 
and your point so basically as you know
I'm<00:00:22.020> doing<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.710> kind<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> clicking<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.939> my

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I'm doing that kind of clicking with my

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.870 
I'm doing that kind of clicking with my
right<00:00:24.510> hand<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:28.050> maybe<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.740> pattern<00:00:29.130> won't

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
right hand so maybe this pattern won't

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669 
right hand so maybe this pattern won't
be<00:00:30.090> something<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> use<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> full

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
be something that I use with the full

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.650 
be something that I use with the full
band<00:00:33.980> just<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.340> yeah<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.540> own

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
band just because yeah you have your own

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.040 
band just because yeah you have your own
percussion<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.579> hand<00:00:39.050> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
percussion going with your hand you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479 
percussion going with your hand you
don't<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> interfere<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.160> drum<00:00:41.370> or

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
don't want to interfere with the drum or

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180 
don't want to interfere with the drum or
anything<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.899> pattern<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.950> cool

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
anything so this pattern would be cool

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.299 
anything so this pattern would be cool
if<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.329> playing<00:00:45.629> without<00:00:46.469> drums<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> bass

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
if you're playing without drums and bass

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.010 
if you're playing without drums and bass
and<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.210> you're<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.360> playing<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.899> another

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and if you're just playing with another

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.040 
and if you're just playing with another
guitarist<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.980> something<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> basically<00:00:54.050> I'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
guitarist or something so basically I'll

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.000 
guitarist or something so basically I'll
do<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.500> best<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.280> show<00:00:56.449> how<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> play<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.010> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
do my best to show how to play this and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
do my best to show how to play this and
I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.210> by<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.449> sticking

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I think I can do that by just sticking

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
I think I can do that by just sticking
to<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.500> chord<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> playing<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> pattern

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to one chord and playing the pattern

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
to one chord and playing the pattern
really<00:01:03.840> slowly

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
really slowly

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.250 
really slowly
and<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:07.140> recommend<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:09.260> just

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and I recommend that you just just

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.219 
and I recommend that you just just
listen<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.460> couple<00:01:12.360> times<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.170> then

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
listen to it a couple times and then

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130 
listen to it a couple times and then
eventually<00:01:13.560> start<00:01:14.570> trying<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> come<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
eventually start trying to come in and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.280 
eventually start trying to come in and
start<00:01:16.380> playing<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> along<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.850> me<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.290> here's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
start playing it along with me so here's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
start playing it along with me so here's
the<00:01:19.500> pattern<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.400> minor<00:01:20.640> seventh<00:01:21.060> chord

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the pattern on an a minor seventh chord

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
the pattern on an a minor seventh chord
and<00:01:23.210> I'm<00:01:24.210> sure<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> notice<00:01:24.810> already<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.290> for

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and I'm sure you notice already but for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.469 
and I'm sure you notice already but for
these<00:01:26.610> bossa<00:01:26.880> patterns<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
these bossa patterns you want to

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
these bossa patterns you want to
alternate<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> 1<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.970> 3<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
alternate the 1 and the 3 so you want to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.499 
alternate the 1 and the 3 so you want to
play<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> 1<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> string<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
play the 1 on the a string and then the

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
play the 1 on the a string and then the
third<00:01:39.509> note<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> measure<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.579> E

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
third note of the measure on the E

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.300 
third note of the measure on the E
string<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.170> want<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> keep<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
string so you want to keep this in the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.220 
string so you want to keep this in the
baseline

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.630 

that<00:01:49.230> that's<00:01:49.470> gonna<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.830> going<00:01:50.100> throughout

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that that's gonna be going throughout

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.890 
that that's gonna be going throughout
the<00:01:50.760> whole<00:01:50.970> song<00:01:51.120> that's<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.720> your

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
the whole song that's that's your

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.440 
the whole song that's that's your
baseline<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> here's<00:01:53.850> how<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> play<00:01:54.240> this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
baseline so here's how to play this

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:18.170 
baseline so here's how to play this
pattern<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.900> slowly<00:02:16.310> alright<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
pattern really slowly alright so if you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.740 
pattern really slowly alright so if you
didn't<00:02:18.390> get<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.540> from<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.430> recording<00:02:20.430> just

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
didn't get that from that recording just

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.120 
didn't get that from that recording just
rewind<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:24.260> eventually<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.770> know<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> can

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
rewind and eventually you know you can

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.310 
rewind and eventually you know you can
apply<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.900> tunes

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
apply this to tunes

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:46.280 
apply this to tunes
let's<00:02:28.680> take<00:02:28.890> blue<00:02:29.130> basa<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.600> no<00:02:45.600> encores<00:02:46.080> like

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
let's take blue basa and no encores like

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.160 
let's take blue basa and no encores like
this<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.820> alternate<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> bass<00:02:48.900> line

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
this just alternate the bass line

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
this just alternate the bass line
between<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:50.220> root<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> fifth<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.430> that's

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
between the root and the fifth so that's

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.440 
between the root and the fifth so that's
the<00:02:53.820> one<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.720> three<00:02:55.350> four<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.519> two<00:02:56.940> three

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
the one two three four one two three

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.090 
the one two three four one two three
four<00:02:58.580> just<00:02:59.580> keep<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.910> in<00:02:59.970> mind
