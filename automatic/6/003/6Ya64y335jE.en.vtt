00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
about seven eight years old I had to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.649 
about seven eight years old I had to
explain<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.760> him<00:00:45.879> that<00:00:45.909> it<00:00:46.150> would<00:00:46.239> be<00:00:46.360> okay

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
that his dad had just left and I

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.549 
that his dad had just left and I
realized<00:00:49.510> at<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.720> moment<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:50.229> some

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
realized at that moment that some

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.369 
realized at that moment that some
children's<00:00:50.979> lives<00:00:51.250> are<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:52.690> difficult<00:00:53.199> and

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
children's lives are more difficult and

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.439 
children's lives are more difficult and
they<00:00:53.559> bear<00:00:53.799> more<00:00:54.100> weight<00:00:54.370> on<00:00:55.269> their<00:00:55.420> shoulders

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
they bear more weight on their shoulders

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.719 
they bear more weight on their shoulders
than<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:56.080> probably<00:00:56.260> ever<00:00:56.589> will<00:00:56.739> even<00:00:57.580> though<00:00:57.699> I

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
than I probably ever will even though I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.399 
than I probably ever will even though I
was<00:00:57.909> already<00:00:58.120> an<00:00:58.299> adult<00:00:58.479> and<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.110> was<00:00:59.229> very

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
was already an adult and it was very

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.610 
was already an adult and it was very
humbling<00:00:59.530> I<00:01:00.120> came<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.239> appreciate<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.930> many

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
humbling I came to appreciate that many
