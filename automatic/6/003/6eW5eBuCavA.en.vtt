00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
place to put all stuff so who's starting

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.460 
place to put all stuff so who's starting
to<00:00:04.650> build<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:06.029> shipping<00:00:06.540> container<00:00:06.960> camp<00:00:07.259> to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
to build this shipping container camp to

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.259 
to build this shipping container camp to
start<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.040> when<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.880> see<00:00:08.940> shipping

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
start that when you see shipping

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.799 
start that when you see shipping
containers<00:00:09.870> as<00:00:10.110> shots<00:00:10.910> story<00:00:11.910> well<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
containers as shots story well as the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.400 
containers as shots story well as the
mobile<00:00:13.530> device<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:14.009> tickets<00:00:15.049> so<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.199> were

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
mobile device for tickets so we were

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:27.589 
mobile device for tickets so we were
really<00:00:16.529> proud<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.640> idea<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.270> set<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:26.599> got

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
really proud as idea was set up and got

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
really proud as idea was set up and got
in<00:00:27.779> about<00:00:27.900> three<00:00:28.230> months<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> Berkeley

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
in about three months and Berkeley

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.259 
in about three months and Berkeley
decided<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:29.609> weren't<00:00:29.789> particularly

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
decided they weren't particularly

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
decided they weren't particularly
excited<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.380> idea<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.460> make

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
excited about this idea that we make

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.139 
excited about this idea that we make
paper<00:00:32.989> associated<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.550> thought<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.850> we

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
paper associated so we thought that we

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.930 
paper associated so we thought that we
read<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:37.590> read<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.800> zoning<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> those

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
read that we read the zoning and those

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
read that we read the zoning and those
stuff<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.450> thought<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.780> could<00:00:39.809> slide<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> as

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
stuff we thought we could slide it in as

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.220 
stuff we thought we could slide it in as
a<00:00:40.910> temporary<00:00:41.910> buildings<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.660> construction

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
a temporary buildings of construction

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.369 
a temporary buildings of construction
type<00:00:43.860> scenario<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.300> decided<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.050> we

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
type scenario and they decided that we

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.020 
type scenario and they decided that we
were<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.710> real<00:00:47.039> internet<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:48.980> real

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
were a real internet was real

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:00.889 
were a real internet was real
application<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:55.070> fundamental<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:59.899> so

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
application and fundamental there so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.889 
application and fundamental there so
they're<00:01:01.079> responsible<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> show<00:01:01.829> how<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.539> three

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
they're responsible to show how so three

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.109 
they're responsible to show how so three
months<00:01:04.110> ago<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.409> fantastic<00:01:05.129> artist<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> we

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
months ago a fantastic artist and we

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.030 
months ago a fantastic artist and we
decided<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.780> were<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> continue

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
decided we were going to continue

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.330 
decided we were going to continue
in<00:01:12.370> fact<00:01:12.700> I'm<00:01:13.570> door<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:16.090> started<00:01:16.960> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
in fact I'm door so that started a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780 
in fact I'm door so that started a
seven-year<00:01:18.660> journey<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:20.190> power<00:01:21.190> engineering

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
seven-year journey of power engineering

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.900 
seven-year journey of power engineering
we<00:01:22.780> ended<00:01:23.110> up<00:01:23.230> building<00:01:23.590> an<00:01:23.980> off-grid<00:01:24.310> power

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
we ended up building an off-grid power

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.930 
we ended up building an off-grid power
system<00:01:25.600> here<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:27.010> ran<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:27.430> facility

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
system here that we ran this facility

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.420 
system here that we ran this facility
actually<00:01:28.270> ran<00:01:28.600> off<00:01:29.050> with<00:01:29.590> five<00:01:29.950> or<00:01:30.130> six<00:01:30.310> years

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
actually ran off with five or six years

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.480 
actually ran off with five or six years
we<00:01:31.390> were<00:01:31.630> generating<00:01:32.140> power<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.770> level<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.340> we

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
we were generating power a level that we

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.910 
we were generating power a level that we
could<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:34.720> all<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:34.990> ladies<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.620> medals

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
could when all the ladies and medals

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.640 
could when all the ladies and medals
well<00:01:36.580> we're<00:01:36.790> seeing<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.360> room<00:01:37.630> over<00:01:37.870> here<00:01:37.900> we

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
phase so that was our pool in our

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.790 
phase so that was our pool in our
delivery<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.300> started<00:02:34.630> experimenting<00:02:35.440> with

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
delivery we started experimenting with

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.000 
delivery we started experimenting with
how<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.610> feel<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.210> way<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:38.650> have<00:02:38.740> bio

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
how I feel this way so we have bio

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.910 
how I feel this way so we have bio

playing<00:02:42.160> TV<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.590> as<00:02:44.590> they<00:02:45.209> got<00:02:46.209> frustrated

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
playing TV and as they got frustrated

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.630 
playing TV and as they got frustrated
with<00:02:46.870> realities<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.380> their<00:02:47.740> logistics<00:02:48.520> and
