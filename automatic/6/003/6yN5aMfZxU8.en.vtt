it<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.520> this<00:02:39.640> case<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:40.030> could<00:02:40.150> still<00:02:40.360> do

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
it but in this case you could still do

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.790 
it but in this case you could still do
it<00:02:40.510> in-game<00:02:40.750> because<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.410> have<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.590> visual

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
it in-game because you have a visual

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.080 
it in-game because you have a visual
screen<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.340> do<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:43.260> also<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:44.770> have<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.340> number

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
screen to do it on also we have a number

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.850 
screen to do it on also we have a number
pad<00:02:46.420> which<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.840> something<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.470> most

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
pad which is something that most

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.280 
pad which is something that most
keyboards<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.760> one<00:02:48.910> is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
keyboards have but this one is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.440 
keyboards have but this one is
integrated<00:02:50.290> directly<00:02:50.440> into<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.760> actual<00:02:52.180> UI

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
integrated directly into the actual UI

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.150 
integrated directly into the actual UI
so<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> same<00:02:53.560> kind<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.800> interface

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
so you have the same kind of interface

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.120 
so you have the same kind of interface
there<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.820> then<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.750> trackpad<00:02:56.200> mode<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.070> you

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
there and then a trackpad mode so you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.460 
there and then a trackpad mode so you
can<00:02:57.250> use<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.550> with<00:02:57.790> or<00:02:58.000> without<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.300> mouse<00:02:59.790> yes

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can use this with or without a mouse yes

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.080 
can use this with or without a mouse yes

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
maybe a blue-footed that's how I would

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.650 
maybe a blue-footed that's how I would
set<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.340> move<00:04:26.580> for<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.790> light<00:04:26.970> grant<00:04:27.540> for

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
set it up move for the light grant for

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:38.610 
set it up move for the light grant for
the<00:04:27.720> dark<00:04:27.930> yeah<00:04:28.230> mines<00:04:28.530> always<00:04:28.860> ready

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.119 

would<00:04:38.919> there<00:04:39.099> be<00:04:39.129> a<00:04:39.309> way<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.809> set<00:04:40.809> it<00:04:40.919> for<00:04:41.919> if

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
would there be a way to set it for if

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.399 
would there be a way to set it for if
you<00:04:42.309> progressively<00:04:42.849> decide<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.389> go<00:04:43.569> down<00:04:43.960> one

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
you progressively decide to go down one

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.339 
you progressively decide to go down one
route<00:04:44.620> or<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.889> other<00:04:45.039> it<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.909> gets<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.749> pulses

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
route or the other it it gets it pulses

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.980 
route or the other it it gets it pulses
deeper<00:04:47.800> in<00:04:48.189> that<00:04:48.249> color<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:49.029> lot<00:04:49.270> of<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.509> actual

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
deeper in that color a lot of the actual

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.469 
deeper in that color a lot of the actual
like<00:04:50.169> gate<00:04:50.409> the<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:51.159> color<00:04:51.849> integration<00:04:52.360> that

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
like gate the the color integration that

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.179 
like gate the the color integration that
kind<00:04:52.689> of<00:04:52.719> stuff<00:04:52.900> is<00:04:52.990> done<00:04:53.169> by<00:04:53.379> a<00:04:53.409> by<00:04:53.949> where
