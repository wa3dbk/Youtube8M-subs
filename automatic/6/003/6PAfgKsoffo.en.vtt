it's the battery or something that's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.430 
it's the battery or something that's
probably<00:04:22.520> pretty<00:04:22.790> damn<00:04:23.150> toxic<00:04:25.810> look<00:04:26.810> at<00:04:27.020> that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
probably pretty damn toxic look at that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.080 
probably pretty damn toxic look at that
I<00:04:30.670> think<00:04:31.670> it's<00:04:31.820> game<00:04:32.060> over<00:04:32.390> on<00:04:32.540> this<00:04:32.690> thing

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
I think it's game over on this thing

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.090 
I think it's game over on this thing
that<00:04:35.090> glass<00:04:35.870> or<00:04:36.140> plastic<00:04:36.290> whatever<00:04:36.800> they<00:04:36.920> used
