there<00:04:41.700> are<00:04:41.850> people<00:04:42.150> who<00:04:42.240> will<00:04:42.420> buy<00:04:42.570> into<00:04:42.930> it

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
there are people who will buy into it

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.390 
there are people who will buy into it
there<00:04:43.200> are<00:04:43.290> people<00:04:43.560> who<00:04:43.680> will<00:04:43.890> pay<00:04:44.070> for<00:04:44.310> this

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
and also if you have cut down anywhere

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.790 
and also if you have cut down anywhere
near<00:05:39.090> contest<00:05:39.660> lane<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.380> you're<00:05:40.500> not<00:05:40.680> on

near contest lane and you're not on
drugs<00:05:41.070> to<00:05:41.460> sustain<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:42.090> you<00:05:42.540> probably

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
drugs to sustain that you probably

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.020 
drugs to sustain that you probably
shouldn't<00:05:43.650> try<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:43.890> sustain<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.520> ultra<00:05:44.880> low

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
shouldn't try to sustain that ultra low

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.490 
shouldn't try to sustain that ultra low
body<00:05:45.210> fat<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:45.720> shouldn't<00:05:46.110> even<00:05:46.230> be<00:05:46.380> doing

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
body fat so you shouldn't even be doing

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.050 
body fat so you shouldn't even be doing
this<00:05:46.620> type<00:05:46.920> of<00:05:46.950> reverse<00:05:47.280> you<00:05:47.460> probably<00:05:47.820> need

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
this type of reverse you probably need

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.490 
this type of reverse you probably need
to<00:05:48.150> gain<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.330> little<00:05:48.540> bit<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:48.810> body<00:05:48.930> fat<00:05:49.230> for

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
to gain a little bit of body fat for

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.220 
to gain a little bit of body fat for
your<00:05:49.620> own<00:05:49.800> hormonal<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:51.020> physical<00:05:52.020> health

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
your own hormonal and physical health

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.100 
your own hormonal and physical health
but<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.820> fact<00:05:54.030> is<00:05:54.150> if<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.450> reversed<00:05:54.750> out<00:05:54.930> the

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
but the fact is if you reversed out the

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.600 
but the fact is if you reversed out the
way<00:05:55.230> i<00:05:55.260> just<00:05:55.380> described<00:05:55.980> it<00:05:56.100> you're<00:05:56.220> not<00:05:56.400> going

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
way i just described it you're not going

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.270 
way i just described it you're not going
to<00:05:56.700> gain<00:05:56.820> body<00:05:57.060> fat<00:05:57.330> you're<00:05:57.510> going<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:57.750> regain

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
to gain body fat you're going to regain

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.890 
to gain body fat you're going to regain
water<00:05:59.280> weight<00:05:59.610> and<00:05:59.850> you<00:05:59.940> might<00:06:00.150> look<00:06:00.510> like<00:06:00.570> you

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
water weight and you might look like you

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.240 
water weight and you might look like you
gained<00:06:01.110> a<00:06:01.230> little<00:06:01.440> fat<00:06:01.650> but<00:06:01.890> it's<00:06:02.010> just

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
gained a little fat but it's just

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.040 
gained a little fat but it's just
regaining<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.820> water<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.450> you've<00:06:03.600> lost<00:06:03.810> by

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
regaining the water that you've lost by

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.660 
regaining the water that you've lost by
maintaining<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.680> deficit<00:06:05.160> is<00:06:05.280> just<00:06:05.490> the

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
maintaining that deficit is just the

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.210 
maintaining that deficit is just the
nature<00:06:05.910> of<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.300> beast<00:06:06.590> it<00:06:07.590> doesn't<00:06:08.040> mean<00:06:08.190> that

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
nature of the beast it doesn't mean that

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.770 
nature of the beast it doesn't mean that
you've<00:06:08.460> gained<00:06:08.670> tissue<00:06:08.970> eight<00:06:09.240> in<00:06:09.330> effect<00:06:09.630> if

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
you've gained tissue eight in effect if

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.330 
you've gained tissue eight in effect if
you<00:06:09.870> go<00:06:09.990> check<00:06:10.200> your<00:06:10.320> skin<00:06:10.590> folds<00:06:10.980> you<00:06:11.100> get<00:06:11.220> add

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
extra skin you're going to find that it

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.270 
extra skin you're going to find that it
actually<00:06:12.960> hasn't<00:06:13.320> increased<00:06:13.740> your<00:06:14.010> skin
