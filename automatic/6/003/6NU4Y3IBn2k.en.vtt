00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.060
 Yes today is this 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.060
 I would like to introduce Ospress 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 The contents are the pos press body, one gate card and one ability card. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.310
 The gate card 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 Jack point is feeling of now 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:38.739
 A kappa of strengthening the Tteyuu sub Rokubakku Oh +400 El darkness attribute is something 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.739
 It is feeling of the gate of kappa 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.040
 The ability is a bullet technique dedicated to stress 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 If you can shoot up to 4 times 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.600
 When stan is done and it is the end 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.600
 It is critical that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.430
 Is that mean that you will be able to make a critical Chun meeting? 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.379
 It is a card that looks hungry or strong 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.210
 Osu play It is such a feeling 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.560
 It rubs in like Bali day temperature, but 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.320
 Oh the end will be Ribion 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.850
 Something like this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.940
 Barry Pyon has gone around, but the press is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.360
 No koga 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.990
 In order to that path press it looks like it is thin 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.950
 Open 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.950
 Something like this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.290
 It's quite low, it's like the feeling of a white rattan seat 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.190
 Nde this view to follow up 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.180
 There is quite an offensive power in such an old man around 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.180
 Power level too 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.450
 It is quite high with 710 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.450
 I would like to actually use it 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.260
 Something like this 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.030
 Osu pressure is here 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.270
 And Do not there is silicon in low position 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.210
 Also, when I'm low overall 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.320
 Also the mg mark is 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.320
 From here in our hospital 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.430
 If you ask 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.050
 I can't, I'm a frontal critical 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.680
 It is the end 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.680
 Like this 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.450
 Attack from behind is also in the shape of this foot 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:43.349
 I'm sorry 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.349
 I wonder if only 4 schools are qualified and relatively open 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:03:00.410
 It is also one of the attractiveness of Osu press this offensive attack power 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.680
 The curse is low or the center of gravity is high 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.060
 There was something above 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.220
 Bakugan is like 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.110
 Or even critical system 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.110
 I will go to the hospital 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.420
 Mao lyso is not kicked 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:38.800
 If the power level is 710 why the average Bakugan 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.590
 I usually win in par battle 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.590
 It's further pretty tatami easy 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.630
 The feeling I immediately collapsible do such 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:57.000
 By Well do not tell I still do not you strong mark walk 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.900
 I don't know but I think it's probably strong 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.900
 It is recommended 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.550
 So it was an introduction to the press 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.550
 It is recommended
