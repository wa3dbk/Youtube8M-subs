bike gets tough these things will really

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.019 
bike gets tough these things will really
up<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.210> chances<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> catching<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.050> few<00:00:19.230> fish

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
so you all you do is just stick them on

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.470 
so you all you do is just stick them on
your<00:00:22.380> jig<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> time<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.820> fine<00:00:26.480> go

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
your jig just one at a time is fine go

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.200 
your jig just one at a time is fine go
ahead<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.050> cast<00:00:29.039> them<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.880> find

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
ahead and cast them out and what I find

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.740 
ahead and cast them out and what I find
that<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.710> is<00:00:32.270> they<00:00:33.270> don't<00:00:33.390> really

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that they do is they don't really

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.430 
that they do is they don't really
increase<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.140> chances<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.969> getting<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.149> bite

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
but what the fish do is the the crappie

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
but what the fish do is the the crappie
they'll<00:00:40.710> hold<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> lure<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.809> know

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
they'll hold on to the lure for you know

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.020 
they'll hold on to the lure for you know
a<00:00:42.960> split<00:00:43.350> second<00:00:43.739> longer<00:00:43.910> because<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
a split second longer because it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.580 
a split second longer because it
actually<00:00:45.360> has<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:45.539> flavor<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
actually has some flavor and it kind of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.180 
actually has some flavor and it kind of
smells<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> tastes<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.489> fish<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:49.190> they'll

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
smells and tastes like fish so they'll

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.470

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
because crop you're notorious especially

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.750 
because crop you're notorious especially
in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> winter<00:00:54.449> months<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.460> barely<00:00:56.460> grabbing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
in the winter months for barely grabbing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.189 
in the winter months for barely grabbing
ahold<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> jig<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.600> spit<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.140> back

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
ahold of a jig and spit it right back

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
ahold of a jig and spit it right back
out<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.309> only<00:00:59.460> indication<00:01:00.090> you'll<00:01:00.239> have

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
out and the only indication you'll have

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.660 
out and the only indication you'll have
is<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:00.989> using<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.320> float<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.859> might<00:01:02.100> take

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
is if you're using a float it might take

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
is if you're using a float it might take
a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> other<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.559> may

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
a little bit one way or the other or may

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.530 
a little bit one way or the other or may
even<00:01:04.979> sink<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> tiny<00:01:06.210> tiny<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:06.830> but

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
even sink just a tiny tiny bit but

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.179 
even sink just a tiny tiny bit but
really<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> mean<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> they<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.320> bite<00:01:10.500> really

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
really I mean that they they bite really

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
really I mean that they they bite really
really<00:01:11.520> light<00:01:11.700> during<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.000> winter<00:01:12.270> time<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
really light during the winter time so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.270 
really light during the winter time so
these<00:01:13.229> crappie<00:01:13.530> nibbles<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:13.979> give<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hold on to the lure for just a second

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
hold on to the lure for just a second
longer<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.570> mean<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.740> swallow<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
lure on with the crappie nibble on it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
lure on with the crappie nibble on it
before<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:25.350> definitely<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.600> but

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
