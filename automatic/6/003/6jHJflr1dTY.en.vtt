00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.550
 let's learn how to knit motif today 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.939
 such irregular forms 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.919
 it consists of two parts 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.400
 half circle and 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:33.260
 from the rectangle and now i will show how 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.750
 he knits knit begin with the fact that 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.949
 we knit a chain of air loops 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:50.239
 the length of this chain is equal to the width of our 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:55.479
 rectangle like this then knit one 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:59.299
 air loop and passing one loop in 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:03.619
 chain knit the next loop 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:06.220
 nakida column and so knit to the end 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.220
 row 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.770
 here and now knit one air 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.960
 loop 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.450
 turn over and start knitting in 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.079
 the other side and knit until the end 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.079
 row 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:57.620
 knit the very last loop 6 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.620
 columns without nakida this is the second 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.009
 3 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
 four 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.860
 5 and 6 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.540
 so we set the center of the circle 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.180
 continue to knit one by one 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.170
 single crochet into each loop and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
 dopevyazyvayem to the end 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:50.060
 at the end we knit 1 air loop 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.230
 turn over knitting and start knitting 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.230
 reversed 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.450
 so here I am 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.450
 from to end 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:23.010
 then knit two columns without nakida in 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.010
 each loop of the semicircle 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.920
 and then one table 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.920
 seconds to end of row 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.780
 knitting until the end of the series knit one 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.570
 air loop and roll over again 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:17.150
 and continue to knitting one by one 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.150
 column in each loop by the base 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.270
 now make out a semicircle for this in 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.770
 each subsequent row we do 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:40.320
 adding one loop at the top 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:41.500
 semicircles and two more points that I 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.190
 showed 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.310
 these additions we can not do very 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:55.510
 symmetrical then they will be wrong 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:59.949
 noticeable and in conclusion we tie our 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.860
 vertical rows on the edge of his mother 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.760
 one single crochet in each 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.760
 vertical row 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.420
 knit such motives can be different 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.930
 size 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.230
 and they find use in toys 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.340
 for example, this motif is very similar 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:36.290
 dog language can also be tied 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:40.490
 ear for a bunny or whatever 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.120
 animals and maybe you find this 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.960
 the motive 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.200
 and other use to you of evil irina
