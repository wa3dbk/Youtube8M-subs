00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.589
 and today openwork spit all sorts 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.059
 varied 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.480
 let's start with one way how it is done 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 again we take a strand that we divide by 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.270
 three parts 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.539
 it all starts with our regular pigtails and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.390
 we begin to weave so ordinary pigtail on 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.689
 My opinion is certainly not much better 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 drag in a little bit about 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.880
 weaving and start pulling out the beds 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.000
 like this 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.559
 cashier do not have to hold hands 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 relaxed 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:49.620
 so here so here quietly beautiful 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 so pulling out of course it is necessary that all 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:00.559
 our openwork sides were 1 well here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.559
 here is a captivity and that is here it is about 3 not 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 so we hit a pigtail here we have it 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.240
 so beautiful you can do 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.110
 more to make the hair sheath as possible 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.090
 slightly less 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 that is, how much hair allows 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.240
 how much do we need to do here at all 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 what can be done with such a pigtail 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.689
 just get it you can braid on 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.460
 make here such a circle and here such 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.460
 here daisy daisy we will succeed 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.409
 it can also be used for 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 decorating some items yes if we 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:53.939
 made a letter let around her so 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.020
 here is an openwork braid she will be very 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.359
 nice look that is such 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 the thing can be corrected 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:06.409
 everything can be corrected again not afraid 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.590
 hair so what next braid 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.910
 double sided 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.860
 we also take strands of hair 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:22.549
 which we need to divide everything into three parts 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 same thing yes of course i weave the usual 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:33.840
 Spit again much much not weave with 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:40.220
 one side you let 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:45.390
 on the other hand here what is the nuance 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:50.489
 you can you can do everything here and so Hair 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.629
 strand disassemble all right so here it is 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:59.340
 there will be a bigger cashier 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:01.769
 But there is another option that the hair 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 pulling for example we are only here with these 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.459
 here's the edges so here's a little bit leaving 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.880
 with this pigtail right here we are now 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.299
 let's see the different effects i have i 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.079
 take 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:21.390
 from the edges with the main pigtail I 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:26.180
 leave and you get here 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.180
 so she is an airy spider web 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:40.870
 so to speak can be labeled more 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:45.040
 as I said this does not depend on some 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:52.870
 nuances well, that is, in addition to those that we 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:56.490
 chased to see hairstyles on if if 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.490
 we are on the crab 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.410
 if somewhere shaggy as a matter of fact to someone 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.050
 what's scary here what effect are we here 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.300
 see if here we took 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.180
 completely disassemble the strands 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.700
 we got such a big braid 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.410
 very voluminous, as it were, but here we have 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.840
 it turns out got points at the same time 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.390
 passes with us just about a pigtail too 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.390
 very, very beautiful 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.390
 the following 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.810
 notch, too, again on the background live 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.890
 all this, too, just take a strand 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.890
 hair and divide into three parts 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:49.139
 into three parts and we can begin to weave 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:52.620
 tell zigzag braid what are we doing here 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:59.460
 we begin to pull out the hair with 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:06.180
 one side the next strand of hair 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.929
 here we are going to pull out the way 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.849
 more and 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:14.089
 in fact if here and so see if 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.849
 not to get confused you can understand that here 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.469
 in that's it spit 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.869
 here comes one strand only that very thing 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.849
 which as one must pull out 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:25.339
 that is, here we select it alone 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.740
 went through the bottom again the same macro 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:33.849
 pull out that is here it passes and 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:38.479
 again we dismiss her like this 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.479
 again weave again this braid 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:52.509
 which takes place with us 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:52.509
 we yoji from dismiss again and
