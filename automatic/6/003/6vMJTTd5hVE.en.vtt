00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.820
 1 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.670
 did you know for a few years 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.410
 many of the aerial mages are only 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050
 more filmed by helicopters but 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 from drones civil drones to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 four six or eight ellis that allow 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.650
 unpublished shots since 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 sky the company drones pictures which 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.050
 just created in paca we got 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.600
 presented its different models 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.120
 the arrival of the drone was all natural 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 for me 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.399
 the tool as a tool of creation 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 seduced I immediately saw his 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 possibilities for particular cinema the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.670
 advertising and corporate movies or 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.469
 tourism but also photography 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.379
 our drones are not only made for 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.079
 adapt to the legislation but also to 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.059
 the simple request of customers who 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.850
 is not at all the same as are in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.310
 photo in technical surveys or in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 classical audiovisual production that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.909
 she herself is very varied after one year 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 research and development one is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.820
 finally ready for the high end thanks 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.130
 in particular to lucknow that operates the diploma 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.649
 required today for a pilot 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.659
 can take the joysticks it's a 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.070
 theoretic ulm patent or private pilot 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.780
 there are many other constraints 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.719
 but the limit of the drone to the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.189
 first legislative and then material 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.320
 that is, the drone can not 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.880
 fly that ten fifteen minutes and can only 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.880
 fly only by weak wind 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.510
 but what are the applications 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.880
 possible drugs we ourselves 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.970
 focus instead on creation 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.430
 being myself a photographer 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.170
 director I favor production 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.880
 audiovisual creation the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.530
 photography now we can everything to 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.000
 be called for the enhancement 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.320
 an archaeological cultural heritage 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.010
 architectural tourist and who has 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.380
 need for aerial photography 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.500
 everything is not feasible by the drone and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.380
 that's why we're still proposing 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.730
 the helicopter on the plane is the host and 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.920
 of the EU hellemmes and finally the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.710
 development of drones pictures that's 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.860
 also the image bank we go 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.810
 develop a photo library 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
