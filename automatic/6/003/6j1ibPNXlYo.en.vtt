looking at the back look at this I mean
you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.480> clearly<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> yellowing

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you can clearly see that the yellowing

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.180 
you can clearly see that the yellowing
has<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:51.050> faded<00:00:52.050> down<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.649> mean<00:00:52.980> that's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
has actually faded down I mean that's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
has actually faded down I mean that's
almost<00:00:53.520> invisible<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
almost invisible you can see see a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.279 
almost invisible you can see see a
little<00:00:55.350> few<00:00:55.590> spots<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:57.140> obviously<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
little few spots there obviously the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
little few spots there obviously the
downside<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.370> sticker

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
downside to this is this sticker

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.330 
downside to this is this sticker
obviously<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.480> peeled<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.100> soaking

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
obviously got peeled off in the soaking

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.369 
obviously got peeled off in the soaking
process<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.269> really<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.989> bothered<00:01:04.140> about

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
process but really not bothered about

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.660 
process but really not bothered about
that<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.360> yellowing<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.260> back<00:01:07.470> um<00:01:07.740> I'm

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that the yellowing on the back um I'm

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.620 
that the yellowing on the back um I'm
really<00:01:09.210> glad<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.660> report<00:01:09.800> as<00:01:11.360> reduced<00:01:12.360> down<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
really glad to report as reduced down to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.290 
really glad to report as reduced down to
a<00:01:13.110> bare<00:01:13.380> minimum<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:14.400> I'm<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.880> happy<00:01:15.120> with

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
a bare minimum so I'm really happy with

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.870 
a bare minimum so I'm really happy with
that<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.890> along<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> top<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that and along the top as well to a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
that and along the top as well to a
degree<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.270> mean<00:01:19.130> especially<00:01:20.130> kind<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> with

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
degree I mean especially kind of with

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.210 
degree I mean especially kind of with
the<00:01:20.640> backside<00:01:21.300> at<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:21.570> top<00:01:21.810> half<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.260> this<00:01:22.410> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the backside at the top half of this you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.040 
the backside at the top half of this you
can<00:01:23.370> see<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.330> faded<00:01:24.630> down

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
can see it's kind of really faded down

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.800 
can see it's kind of really faded down
and<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:26.610> quite<00:01:26.850> visible<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.480> look<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.720> my

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and it's quite visible if you look at my

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.770 
and it's quite visible if you look at my
last<00:01:27.960> video<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> compare<00:01:28.800> this<00:01:28.980> cartridge<00:01:29.780> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
last video and compare this cartridge to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
last video and compare this cartridge to
what<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> looks<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> real

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
what it looks like now it's it's a real

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.520 
what it looks like now it's it's a real
big<00:01:32.700> difference<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.810> again<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.410> just

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
big difference and again this is just

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.090 
big difference and again this is just
one<00:01:34.830> night<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:36.000> overnight<00:01:36.360> soaking<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.890> hot

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
one night one overnight soaking one hot

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010 
one night one overnight soaking one hot
water<00:01:38.340> session<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.480> know<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.720> sure<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
water session and you know I'm sure a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
water session and you know I'm sure a
few<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.680> sessions<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:43.650> doing<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.130> process

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
few more sessions of doing this process

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160 
few more sessions of doing this process
would<00:01:44.730> that<00:01:44.880> probably<00:01:45.330> actually<00:01:45.690> completely

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
would that probably actually completely

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.920 
would that probably actually completely
remove<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.300> major<00:01:48.660> difference

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
remove it and that is a major difference

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
remove it and that is a major difference
there<00:01:49.410> completely<00:01:50.220> yeah<00:01:50.940> just<00:01:51.120> go<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
there completely yeah just go back and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.700 
there completely yeah just go back and
check<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.840> last<00:01:52.020> video<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.530> you'll<00:01:52.620> probably

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
check my last video and you'll probably

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130 
check my last video and you'll probably
see<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.730> can<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.180> comparison<00:01:54.630> but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
see you can do a little comparison but

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.570 
see you can do a little comparison but
yeah<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.220> cool

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
yeah that's pretty cool

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.760 
yeah that's pretty cool
