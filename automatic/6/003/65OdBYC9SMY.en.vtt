that<00:01:41.430> helps<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.360> absorption<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.049> really

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that helps with absorption but really

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.460 
that helps with absorption but really
isn't<00:01:43.710> necessary<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.079> micronized

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
isn't necessary it is micronized

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.499 
isn't necessary it is micronized
creatine<00:01:46.950> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.850> pure<00:01:48.270> creatine

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
which is great but another example how

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.950 
which is great but another example how
they'll<00:01:50.790> add<00:01:50.970> companies<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.509> add<00:01:51.630> extra

you're cutting exactly and I take
creatine<00:02:53.019> year-round<00:02:54.069> specifically<00:02:55.069> because

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
creatine year-round specifically because

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.819 
creatine year-round specifically because
it's<00:02:55.459> essential<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.630> recovery<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.680> your

it's essential for the recovery of your
muscles<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.819> like<00:02:58.970> anything<00:02:59.239> else<00:02:59.360> wait<00:03:00.140> is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
muscles just like anything else wait is

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.720 
muscles just like anything else wait is
that<00:03:00.319> companies<00:03:00.620> will<00:03:00.860> rip<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.160> off<00:03:01.190> as<00:03:01.549> far

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that companies will rip you off as far

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.309 
that companies will rip you off as far
as<00:03:01.849> taking<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.599> they'll<00:03:02.840> tell<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.200> do<00:03:03.290> a

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
as taking it is they'll tell you to do a

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.979 
as taking it is they'll tell you to do a
loading<00:03:03.769> phase<00:03:03.980> yeah<00:03:04.430> that's<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.420> 10<00:03:05.720> 20

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
loading phase yeah that's like 10 20

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.539 
loading phase yeah that's like 10 20
grams<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.470> day<00:03:06.500> or<00:03:06.799> whatever<00:03:06.920> fight<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.400> first

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
grams a day or whatever fight the first

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.180 
grams a day or whatever fight the first
month<00:03:07.880> more<00:03:08.239> scoops<00:03:08.569> that's<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.650> use<00:03:09.920> more

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
month more scoops that's so you use more

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.710 
month more scoops that's so you use more
of<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> fastener<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.910> come<00:03:11.090> back<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.450> read<00:03:11.630> up

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
of a fastener to come back and read up

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.390 
of a fastener to come back and read up
and<00:03:11.870> get<00:03:11.959> more<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.380> which<00:03:13.069> is<00:03:13.190> absolutely

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
and get more of it which is absolutely

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.220 
and get more of it which is absolutely
pointless<00:03:13.790> do<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.780> don't<00:03:14.930> even<00:03:15.079> do<00:03:15.200> a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
pointless do it you don't even do a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.020 
pointless do it you don't even do a
loading<00:03:15.530> phase<00:03:15.709> I've<00:03:16.340> done<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.670> full<00:03:16.910> video

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
loading phase I've done a full video

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.400 
loading phase I've done a full video
increasing<00:03:17.480> before<00:03:17.750> us<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.989> he's<00:03:18.109> basically

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
increasing before us that he's basically

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.580 
increasing before us that he's basically
shown<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:19.010> after<00:03:19.310> like<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.639> 60-day<00:03:20.209> use<00:03:20.590> with

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
shown that after like a 60-day use with

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.830 
shown that after like a 60-day use with
people<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.100> were<00:03:22.220> loading<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.910> 68<00:03:23.569> years<00:03:23.750> of

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
people that were loading and 68 years of

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.960 
people that were loading and 68 years of
people<00:03:24.019> who<00:03:24.079> did<00:03:24.200> not<00:03:24.230> lowered<00:03:24.799> there<00:03:25.220> was<00:03:25.430> no

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
people who did not lowered there was no

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.680 
people who did not lowered there was no
more<00:03:26.600> or<00:03:27.079> less<00:03:27.730> creatine<00:03:28.730> phosphate<00:03:29.120> levels

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
more or less creatine phosphate levels

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.670 
more or less creatine phosphate levels
in<00:03:30.040> either<00:03:31.209> person<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:33.019> improving<00:03:33.410> that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
in either person so it's improving that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.050 
in either person so it's improving that
the<00:03:33.739> floating<00:03:34.069> face<00:03:34.220> doesn't<00:03:34.639> work<00:03:34.790> but

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the floating face doesn't work but

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.610 
the floating face doesn't work but

Compton's will give it to you to buy
more<00:03:36.859> exactly<00:03:37.730> that'll<00:03:37.970> tell<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.269> absorption

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
more exactly that'll tell you absorption

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.930 
more exactly that'll tell you absorption
rates<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.380> don't<00:03:40.010> give<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.190> they'll<00:03:40.670> give<00:03:40.850> you

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
rates to don't give you they'll give you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.789 
rates to don't give you they'll give you
the<00:03:40.970> whole<00:03:41.660> spiel<00:03:41.900> about<00:03:41.930> absorption<00:03:42.620> rates

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
the whole spiel about absorption rates

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.860 
the whole spiel about absorption rates
and<00:03:42.980> how<00:03:43.069> oh<00:03:43.280> my<00:03:43.459> gosh<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.000> hydrochloride

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
and how oh my gosh this is hydrochloride

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.780 
and how oh my gosh this is hydrochloride
so<00:03:45.139> it<00:03:45.260> absorbs<00:03:45.380> quicker<00:03:45.950> into<00:03:46.250> your<00:03:46.370> muscles

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
so it absorbs quicker into your muscles

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.330 
so it absorbs quicker into your muscles
with<00:03:47.389> no<00:03:47.600> literally<00:03:47.959> yep<00:03:48.470> no<00:03:48.859> water<00:03:49.100> weight

loss<00:03:49.730> up<00:03:49.880> creating<00:03:50.269> works<00:03:50.480> exactly<00:03:51.079> that's

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
loss up creating works exactly that's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.410 
loss up creating works exactly that's
the<00:03:51.739> whole<00:03:51.950> reason<00:03:51.980> why<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.609> would<00:03:53.090> ever<00:03:53.120> take

treating how and how it operates can

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.069 
treating how and how it operates can
