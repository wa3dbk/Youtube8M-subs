00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.000
 None of us know the next conversation 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Between parent and child on the way back from kindergarten 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.960
 The parent asks the child 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.620
 How did you have a garden today? 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.500
 OK 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.504
 Or if we are lucky 

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:20.004
 fun 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.589
 What did you do today? 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:22.089
 is nothing 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.600
 We often ask ourselves how to develop a conversation 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.300
 Real with a young child 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 Reading books together can be an opportunity 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 For real conversations between parents and children 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.294
 There are several ways to develop a real conversation 

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:42.300
 With a young boy around a book 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.460
 But first of all, one must always pay attention to the child's mood 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 Parents know their children, 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.460
 They know when it's right for them to talk and when not 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.974
 We do not have to force our will to talk to the child 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 On him at a time that did not suit him 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.980
 There are also enough books to read the book together 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.600
 No need to plow, 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 You do not have to ask too many questions 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.200
 And you can enjoy together and the book is the conversation 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
 Another thing that is very important to us to remember 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 Is that conversation is not a test of reading comprehension 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.460
 We do not need to check the child, 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.920
 We do not examine him if he understood the material correctly 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.480
 We want to talk to him 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.800
 And that means co-operation on our part to real questions 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.400
 As parents to pay attention to developmental changes in our children 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.560
 When we read a book with a toddler at the age of two plus or minus 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.640
 It is right for us to ask them what color the ball is 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 Ask to be pointed at the sun 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.740
 To find some object that might be hiding in the column 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.020
 But this is not a conversation for three, four or five 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.400
 A real conversation with a preschooler includes first of all 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.000
 A question we do not know the answer to, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.800
 An authentic authentic question says I wonder too 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.960
 I want to know, too 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.700
 I really care as a parent to know what you think? 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820
 Was the child sad at the end? 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.600
 Not because I know, because I want to know what you might know 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.300
 A real conversation with a preschooler 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.060
 It's also an opportunity for me as a mother 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.780
 To convey to you things I think, not just asking 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.980
 I can take the opportunity to tell you about something that happened to me when I was little 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 That's how we start a real conversation that might follow 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.640
 I will accept the child's participation in something that is more than 'okay', 'fun' and 'nothing' 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.720
 I invite the parents to review the parents' suggestions 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.120
 At the end of the books of the Library of Pajamas 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.600
 There are many examples of open-ended questions and conversation with young children
