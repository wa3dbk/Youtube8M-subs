00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.559
 in the second I propose a big diagram 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.079
 solar light theme band 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.429
 entry of mineral materials and 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.070
 of energy in the biosphere 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.410
 on this diagram I chose different 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.320
 scales of observation i'm going to start 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.179
 by the macroscopic scale visible at 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.330
 the naked eye here I represent you a 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.029
 green plant then I will talk 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.879
 at the cellular level you recognize 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.800
 chlorophyllian cells of the plant and 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.980
 finally I will approach at the scale of 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.690
 the body here I symbolize a 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.510
 chloroplasts presents that one can 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.430
 observe in light microscopy then the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.399
 solar light everything starts with the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.449
 sun and light energy or energy 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:55.390
 solar I represented in surrounded this 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.579
 energy that I called h nu it's in 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.070
 does the energy of a photon so 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.299
 solar energy will allow to do 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.720
 return mineral carbon co2 as well as 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.689
 of the water that I have surrounded here h2o and 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.909
 ions of mineral salts so the input of 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.500
 co2 of mineral carbon is made 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 basically in parts 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.860
 aerial chlorophyllian 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.479
 basically at the leaf level 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 of the plant so part 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.060
 chlorophyllian that I represented in 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.280
 glass your plant it also requires 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.920
 a supply of water the water will enter 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.299
 basically spoken the part 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.560
 underground root then there is also 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.280
 a water absorption but 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 more anecdotal at the level of leaves 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.220
 mutual assistance to co2 inputs and input 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.560
 of solar energy all this at the level of 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 your biosphere will allow you to do 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.750
 enter mineral carbon and water and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.759
 via solar energy to transform it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 in organic matter 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.149
 for that I represented you here I 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.670
 zoomed to the party level 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.039
 chlorophyllian open cells 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.590
 if you go to China chlorophyllian and 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.319
 on a plant cell you saw it in 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.230
 the theme a plant cell she has 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.660
 specificities from a point of view 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.470
 structural is there a going that she that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.840
 I represented here she has some 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.209
 green chloroplasts why 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.950
 the glass is mostly due to a pigment the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.319
 chlorophyll there are several types of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.920
 chlorophyll and it gives a color 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.470
 green 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.170
 ateke their place then to your cell and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.780
 more globally macroscopically do we have 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.970
 plants and then the other specifies 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.630
 the other specificity of plants 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.790
 higher 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.489
 it's the parish here is rather 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.049
 cellulosic at the pectin parties and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.650
 of cellulose my light will come to type 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.810
 chloroplasts and via co2 and water 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.120
 then the CO2 brought by the atmosphere 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.540
 or at the level of the aerial parts and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.700
 the water mostly brought by the soil to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.130
 root level of my energy gone 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.650
 bright to chenu will allow me to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.299
 transform these waters of h2o into matter 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.989
 organic this is called the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.940
 photo synthesis game tv here 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.010
 photosynthesis photo is the energy that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.750
 allows this material synthesis 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.269
 organic and synthes I pointed out in 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.290
 brown because in balance equation 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.430
 photosynthesis 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.940
 so I have carbon dioxide co2 from 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.350
 h2o water that react via energy 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.250
 solar to give glucose matters 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.680
 organic and also released from 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.600
 oxygen for information this 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.019
 balance equation it takes the right and that's 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.280
 for that I wrote six co2 +6 h2o 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.630
 give c 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.870
 if internship we too would be the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.569
 Glucose molecule is located at 2 more 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.580
 cause is going to be stored in form 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.620
 starch that you may have put in 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.260
 evidence for example with goal wolf 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.500
 or at yaudet the starch will take one that 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.069
 will take in the presence of these dyes 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.080
 an almost blue coloring ink 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.030
 so my friend don`t be biomass skin 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.760
 and it's called productivity 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.160
 primary photosynthesis allows you the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.769
 synthesis of organic matter so in 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.959
 balance the sunlight input from 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.560
 minerals and energy in the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.780
 biosphere 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.870
 so we have as input materials 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.030
 minerals mineral water and 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.280
 carbon dioxide 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.590
 solar energy will allow me to 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.729
 bring in this material and the 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.330
 transform into organic matter example 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.700
 starch that will be consumed on site and 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.010
 also exported to non- organs 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.800
 chlorophyllian for example the root tone 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.380
 plants once they die it goes 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.030
 break down and will feed the soil in 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.960
 organic matter you can see in 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.240
 another video 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.770
 the composition of the soil that is both 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.770
 organic and both mineral
