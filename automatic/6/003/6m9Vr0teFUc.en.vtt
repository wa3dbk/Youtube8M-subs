00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 Good people, let's demonstrate in this 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.580
 calculation how to size the air flow 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.370
 for fans and exhaust fans of a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:20.789
 boiler with the bagasse 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:24.060
 gray fields will be the digital fields 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 the other other fields green fields and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.830
 blades are automatic gearboxes one of which 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 we are not giving a return of values 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:42.570
 we have to have a brother first 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:57.090
 values with respect to the boiler that are 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 they operate the steam temperature 350 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.750
 degrees water temperature feed 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:22.159
 50% of residue gas temperature of 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:28.049
 boiler 80 ° number of water walls 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:31.530
 the use of carbon dioxide is a 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.250
 percentage that we will 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.740
 we expect on the issue in the chimney 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.619
 let's consider our case 14 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:49.409
 on average these values ​​range from 14 to 15 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.670
 percent for large boilers 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.770
 postage 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.509
 boiler up to 22 25 tonnes 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.369
 actually uses them around 1 10% 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.369
 with regard to the production of steam 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.180
 tons of steam per hour was missing 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.880
 ambient air temperature value 30 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.980
 degrees or percent of bagasse 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.680
 generally vary from one to 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.450
 two percent if they do not have this 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:35.220
 value in hand we will consider that our 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:38.070
 1 75% completed album information 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.240
 are still missing some altitude from the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.670
 facility consider the law 150 meters 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.460
 at sea level gas temperature 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.940
 who enter the author then our case 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:03:00.600
 How will you have a washer before the author? 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.340
 considered to be 120 ° filling all 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.380
 The informations 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.300
 we have to click the button calculate the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.300
 percentage of oxygen 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.430
 this is done the calculations and there already 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.350
 we can read the information just below 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.209
 for knowledge effect after 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.890
 filled in all the 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.830
 information 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.560
 we have already the specific dance age of 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:35.459
 gases would be 1.21 85 kilo normal per 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.870
 cubic meter and the specific gravity of 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:44.489
 which is 1,293 normal pounds per 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.380
 cubic meter automatically after the 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.170
 filling in the information 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.459
 we also have here the density of air 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:58.560
 corrected for 30 degrees with the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.350
 attitude of those 650 meters and also the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.430
 corrected gas density as a function of 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:10.400
 temperature of 120 degrees with 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.400
 650 meters from the sea 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.910
 a very interesting aspect that, in addition to 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.670
 of airflows 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.690
 we can see here we also have 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:40.550
 quite interesting information like 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:05:14.660
 consumption of bagasse consumption values 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:05:14.660
 higher and lower than the given value 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:22.130
 upper and lower 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.890
 our results which are the reasons 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.520
 air 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:39.050
 We can see that we already have the values 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.050
 volumetric ratio invasion 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.060
 forty-eight thousand five hundred and ninety 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.789
 and two per hour and already converted into 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:59.820
 function of the 30 degree temperature and 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:01.580
 altitude of 650 137 thousand 225 thousand meters 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.789
 cubic per hour 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:11.820
 hence the reason for the pain or firewall 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:16.410
 secondary ventilator pain but the máskara 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.390
 volumetric ratio and also the 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.840
 for the author 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:26.130
 by criterion of the program it is always 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.820
 calculating the flow but here selection and 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:35.100
 playing a slack of over 15% boilers 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:38.490
 smaller this slack is to withdraw the case thinks 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.730
 to reduce this gap is 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.270
 criterion based on the flow of 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.660
 selection that is written below here 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.000
 in this jungle in blue 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:55.320
 we also have here in the right column 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.610
 but the sum of the total mass of primary air 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:04.560
 secondary and this part pain only 1 196 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:09.300
 thousand and 884 pounds for the time being, 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:14.430
 total mass of gasoline below is a 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:19.280
 of the result of the difference in 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.280
 exhaustion - the air is inflated 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:35.210
 this is a small demonstration of what 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.900
 we can do with this car is a 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:44.080
 calculation of great value for those who 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.420
 work in the field and understand the subject 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:52.330
 as it is also a very 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:56.420
 interesting for those who want to learn and 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:59.020
 understand a little of how they are performed 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.020
 these calculations 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:09.430
 we stay here and hope they get 

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.430
 because it is an excellent channel
