00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.180 
my inbox by accident things about wiring
and<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.110> things<00:00:13.320> about<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.740> size<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and some things about the size of the

and some things about the size of the
engine<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.910> figure<00:00:15.839> out<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:16.080> kind<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.320> frame

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
engine to figure out what kind of frame

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.929 
engine to figure out what kind of frame
they<00:00:16.890> could<00:00:17.100> use<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.410> wiring<00:00:19.949> start<00:00:20.789> with

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
they could use so the wiring start with

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.710 
they could use so the wiring start with
that<00:00:22.460> see<00:00:25.010> got<00:00:26.010> where<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.789> these<00:00:26.910> wires<00:00:27.240> come

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that see got where do these wires come

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.130 
that see got where do these wires come
from<00:00:28.849> okay<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> wires<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
from okay you got the wires from the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.299 
from okay you got the wires from the
throttle<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.149> come<00:00:33.390> down<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.530> mine

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
throttle and they come down and mine

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
throttle and they come down and mine
loop<00:00:35.579> around<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:36.149> weird<00:00:36.390> come<00:00:37.200> down<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> here

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
loop around all weird come down to here

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440 
loop around all weird come down to here
and<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> green<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> yellow<00:00:39.239> one

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and there's a green one and a yellow one

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.770 
and there's a green one and a yellow one
with<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> red<00:00:40.020> stripe<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> green<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.750> goes<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
with a red stripe the green one goes to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.889 
with a red stripe the green one goes to
ground<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.370> drilled<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.760> hole<00:00:47.899> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
ground which I just drilled a hole in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.209 
ground which I just drilled a hole in
the<00:00:49.050> bottom<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> bike<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:49.980> put<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the bottom of the bike and then put a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.240 
the bottom of the bike and then put a
screw<00:00:50.520> through<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:52.020> yellow<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> red

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
screw through it the yellow and red

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.660 
screw through it the yellow and red
striped<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.000> goes<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> white<00:00:55.309> which<00:00:56.309> comes

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
striped one goes to white which comes

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.779 
striped one goes to white which comes
off<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.539> engine<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
off of the engine and then you have the

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.260 
off of the engine and then you have the
this<00:01:02.789> thing<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:05.270> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this thing which I think it's like you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.190 
this thing which I think it's like you
know<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.810> magneto<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:08.100> coil<00:01:08.430> or

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
know it's the magneto or coil or

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100 
know it's the magneto or coil or
whatever<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.439> called<00:01:11.090> it's<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> blue

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
whatever it's called it's got the blue

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.640 
whatever it's called it's got the blue
and<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.150> blue<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> black

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
and the right of the blue and the black

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.609 
and the right of the blue and the black
the<00:01:16.650> black<00:01:16.890> goes<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.310> black<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:19.380> blue

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the black goes to black and the blue

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.960 
the black goes to black and the blue
goes<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> blue<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
goes to blue and I think that's all the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.620 
goes to blue and I think that's all the
wiring<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:29.659> also<00:01:30.659> had<00:01:31.049> somebody<00:01:31.530> asked<00:01:32.070> about

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
wiring I also had somebody asked about

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.410 
wiring I also had somebody asked about
how<00:01:33.630> big<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> engine<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:35.030> how<00:01:36.030> big<00:01:36.210> they're

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
how big the engine was how big they're

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.830 
how big the engine was how big they're
framed<00:01:38.090> needed<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:41.150> fit<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> engine<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
framed needed to be to fit the engine in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.180 
framed needed to be to fit the engine in
it<00:01:44.570> my<00:01:45.570> frame<00:01:46.909> from<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
it my frame from the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.700 
it my frame from the
let's<00:01:50.190> try<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> other<00:01:50.760> side<00:01:51.440> I'm<00:01:52.440> trying

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
let's try from the other side I'm trying

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.290 
let's try from the other side I'm trying
to<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.830> this<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.150> edit

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
to do this in one take so I have to edit

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.420 
to do this in one take so I have to edit
it<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:55.050> see<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> frame<00:01:55.590> from<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.980> pedal<00:01:56.400> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it to see the frame from the pedal to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.190 
it to see the frame from the pedal to
the<00:01:56.580> top<00:01:56.940> on<00:01:57.240> mine<00:01:57.510> is<00:01:57.870> about<00:01:58.340> 19<00:01:59.340> inches<00:01:59.490> and

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
the top on mine is about 19 inches and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.250 
the top on mine is about 19 inches and
the<00:02:01.200> engine<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:03.600> only<00:02:04.580> about<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:06.150> would<00:02:06.870> say<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
the engine is only about I would say to

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.830 
the engine is only about I would say to
about<00:02:07.560> 15<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.820> top<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> spark<00:02:09.570> plug

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
about 15 at the top of the spark plug

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.770 
about 15 at the top of the spark plug
boot<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.240> about<00:02:12.450> five

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
boot so you have I have about five

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080 
boot so you have I have about five
inches<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.320> space<00:02:13.560> between<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.550> engine<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
inches of space between the engine and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.240 
inches of space between the engine and
the<00:02:15.750> top<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.830> frame<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:19.160> another<00:02:20.160> thing

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the top of the frame there another thing

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.979 
the top of the frame there another thing
that<00:02:20.640> was<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> problem<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.239> me<00:02:21.300> was<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.810> back

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
that was a problem for me was the back

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.530 
that was a problem for me was the back
fork<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.980> first<00:02:23.220> bike<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.700> bought<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.360> back

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
fork the first bike I bought the back

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.770 
fork the first bike I bought the back
fork<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:25.110> too<00:02:25.320> small<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.330> think<00:02:27.410> yeah<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.650> one

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
fork was too small I think yeah this one

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.820 
fork was too small I think yeah this one
as<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:33.260> sort<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.520> it's<00:02:35.520> about<00:02:36.830> right

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
as you can see sort of it's about right

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.729 
as you can see sort of it's about right
now<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> wash<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.080> put<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.650> about

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
now with the wash as I put in it's about

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.010 
now with the wash as I put in it's about
six<00:02:41.100> inches<00:02:41.459> across<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:42.180> think<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.480> started

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
six inches across I think it started

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.650 
six inches across I think it started
only<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.560> five<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:44.850> first<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.209> was<00:02:45.390> only

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
only like five but my first one was only

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.380 
only like five but my first one was only
four<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.410> was<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.560> problem<00:02:46.830> because<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
four and that was a problem because the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.940 
four and that was a problem because the
sprocket<00:02:49.050> was<00:02:49.320> actually<00:02:49.709> touching<00:02:50.220> here<00:02:50.720> so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
sprocket was actually touching here so

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.870 
sprocket was actually touching here so
as<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.489> right<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:54.049> I've<00:02:55.049> got<00:02:55.350> four

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
as you can see right here I've got four

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.720 
as you can see right here I've got four
washers<00:02:56.989> stuffed<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.760> push<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.989> away

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
washers stuffed in there to push it away

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.449 
washers stuffed in there to push it away
so<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.690> chain<00:03:03.930> doesn't<00:03:04.320> rub<00:03:07.190> I'm<00:03:08.190> not

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
so that the chain doesn't rub I'm not

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.090 
so that the chain doesn't rub I'm not
sure<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.870> any<00:03:10.019> other<00:03:10.140> questions<00:03:10.830> people

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
sure if there any other questions people

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.630 
sure if there any other questions people
had<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.670> didn't<00:03:11.970> answer<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:13.769> if<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.100> want

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
to know something else I can just leave
