00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.830
 yes today I find you for a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.360
 new tutorial in this video i'm going 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.370
 give you all my studies for 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 able to wear a very lipstick 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.710
 dark without looking even cadaverous 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.420
 the first tip is to do well 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 are a dish all in transparency so 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.539
 I do not use a cc cream it's 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.490
 much less common and leaden 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 that a baby cream that keeps a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 cool side and glowy because that's 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.920
 often that's the problem with reds to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 very dark lips we seem to have the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.980
 really dying complexion of a guard and the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 transparency and freshness 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 it's really important with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.530
 your lipstick then have I 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.270
 am going to camouflage messin but of the same 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 way I use a concealer that is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.719
 that's the color of my skin tone I 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 do not make dark circles too clear 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.980
 because a highlighter is too 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
 pronounced x under the eyes it's really going 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.270
 swear with students very dark and it's going 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.340
 really do that too overrated and its 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 pretty for my taste our shipping I 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 fixed and complexion with this powder of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.829
 at so organic which is non- comedogenic is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.550
 really at a low price she is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.550
 really awesome 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.660
 then I will apply mattera koussa 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.370
 so from guerlain jean applies 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.290
 generously and well then I'm going 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.730
 really well dimmed with a brush 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.320
 clean so it's pretty important 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.850
 to use this kind of product with 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.050
 of students very dark because often 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.730
 the lips answer each other 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.460
 to disappear the complexion much more white 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.840
 in fact in comparison and suddenly it's 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.850
 important to bring back a little bit of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.020
 colors to the face so I support it very 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.000
 generously but do not forget 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:44.650
 really much faded it helps to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.510
 keep a natural side then I'm going 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.020
 use the readers either centers of 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.000
 at mac 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.650
 so when I wear the lips very 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.870
 dark I love to make a glowy complexion 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.490
 so advised glory so it's for me 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.590
 very important to put leicester 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.360
 especially on the cheekbones but also 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.390
 around them the other places 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.250
 tanned as not the ridge of the nose a small 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.500
 little chin forehead and that 's okay 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.420
 to really give vent to the face and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.340
 then I move on to the stay stage which 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.330
 is indispensable and even more when 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.330
 we have very marked students 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.460
 we will then go to make-up 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.590
 eyes after the eye shadow so if 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.420
 the adage Thursday that we must not 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.430
 wear makeup eyes with a red 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.440
 very dark lips ben me I do 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.090
 really the opposite ie 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
 I think it's not you when we 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.570
 Mac bought too unbalanced especially 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.800
 with that kind of colors what again 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.990
 it can happen with lipsticks 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.100
 type morange sap is very pretty there I 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.900
 find that it really does too much 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.670
 balanced so I like it 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.520
 applied a little eye shadow 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.070
 beige brown and black make a smoky very 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.320
 light and pull pretty concentrated actually 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.210
 close to the eyelashes that is to say that I 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.350
 not go back too much on the eyelid and you 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.570
 go see what's going to give 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.100
 so little depth to the look and that 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.110
 will allow me to balance the red to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.110
 lips that we will wear later 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:24.500
 this price 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.960
 I will then put a little bit of 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.360
 eyeshadow evening massis corner 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.980
 external in peace it's using a 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.420
 brush from these two analyzes that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.400
 is sharp is really handy 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.510
 for that I have a promo code in bar 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.250
 info if you're interested 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.590
 my goal here is really shots and 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.590
 the material outwards to the maximum 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.180
 then I will apply a little bit 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.380
 of light in this makeup with this 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.630
 lighthouse father-in-law at michael forever 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.940
 which is actually a real kind of 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.170
 duke of the sidecar of a naked gift 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.760
 looks much more gray on the screen 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.650
 exactly why but it's really 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.600
 a super bright lighthouse to bring 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.340
 a little light style and then I 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.410
 go to the elector under the eyebrow 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.820
 before applying me sticky mukasa 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.330
 earth to give a small side 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.330
 Oriental 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:35.020
 wenger that advocates organic growth 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.520
 is absolutely indispensable as 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.900
 always in makeup eyes 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.150
 movie and then as I wanted already 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.620
 six passes in internal micro gives it 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.300
 really a little oriental side I 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.460
 found in makeup when at 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.020
 makeup there like that 11 and with 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.490
 dark lips otherwise it's for me a 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.979
 combo much more interesting than 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.620
 when applying fair war basin 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:05:05.050
 eyelid thirst liner upper and well 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:06.280
 sure i go to mascara stage nos 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.560
 customers be the eyes something of 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 very this word that very smoked and that remains 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.039
 quite natural and then we go to 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.289
 lipstick so that's for sure I help him 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.810
 from mac that I'm going to apply on the 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.550
 heart of the lips really without going 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.320
 too much outward since then I 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.240
 I will use this pencil from Clinic 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.590
 which exactly the same color as the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.180
 lipstick some flame 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.610
 besides that it allows me to 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.349
 draw the outline really so 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.909
 quarter without having to use by 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.919
 example council hours all around this 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.810
 which for me is really felt natural 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.370
 to the possible so really affect your 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.680
 hand-held lipstick and draw around 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.060
 lips after for eventually 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.919
 come back with the lipstick by the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.449
 following comes console is given it's 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.530
 not at all forbidden but hot that the 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.530
 result is much more beautiful 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.480
 it's better 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.200
 girls this little tutorial a little 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.340
 little different from the others is finally 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.720
 finished I hope you will have 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.710
 loved the concept in any case me 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.120

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.220
