redist let's try and then sm this ms i
don't<00:04:05.110> think<00:04:05.319> it's<00:04:05.410> going<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> run<00:04:05.890> now<00:04:06.750> just

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
don't think it's going to run now just

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.840 
don't think it's going to run now just
try<00:04:07.989> looking<00:04:08.319> all<00:04:08.560> these<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.340> installing

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.700 

so<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.560> will<00:04:16.680> even<00:04:16.830> load<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:18.530> sometimes<00:04:19.530> they

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
so it will even load it sometimes they

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.580 
so it will even load it sometimes they
don't<00:04:19.830> even<00:04:19.950> load<00:04:20.280> up<00:04:21.260> sometimes<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.380> have<00:04:22.440> to

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
XP and hit apply and then ok and maybe

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.330 
XP and hit apply and then ok and maybe
it'll<00:05:01.800> work<00:05:01.830> now

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.960 

or<00:05:04.970> maybe<00:05:05.180> not<00:05:06.010> see<00:05:07.010> this<00:05:07.130> is<00:05:07.310> all<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.610> trial

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
or maybe not see this is all this trial

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.850 
or maybe not see this is all this trial
and<00:05:08.120> error<00:05:08.240> stuff<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.900> completely<00:05:09.290> new<00:05:09.590> this

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
and error stuff and completely new this

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.439 
and error stuff and completely new this
linux<00:05:10.870> stuff<00:05:12.130> so<00:05:14.830> maybe<00:05:15.830> sadeghi<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:17.120> don't

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
linux stuff so maybe sadeghi I don't

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.790 
linux stuff so maybe sadeghi I don't
know<00:05:17.540> if<00:05:17.630> I'm<00:05:17.750> pronouncing<00:05:17.900> that<00:05:18.260> right<00:05:18.560> but

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
know if I'm pronouncing that right but

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.010 
know if I'm pronouncing that right but
maybe<00:05:18.949> that<00:05:19.190> will<00:05:19.340> work<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.910> little<00:05:20.690> bit<00:05:21.020> better

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
maybe that will work a little bit better

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.960 
maybe that will work a little bit better
so<00:05:24.460> this<00:05:25.460> is<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:26.030> Threepio<00:05:26.419> from<00:05:26.810> WM<00:05:27.169> clan<00:05:27.350> net

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
so this is the Threepio from WM clan net

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.389
