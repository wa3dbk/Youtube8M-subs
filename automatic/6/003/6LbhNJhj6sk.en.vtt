00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.779
 Good day to all with you 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.599
 I am always Ivan Martynov 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.700
 Today I want to tell you about very 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.930
 useful free application 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.160
 review with which you can find 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.099
 discount application which is 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.619
 free or cheaper it is very 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.480
 convenient and this video is natural for those 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.000
 who about the application don't you know 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.360
 maybe forgot but when did you see him 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.090
 I met him those who know not 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.370
 look because sometimes under the video 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.659
 write by i already know if you know not 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.480
 look and so i think the most important thing 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.670
 the section here is a free application 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.589
 which I just discovered where there is 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.659
 several search criteria for example 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.550
 more than 100 likes are now enabled 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.499
 there is so that he on the list only gave 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.070
 rated after all app because 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.479
 that free can be something that can 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.040
 only be free that is 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.020
 totally simple wacky here 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.720
 Still, the application quality with 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.690
 big discounts like what used to be 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.810
 It cost under 10 dollars 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.740
 there cloud magic he applications can 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.460
 become free and here they price 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.500
 it is written but for free how much earlier 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.570
 it cost how much it costs now 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.540
 maybe tomorrow she will be again 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.340
 cost the same price and maybe even 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.650
 cost more than before the sale 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.570
 because prices are constantly changing 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.350
 grows up one month costs 30 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 another 60 volume has become smaller and if 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.110
 you will sleep during discounts 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.540
 you can save a lot because 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.350
 there are many criteria and sky is enough 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.850
 convenient but apart from this list 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.180
 there is still 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.250
 list with applications that are cheaper but 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.550
 they are completely free and for example but 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.709
 cost 10 dollars left cost 5 for 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.250
 this is there also a sales section for 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.090
 Search there are categories differently when 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.970
 new applications here have an application 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.360

 my applications are written above them 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.230
 count sync app 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.290
 which is not yet synchronized which 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.570
 just downloaded the appstore and there is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.290
 notifications when something becomes 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.140

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.890
 and the price when you bought this 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.380
 the version you have for example there is still 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.830
 Markings on the left is the price of red. 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.000
 increased while buying and updating 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.470
 update for gta came out for home itself and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.430
 for others 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.430
 price see for example tex grabber cost 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.320
 differently and the infinity blade is completely 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.470
 the other was the price now it is already higher and 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.470
 so the price rises red flag 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.100
 hangs you can see how much 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.950

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.549
 how much does my application cost and 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.040
 srail categories 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.530
 if you need to look for something specifically 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 there is not only 1 sales application here 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.810
 but in general everything is easy for easy searching 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.910
 created section 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.489
 Well, for example, the book section is opening 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.780
 just have a search term by 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.239
 which can be searched for 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.820

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.840
 Something is not such not such corrupt tuners 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:37.060
 the main section of this application is again 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.160

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.680
 set as you need to look for something 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.960
 there is a rating itself something else and 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.270
 the list of applications is very large 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.150
 this is exactly the feature i'm in 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.000
 salaries of similar applications here 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.900
 a lot of things collected and very 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.780
 not bad you can save if I have 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.000
 5054 rubles you write in the comments on 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.430
 how many have you synchronized there 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.860

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.490
 sync new apps that i'm 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.930
 downloaded already after the last time 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.550
 synced in general and you should 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.680
 sync all your apps 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.539
 which you have installed but as you can see 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.600
 happens pretty quickly takes 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:26.610
