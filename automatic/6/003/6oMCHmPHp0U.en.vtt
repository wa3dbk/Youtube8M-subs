the pull activate is RCC immunity and
then<00:03:10.639> short<00:03:10.879> lesson<00:03:11.299> number<00:03:11.389> 3<00:03:11.750> guys<00:03:11.930> blocking

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
then short lesson number 3 guys blocking

then short lesson number 3 guys blocking
art<00:03:12.709> CCU<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.669> in<00:03:13.819> this<00:03:13.970> game<00:03:14.180> there's<00:03:14.419> a<00:03:14.480> lot<00:03:14.720> of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
art CCU so in this game there's a lot of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.259 
art CCU so in this game there's a lot of
cc's<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.069> can<00:03:16.250> block<00:03:16.519> them<00:03:16.699> here<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.030> an

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
cc's so you can block them here is an

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.270 
cc's so you can block them here is an
example<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.900> state<00:03:18.139> is<00:03:18.260> blocking<00:03:18.709> going<00:03:19.099> for

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
example the state is blocking going for

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.390 
example the state is blocking going for
stone<00:03:19.459> face<00:03:19.840> uppercut<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.650> get<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:21.980> damage

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
stone face uppercut it get the damage

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000 
stone face uppercut it get the damage
but<00:03:22.639> the<00:03:23.000> CC<00:03:23.359> doesn't<00:03:23.660> go<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:23.959> issue<00:03:24.470> now<00:03:24.799> is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
but the CC doesn't go to issue now is

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.839 
but the CC doesn't go to issue now is
top<00:03:25.810> blocking<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.250> successfully<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.280> get<00:03:28.639> the

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
top blocking and successfully I get the

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.629 
top blocking and successfully I get the
stun<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:29.659> now<00:03:30.319> there<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.560> switcher<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:31.190> on

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
stun and now there is switcher and on

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.399 
stun and now there is switcher and on
the<00:03:31.760> blocking<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:32.389> block<00:03:32.629> just<00:03:32.870> on<00:03:33.079> fist

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
the blocking and I block just on fist

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.970 
the blocking and I block just on fist
block<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.430> pool<00:03:34.639> so<00:03:35.329> as<00:03:35.389> you<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.629> see<00:03:35.690> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
block the pool so as you can see a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.339 
block the pool so as you can see a
blocking<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.159> very<00:03:37.720> useful<00:03:38.720> because<00:03:38.840> sometime

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
blocking is very useful because sometime

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.439 
blocking is very useful because sometime
you<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.620> if<00:03:40.040> you're<00:03:40.340> able<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.639> block<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.239> good

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
you can if you're able to block the good

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.110 
you can if you're able to block the good
the<00:03:41.629> good<00:03:41.780> cc's<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.979> worth<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.609> now<00:03:44.060> we

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
the good cc's it's worth it and now we

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.659 
the good cc's it's worth it and now we
just<00:03:44.359> try<00:03:44.659> to<00:03:44.979> see<00:03:45.979> if<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:46.220> works

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
just try to see if it works

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.879 
just try to see if it works
can<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.359> see<00:03:47.540> see<00:03:47.659> from<00:03:47.840> behind<00:03:48.079> no<00:03:48.440> even<00:03:48.799> if

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
can you see see from behind no even if

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.710 
can you see see from behind no even if
your<00:03:49.040> block<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.489> get<00:03:49.639> by<00:03:49.760> behind<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.540> is

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
your block and you get by behind this is

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.699 
your block and you get by behind this is
it<00:03:50.870> doesn't<00:03:51.139> work

it doesn't work

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.830 
it doesn't work
so<00:03:52.190> now<00:03:52.340> let's<00:03:52.549> let<00:03:52.879> take<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.120> look<00:03:53.150> at<00:03:53.419> lesson

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
so now let's let take a look at lesson

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.330 
so now let's let take a look at lesson
number<00:03:53.959> 4<00:03:54.379> testing<00:03:54.979> soft<00:03:55.519> CC<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.079> I<00:03:57.440> will<00:03:57.859> be

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
number 4 testing soft CC so I will be

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.399 
number 4 testing soft CC so I will be
this<00:03:58.790> time<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.150> slave<00:03:59.389> so<00:03:59.690> II<00:03:59.930> starting<00:04:00.290> with

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
this time to slave so II starting with

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.259 
this time to slave so II starting with
uppercut<00:04:00.919> there<00:04:01.159> so<00:04:01.579> I<00:04:01.609> want<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.849> see<00:04:02.000> if<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
uppercut there so I want to see if the

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.360 
uppercut there so I want to see if the
hard<00:04:02.510> CC<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.079> soft<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.500> he<00:04:03.620> can<00:04:03.829> mix<00:04:04.190> together

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
hard CC and soft is he can mix together

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.479 
hard CC and soft is he can mix together
so<00:04:05.150> an<00:04:05.299> immunity<00:04:05.840> for<00:04:06.169> 5<00:04:06.440> second<00:04:06.889> artsy<00:04:07.220> ceased

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
so an immunity for 5 second artsy ceased

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.789 
so an immunity for 5 second artsy ceased
and<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.879> route<00:04:08.090> works<00:04:08.419> so<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.199> can<00:04:09.379> make<00:04:09.560> art

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
and the route works so you can make art

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.550 
and the route works so you can make art
CC<00:04:10.159> and<00:04:10.340> then<00:04:10.549> go<00:04:11.209> with<00:04:11.389> a<00:04:11.419> soft<00:04:11.870> caesium<00:04:12.379> and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
CC and then go with a soft caesium and

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.280 
CC and then go with a soft caesium and
you<00:04:12.709> see<00:04:12.889> I<00:04:12.919> can<00:04:13.280> block<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:14.030> route<00:04:14.359> by<00:04:15.019> dodge

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
you see I can block this route by dodge

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.720 
you see I can block this route by dodge
rolling<00:04:15.709> but<00:04:15.859> I'm<00:04:16.039> losing<00:04:16.400> my<00:04:16.519> stamina<00:04:16.900> so

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
it's a good example here on how to use

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.170 
it's a good example here on how to use
the<00:04:22.120> mix<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.540> RTC<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.140> sub<00:04:23.620> cc's<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.000> hope

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
the mix of RTC and sub cc's so I hope

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.970 
the mix of RTC and sub cc's so I hope
