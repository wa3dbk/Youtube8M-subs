in<00:02:01.680> my<00:02:01.890> hand<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:03.060> buy<00:02:03.330> into<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.500> kind<00:02:04.740> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
in my hand and buy into so it's kind of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.830 
in my hand and buy into so it's kind of
a<00:02:05.010> balancing<00:02:05.520> act<00:02:05.670> between<00:02:05.880> everything<00:02:06.479> here

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
good I have a couple issues with it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.000 
good I have a couple issues with it
number<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.360> even<00:03:20.230> with<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.530> amount<00:03:20.740> of<00:03:20.800> mail

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
number one even with the amount of mail

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.860 
number one even with the amount of mail
that<00:03:21.220> they<00:03:21.250> put<00:03:21.520> on<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.760> thing<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.570> still

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
that they put on this thing it still

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.990 
that they put on this thing it still
tastes<00:03:23.170> kind<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.530> dry<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.700> think<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
tastes kind of dry and I think the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.310 
tastes kind of dry and I think the
reason<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.390> because<00:03:25.510> there's<00:03:25.990> no<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.230> not

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
reason is because there's no it's not

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080 
reason is because there's no it's not
like<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.500> sauce<00:03:26.830> it's<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.310> mayo<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.580> mayo<00:03:27.880> can

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
like a sauce it's just mayo and mayo can

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.810 
like a sauce it's just mayo and mayo can
be<00:03:28.150> very<00:03:28.380> thick<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.800> so<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.520> doesn't<00:03:30.760> really

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
be very thick and so it doesn't really

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.160 
be very thick and so it doesn't really
distribute<00:03:31.180> well<00:03:31.510> when<00:03:31.690> you're<00:03:31.810> eating<00:03:31.930> it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
distribute well when you're eating it

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.990 
distribute well when you're eating it
and<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.890> end<00:03:32.980> up<00:03:33.100> with<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.250> drier<00:03:33.490> case<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
and you end up with a drier case and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.280 
and you end up with a drier case and
especially<00:03:34.210> because<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.660> fluffiness<00:03:35.050> of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
especially because of the fluffiness of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.420 
especially because of the fluffiness of
the<00:03:35.380> bunt<00:03:35.590> remember<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:35.890> said<00:03:36.040> this<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.280> not<00:03:36.310> a
