00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.870
 at the beginning today is a very tutorial 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.639
 special because today is my day 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.830
 birthday and I'll show you how to make 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.810
 a delicious birthday cake without 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.939
 oven because I know that you try 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.500
 the recipes and normal part decorates it 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.630
 from one of my favorite characters that 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.070
 they are the valve minions the first time 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.810
 that with a cake in the form of 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.730
 character and although it was somewhat difficult 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.380
 it was also very funny if you never 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.720
 you have decorated a cake in the shape of 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.520
 character you must have a lot of patience and 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.150
 You will see that in the end you will have a beautiful 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.190
 cake and look how it's done 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.620
 to start making the cake you're going to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.720
 need 400 grams of chocolate to 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.540
 melt this can be bitter or semi 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.670
 bitter 400 milliliters of milk and 4 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.950
 eggs first place a pot with water 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.930
 and then above it a smaller one 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.090
 this is to melt the chocolate to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.920
 bain marie with the very short flame of your 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.480
 stove you're going to start putting this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 chocolate in the pot when you see that you 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.230
 chocolate begins to melt in the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.940
 constantly down model constantly 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.460
 this is to prevent our 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.260
 chocolate does not burn 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.000
 when your chocolate is already all of 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740
 retirement in the beginning to see what comes out 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.760
 very nice you're going to start putting the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.160
 milk and you'll stir it little by little 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.080
 after the milk add 4 eggs without 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.970
 stop moving 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.220
 was vÃ©lez constantly and when 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.360
 I began to see that you go out in burbujitas 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.340
 to put out the fire 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.200
 Now we are going to cover a refractory with 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.790
 aluminum foil and let's start to 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 assemble our cake for that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.820
 we need square cookies from 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.550
 we get these vanilla in the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.410
 supermarket and water with soluble coffee the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.330
 water has to be warm no matter the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.430
 amount of coffee that you put this alone 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.560
 try me if you like it like this is perfect 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 and to give more flavor to the coffee I 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.740
 I'll put some coffee liqueur if 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.960
 you do not have it at home does not matter 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 you can skip this step now let's 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.070
 start putting your cookies in the coffee 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.420
 you're going to soak them do not leave them that much 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.580
 time because if they do not get wet 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.220
 too much and they break you're going to try and 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.220
 you are going to put them in your refractory 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.810
 since it ends is putting a layer of 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.880
 cookies now follows a layer of our 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 chocolate again was a layer of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.780
 cookies then chocolate and so they go 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.150
 to do until you have four layers of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 cookies since you finished putting the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.100
 four layers of cookies now with paper 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.590
 waxed or aluminum foil you will cover it 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.410
 the important thing here is that this has to 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.240
 be all well compressed then what 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.730
 what we are going to do is start 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.500
 press it to press even more 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.230
 I'm going to put another refractory from it 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.270
 size on top of my cake you're going to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.190
 Leave in the freezer for 5 hours to 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.140
 that everything is fine while your 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.450
 cake is in the freezer in a bowl 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.790
 you are going to put 500 milliliters of cream 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.470
 beat and a quarter cup of icing sugar 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.840
 or equal to zenit or sugar so that it does not 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.459
 lumps and you're going to beat all this 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.870
 is to create our bitumen if you 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.240
 you prefer you can buy it in the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.100
 supermarket now with a fork you're going to 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.140
 beat a cream cheese bar for 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.290
 then add our mix and you go 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.299
 to continue beating 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.010
 when you start to see those peaks that are 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.780
 do in the cream means that it is already 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.640
 what we are going to do now is give 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.620
 bitumen color to decorate our 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.620
 this cake is going to be yellow 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.170
 since you had the yellow color 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.969
 of the child you will continue with the other 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.129
 while putting it in the refrigerator now 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.080
 you're going to start painting the bitumen for the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.390
 pants this is blue 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.490
 finally you are going to paint a bit of bitumen 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.410
 of color black this coloring you can 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.000
 get where they sell materials 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.250
 premiums when you have finished painting 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680
 your bitumen I put all of them to the reflection and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.840
 here your cake froze now you're going to 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.670
 take it out you will start to extend your 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.500
 aluminum does not matter that the above does not 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.230
 have frozen now what we're going 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.480
 to do is cut and shape the child 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.700
 first you're going to start cutting with the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.700
 knife the tips to make it oval 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.230
 now on a table oppose aluminum 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.540
 you're going to put upside down to flip 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.420
 the cake places another table below and with 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.950
 help from someone around the cake 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.560
 then you're going to remove the aluminum and the 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.480
 excess chocolate in your cake we are going to 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.220
 start putting the shoe polish but for that 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.370
 let's mark how far they will go 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.380
 your pants 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.900
 let's start with the top 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.970
 and this is yellow you're going to put 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.060
 enough bitumen to cover all that 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.060
 part and with a spatula you're going to start 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.060

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.560
 now let's put on his pants 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.510
 to make the child's eyes I'm going to 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.030
 use two round cheese crackers 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.880
 cream and chocolate was from the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.740
 cheese square in half now 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.300
 I take a cookie cutter and dip 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.320
 in warm water to make it easier 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.350
 cut the cheese 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.000
 and you're going to put your cookie like this 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.070
 finish your eyes you will take a 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.560
 knife to remove some cheese and 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.650
 you are going to put the chocolate as if it were 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.250

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.860
 our minion now with a bag one 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.420
 pastry bag and a tip like this we're going to 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.700
 start putting the details with the 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.720
 black bitumen begins to draw the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.720
 lenses from the inside out 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.940
 now you are going to use a tip like this 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.940
 to mark the final lines 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.770
