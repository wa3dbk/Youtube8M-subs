cooler upgrading to this for a number of

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.930 
cooler upgrading to this for a number of
reasons<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.620> want<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.070> get<00:00:14.219> I'm<00:00:14.610> upgrading

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
reasons one I want to get I'm upgrading

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.590 
reasons one I want to get I'm upgrading
from<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.480> stock<00:00:15.929> cpu<00:00:16.350> fan<00:00:16.770> which<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:18.060> not<00:00:18.240> bad

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
from my stock cpu fan which it's not bad

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.420 
from my stock cpu fan which it's not bad
but<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.320> definitely<00:00:19.500> could<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.859> better<00:00:20.100> it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
but it definitely could be better it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.740 
but it definitely could be better it's
going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> make<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> make<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
going to make this is going to make it a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
going to make this is going to make it a
little<00:00:21.869> quieter<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.560> well<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:22.859> i'll<00:00:23.039> give<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
little quieter as well as i'll give it a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.210 
little quieter as well as i'll give it a
lot<00:00:24.150> better<00:00:24.269> performance<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> also<00:00:25.590> allow<00:00:26.099> me

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
lot better performance and also allow me

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
lot better performance and also allow me
to<00:00:26.310> overclock<00:00:26.820> eventually<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.510> i<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.750> ahead

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to overclock eventually when i go ahead

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.349 
to overclock eventually when i go ahead
and<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.849> solutions<00:00:29.849> cut<00:00:30.029> right<00:00:30.179> into

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and do that solutions cut right into

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.550 
and do that solutions cut right into
this<00:00:30.539> i'm<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.170> making<00:00:31.320> an

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this i'm also going to be making an

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
actual cooler to take that out and I'll

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.370 
actual cooler to take that out and I'll
just<00:02:18.270> set<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.480> aside<00:02:18.630> we'll<00:02:18.960> get<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> closer

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
just set it aside we'll get a closer

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.750 
just set it aside we'll get a closer
look<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:21.060> second<00:02:22.610> we've<00:02:23.610> also

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
look at that in just a second we've also

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.570 
look at that in just a second we've also
got<00:02:24.210> our<00:02:24.600> hardware<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> ton<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.860> screws<00:02:26.340> for

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
got our hardware so a ton of screws for

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.420 
got our hardware so a ton of screws for
this<00:02:27.110> set<00:02:28.110> those<00:02:28.320> aside<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:31.100> take<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> rest

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
this set those aside and take the rest

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.060 
this set those aside and take the rest
of<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> stuff<00:02:32.910> out<00:02:33.120> real<00:02:33.390> fast<00:02:33.860> we've<00:02:34.860> also

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
of the stuff out real fast we've also

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.930 
of the stuff out real fast we've also
got<00:02:37.070> throw<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:40.430> read<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.910> not

actually<00:02:50.340> easy<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.880> follow<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.450> got<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.980> ton

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
actually easy to follow it's got a ton

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.250 
actually easy to follow it's got a ton
of<00:02:53.010> pictures<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.360> I'm<00:02:54.600> probably<00:02:54.990> going

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
of pictures on it so I'm probably going

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.110 
of pictures on it so I'm probably going
to<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.470> using<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.370> maybe<00:02:56.490> some<00:02:56.730> YouTube

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
to be using that and maybe some YouTube

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.550 
to be using that and maybe some YouTube
videos<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.690> I'll<00:02:57.810> put<00:02:57.990> my<00:02:58.110> own<00:02:58.230> installation

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
videos but I'll put my own installation

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.520 
videos but I'll put my own installation
video<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.220> me<00:02:59.520> trying<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> figure<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.180> out

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
video of me trying to figure it out

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.170 
video of me trying to figure it out
let's<00:03:01.530> take<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.800> closer<00:03:02.310> look<00:03:02.460> at<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> actual

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
let's take a closer look at the actual

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.260 
let's take a closer look at the actual
cooler<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:04.160> actually<00:03:05.160> went<00:03:05.490> into<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> store<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
cooler I actually went into the store to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.960 
cooler I actually went into the store to
buy<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.420> h-60<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:08.280> was<00:03:08.460> only<00:03:08.670> twenty

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
buy the h-60 this was only twenty

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
buy the h-60 this was only twenty
dollars<00:03:09.240> more<00:03:09.480> again<00:03:09.810> because<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.380> on

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
dollars more again because this was on

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.790 
dollars more again because this was on
sale<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.760> also<00:03:11.940> figured<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.620> girl

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
sale and I also figured that the girl

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.380 
sale and I also figured that the girl
told<00:03:13.980> me<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.580> was<00:03:14.730> going<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.910> overclock

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
told me that if I was going to overclock

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.080 
told me that if I was going to overclock
the<00:03:15.890> h-60<00:03:16.890> would<00:03:17.130> allow<00:03:17.340> me<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.610> do<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> little

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the h-60 would allow me to do a little

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.340 
the h-60 would allow me to do a little
bit<00:03:18.300> of<00:03:18.330> overclocking<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.260> is

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
bit of overclocking but this is

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.600 
bit of overclocking but this is
definitely<00:03:19.500> going<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.830> give<00:03:19.980> me<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.130> lot<00:03:20.370> more

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
definitely going to give me a lot more

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.790 
definitely going to give me a lot more
power<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:23.720> availability<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.020> overclock<00:03:25.530> so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
power and availability to overclock so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.979 
power and availability to overclock so
here<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.160> we've<00:03:26.760> got<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.510> cooler<00:03:27.750> right
