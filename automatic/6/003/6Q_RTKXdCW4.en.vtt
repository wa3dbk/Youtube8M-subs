00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.539 

well<00:00:03.720> as<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> medical<00:00:04.859> student<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.370> always

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
well as a medical student I always

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.849 
well as a medical student I always
thought<00:00:05.850> I'd<00:00:06.000> be<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.210> primary<00:00:06.569> care<00:00:06.990> doc<00:00:07.259> I

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
thought I'd be a primary care doc I

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.950 
thought I'd be a primary care doc I
think<00:00:08.160> that's<00:00:08.340> all<00:00:08.790> I'd<00:00:09.030> been<00:00:09.210> exposed<00:00:09.660> to

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
think that's all I'd been exposed to

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.830 
think that's all I'd been exposed to
I've<00:00:10.110> always<00:00:10.320> had<00:00:10.590> an<00:00:10.740> interest<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.160> art<00:00:11.429> and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
I've always had an interest in art and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.030 
I've always had an interest in art and
realized<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.929> probably<00:00:13.530> wasn't<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
realized that probably wasn't going to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.730 
realized that probably wasn't going to
be<00:00:14.099> something<00:00:14.370> I'd<00:00:14.580> make<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> living<00:00:15.210> at<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.740> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
be something I'd make a living at and so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160 
be something I'd make a living at and so
I<00:00:16.770> think<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.660> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.930> things

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
I think you know as just kind of things

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.800 
I think you know as just kind of things
begin<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> evolve<00:00:19.970> had<00:00:20.970> some<00:00:21.180> interest<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
begin to evolve had some interest in the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.349 
begin to evolve had some interest in the
sciences<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.680> high<00:00:23.160> school<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.670> college<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
sciences in high school in college and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.620 
sciences in high school in college and
ended<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.289> rotating<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> guide<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.970> did

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
ended up rotating with a guide that did

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.290 
ended up rotating with a guide that did
a<00:00:27.660> variety<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.349> things<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.490> thought<00:00:29.880> well

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
a variety of things and thought well

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.580 
a variety of things and thought well
that's<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> want<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.790> we<00:00:32.790> were<00:00:33.090> in

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
that's what I want to do we were in

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.069 
that's what I want to do we were in
Indianapolis<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.790> practice<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.690> until

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
Indianapolis as a practice up until

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.360 
Indianapolis as a practice up until
about<00:00:37.170> three<00:00:37.320> years<00:00:37.770> ago

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
about three years ago

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.990 
about three years ago
and<00:00:38.840> just<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.050> space<00:00:40.320> considerations<00:00:40.800> had<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and just for space considerations had to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
and just for space considerations had to
look<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> place<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.920> had<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.280> bit

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
look for a place that had a little bit

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.209 
look for a place that had a little bit
more<00:00:44.520> space<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.239> ended<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.200> moving<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.770> Carmel

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
more space and ended up moving to Carmel

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.380 
more space and ended up moving to Carmel
but<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.820> say<00:00:48.030> our<00:00:48.270> our<00:00:49.230> patient<00:00:49.860> base<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
but I would say our our patient base is

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.029 
but I would say our our patient base is
Indianapolis<00:00:51.390> wide<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.020> actually<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
Indianapolis wide and actually it's a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.330 
Indianapolis wide and actually it's a
really<00:00:53.219> statewide<00:00:54.980> actually<00:00:55.980> some<00:00:56.579> upstate

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
really statewide actually some upstate

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
really statewide actually some upstate
even<00:00:59.340> though<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.940> everyday<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> know

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
even though I do this everyday you know

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
even though I do this everyday you know
I<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.160> when<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.640> you're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
I know what it's like when you're you're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
I know what it's like when you're you're
sitting<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> patient's<00:01:04.530> side<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
sitting on the the patient's side of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.289 
sitting on the the patient's side of
things<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> completely<00:01:06.000> different

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
things it's a completely different

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
things it's a completely different
feeling<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
feeling and I think if you know that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
feeling and I think if you know that
you've<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.700> somebody<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:10.020> does

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you've got somebody that really does

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.070 
you've got somebody that really does
care<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.360> an<00:01:12.570> interest<00:01:12.869> in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
care and that really has an interest in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.530 
care and that really has an interest in
taking<00:01:13.830> care<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> wanting<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> keep

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
taking care of you and wanting to keep

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450 
taking care of you and wanting to keep
your<00:01:15.810> best<00:01:16.080> interest<00:01:16.560> always<00:01:17.130> set<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
your best interest always set the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
your best interest always set the
forefront<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.049> me

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
forefront I think that would make me

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
forefront I think that would make me
feel<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> whole<00:01:19.680> lot<00:01:19.740> better<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.869> hopefully

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
feel a whole lot better and so hopefully

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.380 
feel a whole lot better and so hopefully
that's<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.320> patients<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:22.799> feeling<00:01:23.390> our

that's what my patients are feeling our

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
that's what my patients are feeling our
