00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
on their s5000 tablet well of course you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.920 
on their s5000 tablet well of course you
can<00:00:50.399> call<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> plastic<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.690> did

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

can call it plastic but the way they did
the<00:00:52.110> finish<00:00:52.500> makes<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.250> makes<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> feel<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the finish makes it makes it feel and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
the finish makes it makes it feel and
I'm<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.170> expensive<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> more

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I'm kind of more expensive and more

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.479 
I'm kind of more expensive and more
premium<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.600> definitely<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
premium and I definitely like this so it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
premium and I definitely like this so it
comes<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> 13<00:01:00.210> megapixel<00:01:00.300> camera<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
comes with a 13 megapixel camera on the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.130 
comes with a 13 megapixel camera on the
back<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> 2<00:01:03.030> megapixel<00:01:03.149> camera<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.899> the

back as a 2 megapixel camera on the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.630 
back as a 2 megapixel camera on the
front<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:04.979> they're<00:01:05.129> saying<00:01:05.369> over

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
front that's what they're saying over

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.030 
front that's what they're saying over
even<00:01:06.000> though<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.170> told<00:01:07.500> us<00:01:07.680> doing

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
even though i think they told us doing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830 
even though i think they told us doing
another<00:01:08.280> video<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> 5

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
another video that it would be a 5

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.890 
another video that it would be a 5
megapixel<00:01:10.049> camera<00:01:10.680> anyway<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.970> were<00:01:12.000> not

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
megapixel camera anyway so we were not

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.980 
megapixel camera anyway so we were not
so<00:01:13.049> sure<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.830> never<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.810> an
