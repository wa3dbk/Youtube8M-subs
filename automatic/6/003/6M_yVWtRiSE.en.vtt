 Western Europe and your language so 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.170
 French when you do 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
 you make save and here you have 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.070
 installed league of legends on a mac 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.410
 I will show you some pictures in 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.460
 game to warn you a few small 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.460
 bugs that can pop up 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:41.130
 so here's how you can see 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 a window opens so you put 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.970
 your your identifiers if you have them 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:54.830
 one or otherwise you have to register 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:56.780
 on the site you wait here 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.590
 and so you have the same menu as on 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.920
 windows and / or knee I will show you 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.420
 some pictures in game 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.090
 I started not long ago at this 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.650
 game so I'm still a small level 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 I want to put a little I created a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.070
 small part counting a rest to their 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.070
 khat hours 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.900
 so there you choose your character 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.910
 their choice that it's every week that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.990
 the characters change 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.090
 once you have chosen in passing 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.990
 that the seizures are locked and you 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.670
 so wait there are several skins of 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.700
 characters I do not really know what 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.220
 what you can buy 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.230
 and there the screen will leave the Valais 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.430
 passion 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.640
 do not panic it's normal 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.580
 wait another window will appear 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.930
 so she appeared if the menu except 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.230
 that since there is nothing you are the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.730
 memories and that's the big change 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:14.690
 just appeared to wait a bit 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:14.690
 who appear and that's it 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.080
 and here is league of legends launched 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.100
 on a mac 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.350
 you have your loading screen which 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.350
 is a bit long we must admit 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.080
 the only flaw that I noticed is 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.570
 we can not enlarge the window 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.010
 when you have a big mac like me 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.210
 it's a bit awkward especially when you 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.960
 do not want to look at the bottom 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.960
 screen that has behind 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.980
 so still a little wait 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.500
 Hello 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.500
 all living 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.690

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.750
 video capture that costs alps their 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.560
 who takes a little air and who manufactures 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.790
 radiators by brings back a little more 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.790
 early and you 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.430

00:05:47.510 --> 00:06:02.450
 graphics and it's like that so so 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:05.480
 a video resolution yes me we can 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.660
 put in full screen mode i'm going to 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.610
 see me now sorry then there is a 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.010
 little bug if you put the quality of 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.900
 very high characters so I do not have 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.280
 had to put in more if you put the 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.420
 character quality is very high 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.160
 as you can see we do not see 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.960
 nothing 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.020
 the characters are invisible or 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.860

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.340

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.260
 character 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.440

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.000
 means video I was characters go 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:41.080

 good there is quai then this is one of 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.550
 bugs that I often encounter when I 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.200
 played against two he has but online I 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.500
