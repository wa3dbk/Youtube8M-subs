00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
circles in the United States I think

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.270 
circles in the United States I think
that<00:01:06.530> should<00:01:06.680> change

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.310 

I<00:01:09.340> think<00:01:10.150> that<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.570> Orchestra<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.110> New<00:01:11.170> York

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
I think that this Orchestra the New York

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.230 
I think that this Orchestra the New York
Philharmonic<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.920> particularly<00:01:12.490> suited<00:01:13.030> to

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
Philharmonic is particularly suited to

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.149 
Philharmonic is particularly suited to
play<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.570> music<00:01:13.869> with<00:01:14.170> Nielsen<00:01:14.409> it's<00:01:14.710> it's

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
play the music with Nielsen it's it's

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.530 
play the music with Nielsen it's it's
it's<00:01:15.570> rich<00:01:16.570> lush<00:01:17.200> romantic<00:01:18.390> music<00:01:19.390> that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
it's rich lush romantic music that

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.649 
it's rich lush romantic music that
demands<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.259> kind<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:20.680> commitment<00:01:21.159> of<00:01:21.580> sound<00:01:22.180> of

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
demands a kind of commitment of sound of

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.630 
demands a kind of commitment of sound of
technique<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.770> precision<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.520> the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
technique the precision that the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
technique the precision that the
orchestra<00:01:24.970> can<00:01:25.150> bring<00:01:25.450> along<00:01:25.750> with<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.200> with

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
orchestra can bring along with the with

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740 
orchestra can bring along with the with
the<00:01:26.860> beauty<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.250> sound<00:01:27.550> is<00:01:27.759> just<00:01:28.000> exactly<00:01:28.149> what

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
the beauty of sound is just exactly what

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.380 
the beauty of sound is just exactly what
the<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.440> music<00:01:29.830> needs<00:01:33.090> there's<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.180> kind

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
the what the music needs there's a kind

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.289 
the what the music needs there's a kind
of<00:01:34.509> way<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.860> these<00:01:36.220> symphonies<00:01:36.700> are<00:01:36.729> treated

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
of way that these symphonies are treated

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.160 
of way that these symphonies are treated
in<00:01:38.040> Scandinavia<00:01:39.040> in<00:01:39.280> Denmark<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.990> think

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
in Scandinavia in Denmark and I think

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.040 
in Scandinavia in Denmark and I think
necessarily<00:01:41.649> since<00:01:42.070> I'm<00:01:42.670> not<00:01:42.970> from<00:01:43.539> there<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
necessarily since I'm not from there and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.350 
necessarily since I'm not from there and
since<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.500> Orchestra<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.220> not<00:01:45.759> from<00:01:46.179> there

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
since this Orchestra is not from there

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.090 
since this Orchestra is not from there
and<00:01:46.600> since<00:01:46.960> there's<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.229> kind<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.530> freshness<00:01:47.830> to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
and since there's a kind of freshness to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580 
and since there's a kind of freshness to
the<00:01:48.250> experience<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.750> musician<00:01:50.170> but<00:01:50.409> it's

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the experience of the musician but it's

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380 
the experience of the musician but it's
to<00:01:50.710> say<00:01:50.860> many<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.460> them<00:01:51.640> are<00:01:51.729> playing<00:01:52.000> these

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
to say many of them are playing these

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.660 
to say many of them are playing these
pieces<00:01:52.659> for<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> first<00:01:53.259> time<00:01:53.500> what<00:01:54.340> they<00:01:54.490> say

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
pieces for the first time what they say

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.749
