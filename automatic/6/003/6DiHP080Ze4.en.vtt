the map slums using the type 25 and what

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.630 
the map slums using the type 25 and what
I<00:00:20.789> think<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.630> guess<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> could<00:00:22.230> say<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
I think the I guess you could say a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.189 
I think the I guess you could say a
coolest<00:00:23.640> thing<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.180> game<00:00:24.390> play<00:00:24.660> or

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
coolest thing about this game play or

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.990 
coolest thing about this game play or
the<00:00:25.260> reason<00:00:25.710> why<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.279> good<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the reason why I think it's so good is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
the reason why I think it's so good is
just<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> fact<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.230> only<00:00:28.410> lethal<00:00:28.619> kill

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
just the fact that the only lethal kill

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
just the fact that the only lethal kill

lot of people aren't gonna know what I'm

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.910 
lot of people aren't gonna know what I'm
even<00:01:48.840> talking<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.470> because<00:01:49.770> you've<00:01:49.890> never

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
even talking about because you've never

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.679 
even talking about because you've never
seen<00:01:50.340> snow<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.880> life<00:01:51.060> which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.360> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
seen snow in your life which is just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
seen snow in your life which is just
crazy<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.460> been<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.090> seems

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
crazy because that's been like it seems

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.999 
crazy because that's been like it seems
like<00:01:54.720> three<00:01:55.020> quarters<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> year<00:01:55.530> just

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
like three quarters of the year just

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.490 
like three quarters of the year just
drowning<00:01:56.340> snow<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.290> case

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
drowning snow but that's not the case

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.700 
drowning snow but that's not the case
actually<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.990> know<00:02:00.990> winter<00:02:01.290> always<00:02:01.500> seems

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
actually I know winter always seems

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.050 
actually I know winter always seems
longer<00:02:01.950> than<00:02:02.159> summer<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.759> don't<00:02:02.969> know

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
longer than summer for me I don't know

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
longer than summer for me I don't know
why<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.960> feels<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> way

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
why that is it just feels that way

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.910 
why that is it just feels that way
sometimes<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.329> thought<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.710> snow

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
sometimes but I thought a it's a snow

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.230 
sometimes but I thought a it's a snow
day<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.640> better<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
day what better to do then

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.450 
day what better to do then
make<00:02:10.570> commentary<00:02:11.290> because<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:12.190> know<00:02:12.280> it's

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
make commentary because you know it's

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.680 
make commentary because you know it's
not<00:02:12.580> really<00:02:12.730> much<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> do<00:02:13.240> around<00:02:13.390> here

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
not really much to do around here

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.810 
not really much to do around here
especially<00:02:14.170> when<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.650> bad<00:02:15.280> weather<00:02:15.520> like

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
especially when it's bad weather like

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.570 
especially when it's bad weather like
this<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.630> yeah<00:02:17.440> um<00:02:19.110> right<00:02:20.110> here<00:02:20.350> guys<00:02:20.530> I'd<00:02:21.250> have

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
this so yeah um right here guys I'd have

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
this so yeah um right here guys I'd have
to<00:02:21.730> say<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.390> was<00:02:22.630> one<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> easiest

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to say that this was one of the easiest

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.360 
to say that this was one of the easiest
100-plus<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.700> ever<00:02:24.820> got<00:02:25.090> ah<00:02:25.330> yeah<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.770> my

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
100-plus as I ever got ah yeah the my

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.800 
100-plus as I ever got ah yeah the my
streaks<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.910> kind<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.150> flowed<00:02:28.600> together

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
streaks just kind of flowed together

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.220 
streaks just kind of flowed together
really<00:02:29.320> well<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:31.540> know<00:02:31.630> something<00:02:31.900> with

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
really well and you know something with

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.830 
really well and you know something with
the<00:02:32.440> visa<00:02:32.920> EMP<00:02:33.580> set<00:02:33.880> up<00:02:34.030> no<00:02:34.240> matter<00:02:34.360> what<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the visa EMP set up no matter what the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.810 
the visa EMP set up no matter what the
third<00:02:35.050> streak<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.830> really<00:02:36.550> really

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
third streak is is really really

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.760 
third streak is is really really
powerful<00:02:37.120> especially<00:02:38.110> if<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.530> something

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
powerful especially if it's something

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.400 
powerful especially if it's something
that's<00:02:39.100> anything<00:02:39.550> higher<00:02:40.060> than<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.450> visa<00:02:40.840> EMP

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
that's anything higher than the visa EMP

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.370 
that's anything higher than the visa EMP
because<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.910> assists<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.990> get<00:02:44.230> from

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
because the assists that you get from

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.740 
because the assists that you get from
those<00:02:44.830> two<00:02:44.860> things<00:02:45.310> come<00:02:45.700> well<00:02:46.360> combined

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
those two things come well combined

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.870 
those two things come well combined
together<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.250> know<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.520> visa

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
together because the you know the visa

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.820 
together because the you know the visa
shows<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.390> where<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.690> whole<00:02:50.140> enemy<00:02:50.260> team<00:02:50.440> is

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
shows you where the whole enemy team is

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.460 
shows you where the whole enemy team is
and<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.570> you're<00:02:52.840> gonna<00:02:53.020> get<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> lot<00:02:53.410> of

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
and you know you're gonna get a lot of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.810 
and you know you're gonna get a lot of
assists<00:02:53.890> from<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.190> because<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.490> teammates

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
assists from that because your teammates

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.640 
assists from that because your teammates
gonna<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.090> getting<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.360> lot<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.540> kills<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.080> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
gonna be getting a lot of kills and the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.340 
gonna be getting a lot of kills and the
EMP<00:02:57.280> which<00:02:57.880> will<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.510> know<00:02:58.600> just<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.960> doubling

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
EMP which will you know just be doubling

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.840 
EMP which will you know just be doubling
your<00:02:59.470> assist<00:02:59.800> points<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.250> not<00:03:00.370> only<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.640> but

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
your assist points and not only that but

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.230 
your assist points and not only that but
it<00:03:01.030> distorts<00:03:01.570> your<00:03:01.600> enemy<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.790> V<00:03:03.970> set

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
it distorts your enemy so with the V set

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.970 
it distorts your enemy so with the V set
and<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.570> EMP<00:03:05.020> going<00:03:05.290> up<00:03:05.380> at<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.530> same<00:03:05.620> time

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
and the EMP going up at the same time

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.770 
and the EMP going up at the same time
there's<00:03:06.370> really<00:03:06.580> not<00:03:06.790> much<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.240> chance<00:03:07.480> for

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
there's really not much of a chance for

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.020 
there's really not much of a chance for
the<00:03:07.840> enemy<00:03:08.110> team<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:09.250> really<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.820> great

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the enemy team so it really is a great

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.640 
the enemy team so it really is a great
Street<00:03:10.480> combo<00:03:10.840> if<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.990> guys<00:03:11.140> haven't<00:03:11.350> tried

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
Street combo if you guys haven't tried

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.410 
Street combo if you guys haven't tried
it<00:03:11.680> it's<00:03:11.950> kind<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.340> hard<00:03:12.670> streak<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.180> pin

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
it it's kind of a hard streak to pin

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.540 
it it's kind of a hard streak to pin
together<00:03:13.840> but<00:03:14.380> once<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.710> do<00:03:14.920> get<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.280> can

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
together but once you do get it you can

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.310 
together but once you do get it you can
go<00:03:15.700> through<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:16.030> quite<00:03:16.330> often<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:17.020> really

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
go through it quite often it's really

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.610 
go through it quite often it's really
not<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.500> hard<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:18.130> loop<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.640> next<00:03:18.910> V<00:03:19.060> set

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
not that hard to loop to the next V set

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.810 
not that hard to loop to the next V set
depending<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:21.010> what<00:03:21.130> your<00:03:21.250> third<00:03:21.460> streak

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
depending on what your third streak
