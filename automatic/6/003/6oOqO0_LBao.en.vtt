00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 warning if you're a maraco culiado 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 that is scared with any shit and not 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
 You want to ruin your childhood 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.450
 recommend not watch this music video 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.450
 teacher 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.189
 but what's up boss why the fuck 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.740
 you put music because you said that 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.840
 put music was not just sarcasm 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.840
 now put the video ok ready 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.360
 one day I was playing mini craft in 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 my so advanced world which had 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.460
 made pyramids castles and mansions 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.830
 even libraries once was already of 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.450
 night I always play in art so 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.460
 it was rare that the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.320
 monsters but I did not care 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.510
 It was probably a game error 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.910
 keep playing and I realized that no 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.190
 there was no kind of animal the thing was 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.290
 It was strange to keep playing and I found 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.360
 that I had nothing in my inventory I re 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.280
 hot because I had many diamonds and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.980
 everything but I do not scare and keep playing 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.440
 when I go to my inventory I see that my 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.899
 character did not have pupils since I started 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.670
 to scare then I went to the mini forum 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.160
 craft that creates a theme but nobody 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.289
 he commented not even something weird came in 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.479
 I went back to the mini craft and I was 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.090
 all the most normal what surprised me is 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.100
 There was a character I was standing there 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.080
 I went to but nothing happened suddenly 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.030
 the screen went black and when I 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.009
 I wanted to remember the ghost was not there 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.380
 Then I closed and opened the mini 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.600
 craft turned the typical ghost me 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.520
 I approached and returned the screenshot but my 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.530
 Skillful reflections left that I could 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.570
 take a picture with the track 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.729
 screenshot was a red letters that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.400
 they said beautiful self that in English is be you 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.070
 I did not understand the message but I went back to 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.200
 close and open the mini craft as it was 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.030
 wait for the ghost reappeared 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.350
 turned the screen and I went back to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.509
 capture it with the frac 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.790
 this time he said this is not a game in 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.250
 English this is not a game so the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.170
 whole message says be yourself this does not 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.990
 it's a game I still do not understand the message 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.240
 I went back to close and open the game came back to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.610
 appear the ghost but this time it's 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.039
 very scared because the ghost floated and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.810
 not only that he had red eyes and 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.150
 when I got closer the game came out 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.500
 before I gave a screenshot I went back to 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.750
 capture with him 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 fraps the message said this is a killer 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.370
 game in Spanish this is a killer game 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.250
 the desk was filled with files 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.350
 pdf were documents of dead people that 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 he died while playing mini craft and that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 he had run into the same character 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.040
 create a topic in the forum and upload all the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.080
 files eventually minecraft closed 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.150
 for a while until they found the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.579
 responsible for what they found the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.050
 user was never discovered but in his 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.790
 new version achieved 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.890
 erase the character but it has not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.590
 found I never reopened that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.780
 version of the nine craft now with the 1.6 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.390
 I'm calm I've even loved it 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.680
 its news but I wonder what will be 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.680
 been with that character
