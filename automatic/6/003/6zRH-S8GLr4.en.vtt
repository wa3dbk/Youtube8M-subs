00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.849
 hello everyone and as always welcome back 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.449
 in my new video today I do you 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.019
 see the lobbies modified by mode 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.279
 for 3 where the points are not like 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.039
 previously in my other videos 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:32.539
 I showed you that they were 60 thousand 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:36.410
 points and other things in a nutshell here 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:39.920
 let's say they are every year for example 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:47.390
 now i'm doing confirmed killing 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.010
 every confirmed kill is is a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.539
 point 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.449
 that is, you make a confirmation we say that you 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.789
 make a prestige just that 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.980
 obviously it works 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.370
 salt for now only works for 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.070
 who had the modified presence however and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.540
 for those who also have level 80 for 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 example those who have level 80 and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.730
 make all these points do not lose 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.520
 they do n't call them from the game though 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.170
 oh well it can be useful if they want 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.080
 go up in the rankings for example me 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.280
 now with this agreement here an hour e 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.990
 something and that is about type 27 of the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.420
 ranking and nothing 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.810
 other people will click 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.860
 automatically from the game and then 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.630
 I hope that practically it will leave a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.090
 other and barrel that also works for 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.039
 other people are like that at least 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.429
 that for normal ones so at least not 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.920
 you must lose time the lobbies from 60 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.570
 thousand points because sincerely yes 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.159
 he really loses so much time instead 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.990
 with this you have suffered, that is, you put 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.159
 case that make a lobby that everyone 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.729
 how many can do it 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.950
 they commit suicide once and then I can 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.920
 immediately ended the game ends 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
 game and another game starts 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.239
 that is, without waiting for everyone 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.790
 they reach 60,000 that all of them 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.340
 arrive at level 80 this one with a 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.680
 suicide for example a suicide if you are 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.730
 a suicide and a domain game 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.069
 capture 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.709
 instead here to the confirmed killing o 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:34.540
 assist or know what it's called a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.820
 confirmation and nothing here you are seeing it 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.220
 that I'm taking all those points but 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.380
 obviously they are taking it from me 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.290
 the other people also know how to leave 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.049
 the other agent, however, only those who 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.440
 they have level 80 so don't ask me 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.040
 of 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.180
 to lobby in this manner of 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.540
 enter to let you join my group 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.180
 because otherwise then you just do 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.370
 something chicano you is automatically 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.870
 they also click me think if we're in 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.310
 group 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.340
 if you want to enter only to go up by 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.989
 don't add me to this ranking 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:21.540
 contact here because I don't know yet if 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:23.580
 if I use it as a contact for for 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.670
 play the former drivers because I would like to do 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.280
 I do not know I would like to bring it to the first to the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.629
 first level in the standings and then the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.100
 I would like to work for charity 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.420
 here on youtube I will make a video where 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.320
 I don't know how to do it like a lottery 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.220
 we said that 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.080
 and you must write the number you don't 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.430
 I know if I do from an accent or a 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.120
 number you like 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.290
 then all the numbers I will mark a date 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.350
 expiration all the numbers there 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.440
 I'll put what I do like I say 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.980
 lottery that I know I put them in a 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.820
 a box then the first one to come out 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.820
 takes the account 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.680
 I think it's a good thing 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:20.950
 obviously the participants are also needed 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:24.650
 because otherwise I make a lottery alone 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.690
 and nothing here is seeing me from everyone 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.420
 these points here to normally if you have 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.920
 normal points that you don't have 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.390
 seasoned pv from a mile 11 waist 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.070
 instead you are seeing me give me three 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.830
 point because oi mundi i doubles and nothing 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.000
 with this cohesive the idea immediately 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.650
 of course it is a bit difficult 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.770
 in fact, it takes the ranking first 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.870
 I'm still trying 27 bit hard 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.390
 since they have quite a few 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.220
 changed the ranking so let's say 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.320
 that it takes quite a while 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.020
 this seems to me to work killing 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.370
 confirmed ok then it seems to me the domain 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.730
 yes you can guess 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.180
 I don't know if it also works in the neighborhood 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.470
 general and in demolition I don't remember 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.920
 well 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.650
 however here you also see the mini 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.420
 great map the super promod that the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.280
 super promod is not that i only see it 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.110
 but you also see it as the super promoter 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.950
 that would be the one with the elongated weapon 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:30.140
 which is already a good method of strength or if 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:32.300
 so we say more or less good 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.300
 see the large large map av 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.910
 obviously this this and booth laga a 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.690
 quite a bit wide a lot because 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:49.400
 it put too much stuff in there though 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:51.710
 oh well we are satisfied and that I can 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.260
 say more if you liked this 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.470
 video subscribe to my channel as 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.080

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:15.590

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.810

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.000
 ex game recorder remembers the wind both 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.160
 full then as I have already told you not 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.820
 add on this here because I don't know 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.290
 if I do become one of mine 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.640
 main because I want to do that 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.710
 what there 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:39.980
 it may be he will create another and I will put 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.210
 I will use the one there to do this xp 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.760
 lobby 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:49.270
 and nothing is everything for today 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.770
 even for today it's all I hope there is 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.440
 liked this video that you don't have 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.920
 tired and see you at the next hello 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.920
 boys
