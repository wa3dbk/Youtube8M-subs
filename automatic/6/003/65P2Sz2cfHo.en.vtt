00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.360 

so<00:00:03.240> for<00:00:03.480> our<00:00:03.570> first<00:00:03.840> limit<00:00:04.200> problem<00:00:04.770> we're

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
so for our first limit problem we're

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.099 
so for our first limit problem we're
gonna<00:00:05.460> look<00:00:05.670> at<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.910> limit<00:00:06.060> as<00:00:06.299> X<00:00:06.540> approaches

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
gonna look at the limit as X approaches

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.610 
gonna look at the limit as X approaches
2<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.410> x<00:00:08.069> squared<00:00:08.400> minus<00:00:08.820> 4<00:00:09.120> over<00:00:09.599> X<00:00:10.139> minus<00:00:10.590> 2

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
2 of x squared minus 4 over X minus 2

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.539 
2 of x squared minus 4 over X minus 2
and<00:00:11.990> again<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> idea<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.650> we're<00:00:14.040> putting<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and again the idea is we're putting in

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
and again the idea is we're putting in
numbers<00:00:14.730> close<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.719> 2<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.320> we're<00:00:16.470> trying<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
numbers close to 2 and we're trying to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
numbers close to 2 and we're trying to
see<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.190> types<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.609> numbers<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.510> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
see what types of numbers we get out of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.689 
see what types of numbers we get out of
course<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.800> could<00:00:19.920> always<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
course you could always do this on a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.720 
course you could always do this on a
calculator<00:00:20.939> plug<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.750> 1.9<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:23.250> point<00:00:23.550> nine

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
calculator plug in 1.9 one point nine

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.960 
calculator plug in 1.9 one point nine
nine<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.449> point<00:00:25.080> nine<00:00:25.260> nine<00:00:25.320> nine<00:00:25.760> put<00:00:26.760> each

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
nine one point nine nine nine put each

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
nine one point nine nine nine put each
of<00:00:27.119> those<00:00:27.269> numbers<00:00:27.720> into<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> formula<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
of those numbers into the formula and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
of those numbers into the formula and
see<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> numbers<00:00:29.910> you're<00:00:30.060> getting<00:00:30.300> out

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
see if the numbers you're getting out

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
see if the numbers you're getting out
are<00:00:30.689> getting<00:00:30.929> close<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> something

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
are getting close to something

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
are getting close to something
but<00:00:32.550> again<00:00:32.820> these<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.239> kind<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.600> give<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
but again these can kind of give you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.170 
but again these can kind of give you
deceiving<00:00:34.200> results<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.640> maybe<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
deceiving results because maybe if you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
deceiving results because maybe if you
plug<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.870> point<00:00:37.050> nine<00:00:37.350> nine<00:00:37.710> nine<00:00:37.739> nine

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
plug in one point nine nine nine nine

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
plug in one point nine nine nine nine
nine<00:00:38.370> nine<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.510> something<00:00:39.870> much

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
nine nine you get something much

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.709 
nine nine you get something much
different<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.550> general<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> test

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
different you can in general on a test

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.330 
different you can in general on a test
or<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:43.020> exam<00:00:43.079> they're<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.739> want<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
or an exam they're gonna want to see you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.619 
or an exam they're gonna want to see you
do<00:00:44.460> something<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:45.000> algebraic<00:00:45.780> anyway<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
do something more algebraic anyway so to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
do something more algebraic anyway so to
get<00:00:48.750> started<00:00:48.960> again<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.039> always<00:00:50.520> try<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> make

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
get started again you always try to make

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840 
get started again you always try to make
it<00:00:51.360> x<00:00:51.600> equals<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> substitute<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> see

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it x equals and substitute it in and see

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.810 
it x equals and substitute it in and see
what<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.800> plug<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> x<00:00:56.640> equals

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
what you get so if i plug in x equals

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.810 
what you get so if i plug in x equals
two<00:00:57.239> notice<00:00:57.840> i<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.140> 2<00:00:58.410> squared<00:00:58.829> which<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> 4

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
two notice i get 2 squared which is 4

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
two notice i get 2 squared which is 4
minus<00:01:00.350> 4<00:01:01.489> over<00:01:02.489> 2<00:01:02.760> minus<00:01:03.149> 2<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:04.439> getting<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
minus 4 over 2 minus 2 I'm getting this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.020 
minus 4 over 2 minus 2 I'm getting this
form<00:01:05.400> zero<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.210> zero<00:01:07.340> which<00:01:08.340> means<00:01:08.610> hey

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
form zero over zero which means hey

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.250 
form zero over zero which means hey
we're<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.110> more

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
we're gonna have to be a little more

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.030 
we're gonna have to be a little more
creative<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.950> figure<00:01:11.280> something<00:01:11.580> else<00:01:11.820> out

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
creative and figure something else out

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
creative and figure something else out
well<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.520> where<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.820> factoring<00:01:15.240> skills

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
well this is where your factoring skills

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
well this is where your factoring skills
kick<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:17.100> notice<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
kick in because notice that you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.300 
kick in because notice that you can
factor<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> numerator<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.470> x<00:01:19.619> squared<00:01:19.950> minus

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
factor the numerator the x squared minus

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.160 
factor the numerator the x squared minus
four

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.340 

as<00:01:26.380> X<00:01:27.380> minus<00:01:28.130> 2<00:01:29.470> X<00:01:30.470> plus<00:01:30.710> 2<00:01:31.630> well<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.659> have<00:01:32.899> this<00:01:33.020> X

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
as X minus 2 X plus 2 well I have this X

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.580 
as X minus 2 X plus 2 well I have this X
minus<00:01:33.500> 2<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.280> bottom<00:01:34.430> I<00:01:34.880> can<00:01:35.750> cancel<00:01:36.200> that

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
minus 2 on the bottom I can cancel that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.190 
minus 2 on the bottom I can cancel that
out<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.180> what<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.479> do<00:01:38.659> with<00:01:38.780> limits

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
out and this is what you do with limits

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.920 
out and this is what you do with limits
you<00:01:39.380> try<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.649> do<00:01:39.860> something<00:01:40.210> algebraic<00:01:41.210> so

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
you try to do something algebraic so

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.800 
you try to do something algebraic so
that<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.170> can<00:01:42.320> simplify<00:01:42.710> them<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.659> then<00:01:44.659> you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
that you can simplify them and then you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.690 
that you can simplify them and then you
basically<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.380> repeat<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.039> plug<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.520> chug

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
basically just repeat the plug and chug

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.940 
basically just repeat the plug and chug
process<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.630> try<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.869> plug<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.259> number<00:01:48.710> back

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
process you try to plug the number back

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.010 
process you try to plug the number back
in<00:01:49.220> again<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:49.850> hopefully<00:01:50.539> you'll<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:50.960> a

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
in again and hopefully you'll get a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.920 
in again and hopefully you'll get a
solution<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.920> in<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:52.580> case<00:01:52.850> if<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.210> plug<00:01:53.509> in<00:01:53.720> x

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
solution and in this case if I plug in x

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.440 
solution and in this case if I plug in x
equals<00:01:54.110> 2<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:54.860> no<00:01:55.039> longer<00:01:55.310> dividing<00:01:55.939> by<00:01:56.090> 0

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
equals 2 I'm no longer dividing by 0

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.359 
equals 2 I'm no longer dividing by 0
I'll<00:01:57.350> get<00:01:57.649> 2<00:01:57.950> plus<00:01:58.250> 2<00:01:58.550> or<00:01:58.990> 4<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.380> that's<00:02:01.159> the

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
I'll get 2 plus 2 or 4 and that's the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.850 
I'll get 2 plus 2 or 4 and that's the
answer<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.850> my<00:02:01.970> limit<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.659> says<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.470> limit<00:02:03.649> as

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
answer to my limit it says the limit as

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.430 
answer to my limit it says the limit as
X<00:02:04.009> approaches<00:02:04.490> 2<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.789> x<00:02:05.179> squared<00:02:05.509> minus<00:02:05.899> 4<00:02:06.170> over

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
X approaches 2 of x squared minus 4 over

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.740 
X approaches 2 of x squared minus 4 over
X<00:02:07.340> minus<00:02:07.759> 2<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.239> going<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.509> equal<00:02:08.720> 4<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:11.630> you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
X minus 2 is going to equal 4 and if you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.840 
X minus 2 is going to equal 4 and if you
graph<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.260> function<00:02:12.709> x<00:02:12.920> squared<00:02:13.220> minus<00:02:13.580> 4

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
graph the function x squared minus 4

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.809 
graph the function x squared minus 4
over<00:02:13.880> X<00:02:14.450> minus<00:02:14.840> 2<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.680> gonna<00:02:15.920> look<00:02:16.220> just<00:02:16.280> like

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
over X minus 2 it's gonna look just like

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.990 
over X minus 2 it's gonna look just like
the<00:02:17.060> graph<00:02:17.299> of<00:02:17.569> y<00:02:17.840> equals<00:02:18.319> x<00:02:18.500> plus<00:02:18.980> 2<00:02:19.010> which<00:02:19.970> is

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
the graph of y equals x plus 2 which is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.170 
the graph of y equals x plus 2 which is
a<00:02:20.150> straight<00:02:20.600> line<00:02:21.100> except<00:02:22.100> for<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:22.880> going<00:02:23.090> to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
a straight line except for it's going to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.259 
a straight line except for it's going to
be<00:02:23.299> undefined<00:02:23.690> at<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.739> value<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.400> 2<00:02:25.850> because

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
be undefined at the value of 2 because

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.170 
be undefined at the value of 2 because
that<00:02:26.569> gives<00:02:26.720> me<00:02:26.810> 0<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.380> denominator<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.190> I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
that gives me 0 in the denominator so I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.370 
that gives me 0 in the denominator so I
made<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> little<00:02:29.959> graph<00:02:30.260> here<00:02:31.540> here<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
made a little graph here here is the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.039 
made a little graph here here is the
graph<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.890> y<00:02:33.950> equals<00:02:34.549> x<00:02:34.760> squared<00:02:34.940> minus<00:02:35.480> 4<00:02:35.780> over

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
graph of y equals x squared minus 4 over

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:42.009 
graph of y equals x squared minus 4 over
X<00:02:36.560> minus<00:02:36.980> 2<00:02:37.090> notice<00:02:38.090> at<00:02:38.390> 2<00:02:38.750> its<00:02:39.470> undefined<00:02:41.019> but

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
X minus 2 notice at 2 its undefined but

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.259 
X minus 2 notice at 2 its undefined but
again<00:02:42.470> visually<00:02:43.130> if<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.459> look<00:02:43.670> at<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.970> graph

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
again visually if you look at this graph

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.870 
again visually if you look at this graph
it<00:02:44.660> says<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.320> we<00:02:45.410> take<00:02:45.590> x<00:02:45.829> coordinates<00:02:46.489> closer

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
it says if we take x coordinates closer

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.539 
it says if we take x coordinates closer
and<00:02:47.180> closer<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.630> closer<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.200> 2<00:02:48.410> from<00:02:49.250> either

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
and closer and closer to 2 from either

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.620 
and closer and closer to 2 from either
side

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
side

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.720 
side
notice<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.769> Y<00:02:51.980> coordinates<00:02:52.340> are

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
notice that the Y coordinates are

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.199 
notice that the Y coordinates are
getting<00:02:52.940> closer<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.450> closer<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.170> 4<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:56.030> that's

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
getting closer and closer to 4 so that's

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.630 
getting closer and closer to 4 so that's
the<00:02:56.390> way<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.600> read<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.320> limit<00:02:57.769> off<00:02:57.920> from<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.340> graph

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the way to read a limit off from a graph

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.090 
the way to read a limit off from a graph
basically<00:02:59.630> think<00:03:00.079> what's<00:03:00.350> X<00:03:00.560> getting<00:03:00.859> close

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
basically think what's X getting close

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.430 
basically think what's X getting close
to<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.700> then<00:03:02.030> look<00:03:02.269> at<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.480> graph<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.019> think

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
to and then look at the graph and think

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680 
to and then look at the graph and think
what<00:03:03.859> y-coordinate<00:03:04.730> am<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.940> getting<00:03:05.120> close<00:03:05.420> to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
what y-coordinate am I getting close to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.860 
what y-coordinate am I getting close to
in<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.620> case<00:03:06.859> 4<00:03:07.310> notice<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.420> doesn't<00:03:08.780> even

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
in this case 4 notice it doesn't even

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.259 
in this case 4 notice it doesn't even
matter<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.620> undefined<00:03:10.040> at<00:03:10.609> 2<00:03:10.880> that's

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
matter that it's undefined at 2 that's

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.370 
matter that it's undefined at 2 that's
perfectly<00:03:11.810> acceptable<00:03:12.019> when<00:03:12.709> we<00:03:12.829> do<00:03:12.980> limits
