my<00:06:29.430> personal<00:06:29.970> trainer<00:06:30.030> was<00:06:30.780> very<00:06:31.080> good<00:06:31.290> at

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
my personal trainer was very good at

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.200 
my personal trainer was very good at
guessing<00:06:31.590> what<00:06:31.830> weights<00:06:32.220> I<00:06:32.460> would<00:06:32.640> need<00:06:32.790> for

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
guessing what weights I would need for

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.200 
guessing what weights I would need for
which<00:06:33.360> muscle<00:06:33.750> groups<00:06:34.280> but<00:06:35.280> she<00:06:35.580> was<00:06:35.730> way<00:06:35.940> off

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
which muscle groups but she was way off

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.700 
which muscle groups but she was way off
in<00:06:36.600> my<00:06:37.110> triceps<00:06:37.680> and<00:06:38.040> my<00:06:38.820> lats

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
in my triceps and my lats

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.049 
in my triceps and my lats
apparently<00:06:40.710> all<00:06:41.040> of<00:06:41.130> this

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:43.059 
apparently all of this

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:46.089 
apparently all of this
it's<00:06:44.059> really<00:06:44.330> good<00:06:44.479> for<00:06:44.719> my<00:06:44.839> lats<00:06:45.110> which<00:06:45.589> is

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
it's really good for my lats which is

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.529 
it's really good for my lats which is
why<00:06:46.249> I<00:06:46.279> don't<00:06:46.430> have<00:06:46.819> you<00:06:46.999> know<00:06:47.029> the<00:06:47.210> giant

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
why I don't have you know the giant

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.950 
why I don't have you know the giant
slabs<00:06:47.779> a<00:06:47.960> back<00:06:48.139> fat<00:06:48.379> even<00:06:49.249> though<00:06:49.339> I<00:06:49.369> should

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
slabs a back fat even though I should

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.540 
slabs a back fat even though I should
because<00:06:50.960> I<00:06:51.080> have<00:06:51.229> pretty<00:06:51.830> good<00:06:51.889> muscle<00:06:52.309> under

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
because I have pretty good muscle under

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.059 
because I have pretty good muscle under
there<00:06:52.699> and<00:06:53.020> my<00:06:54.020> triceps<00:06:54.439> we<00:06:54.649> think<00:06:54.889> it's

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
there and my triceps we think it's

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.909 
there and my triceps we think it's
probably<00:06:55.369> from<00:06:55.789> drumming<00:06:56.589> but<00:06:57.589> they're

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
probably from drumming but they're

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.089 
probably from drumming but they're
stronger<00:06:58.460> than<00:06:58.729> my<00:06:58.879> biceps<00:06:59.589> it<00:07:00.589> should<00:07:00.800> not<00:07:00.919> be

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.099 
stronger than my biceps it should not be

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:06.639 
stronger than my biceps it should not be
the<00:07:01.249> case<00:07:02.229> but<00:07:03.229> other<00:07:03.919> than<00:07:04.129> that<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:06.050> am<00:07:06.439> a

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:06.649 
the case but other than that I am a

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:07.959 
the case but other than that I am a
little<00:07:06.919> stronger<00:07:07.189> than<00:07:07.309> I<00:07:07.460> thought<00:07:07.669> I<00:07:07.729> was

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:07.969 
little stronger than I thought I was

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.079 
little stronger than I thought I was

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.089
