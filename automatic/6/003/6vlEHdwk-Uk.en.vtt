00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.069
 well this video will be the virus of the iphone 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.069
 5 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.990
 I will start this video by showing you the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.490
 outside of this device without a doubt 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 This is one of the most 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.439
 elegant in the market currently the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 construction quality of this iphone 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.259
 it is impressive all the details 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.259
 they are fully cared for the weight of this 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.439
 device is 112 grams only his 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.510
 7.6 mm thick and despite being 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.660
 so light and thin it feels very 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.000
 solid and resistant in hand to part 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.769
 of the exterior redesign another big change 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 of this iphone compared to its 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.600
 previous generations is your screen 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 which is now 4 inches with a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.399
 resolution of 1,136 x 640 and its pixels 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.589
 per inch are 326 with the size of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.870
 this new screen now we can see 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.179
 one more row of icons and when we see 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 videos will no longer appear those annoying 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.749
 black lines on the top e 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.460
 lower 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.530
 I hope the video can show what 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.510
 incredibly clear and bright that is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.400
 this screen , it really is 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.020
 impressive without a doubt one of the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.359
 best in the current market 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.210
 the processor that gives life to this iphone 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.060
 is the a6 chip of water which is a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 dual core processor perform the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.149
 benchmark test in this team and 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.979
 as you can see the result was 1660 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.979
 this result duplicates the performance of the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.929
 iphone 4s apart from putting the iphone 5 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.600
 among the most powerful smartphones in 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.640
 current market and achieve this with a chip 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.819
 of only 2 cores which is 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.979
 awesome this iphone without a doubt 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.259
 feels load times very fast 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.819
 of applications are minimal and sometimes 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.880
 that you can find it in the 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.890
 device are practically nil of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 done yet I have not come across any 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.350
 lag 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.869
 Moving on to another topic, let's remember that this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.240
 is a phone make 10 calls from 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.310
 test from different locations and in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.160
 all the quality of signal and audio was 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.800
 excellent the bus that is sent is heard 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.080
 extremely sharp and even when you try 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.120
 to lock me as much as possible the phone 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.880
 I was still receiving a signal of four or 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 five bars so in the section on 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.660
 calls which each time we use 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.820
 except the iphone 5 does a great job 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.530
 a quality that I love about this 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.080
 device is that it can work 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.180
 perfect as a kind of console 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.820
 portable video games I've already tried 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.330
 enough games in it as infinity 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.980
 blade 2 of trigger and asfaw 7 and weigh 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.020
 of being games that require high 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.400
 technical specifications all 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.940
 they work extremely 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.710
 fluid on the iphone 5 in case 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.810
 want to see a little more of gameplays in 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.030
 the iphone 5 on screen is appearing 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
 a link that will take you to a video where 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.350
 I show just that the link also 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.680
 you can find it in the description of 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.689
 this video 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.450
 as for the lightning connector there is no 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.790
 a lot to say is simply that a 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.650
 new connector the only problem is that 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.780
 If you already had accessories for your 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.310
 iphone past now you will have to buy 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.310
 new or buy an adapter 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.090
 the camera of this iphone also improved 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.580
 it's not a drastic improvement compared 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.460
 to the iphone 4s but in general 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.470
 It fulfills an excellent job I've already 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.090
 made a video showing the quality 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.490
 of the iphone 5 cameras 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.780
 so if you want to see the link that is 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.980
 on screen as in the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.080
 description 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.720
 the operating system with which it comes 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.120
 this equipment is adobe 6 which for me 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.099
 it is an excellent ecosystem although this 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.890
 it may vary according to the point of view and 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.200
 tastes of each user the only one fails 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.209
 that I found were the already famous maps 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.340
 of water which to make them 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.500
 honest are not so bad but 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.349
 they just do not compare to the maps 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.510
 of which fortunately google 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.510
 we can have it again on our iphone 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.250
 some other important improvements in 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.940
 this device are the ability to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.620
 support speeds 4g lte also a 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.840
 faster wifi connection than 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.940
 previous generations for whom 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.250
 they ask is also in this 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.799
 device and as for the department 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.410
 audio the iphone 5 now includes these 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.910
 small hearing aids called robots the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.890
 which are a great improvement in 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.950
 comparison to the old hearing aids of 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.350
 water in case you want to know more about 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.510
 them in the description of this video and 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.210
 a link is appearing on the screen 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.310
 a complete review of these hearing aids 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.620
 to conclude I will talk about the time of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.449
 life on this team's battery though 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.660
 In general, I can tell you that it is 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.340
 very good I have not had any problem 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.860
 to last a whole day without having to 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.630
 upload it and this includes some sessions 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.539
 of game apart from being receiving 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.509
 emails constantly and checking networks 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.310
 socially also constantly so 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.500
 on average the battery lasts one or two 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.240
 days depending on the use you give to 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.360
 phone 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.280
 the iphone5 seems to me an excellent 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.889
 device is incredibly fast 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.979
 It has a beautiful large screen 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.020
 design and a selection of applications 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.120
 immense to choose but still with everything 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.310
 this does not seem to me to be necessary 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.250
 change to it if you already have an iphone 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.039
 4s because in reality you will not notice any 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.440
 great change on the other hand if you count 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.389
 with an older computer like an iphone 4 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.190
 for example sure you will notice a 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.889
 very big difference in performance if 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.630
 you change to iPhone 5 and how I just 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.759
 mention this difference will be 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.009
 only in performance because the system 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.199
 operative continues to be practically 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:49.130
 the same in all iPhones that can 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:52.580
 bear young 6 the cost of iphone 5 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:56.949
 unlocked starts at $ 649 per 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:02.860
 the 16 gb version the 32 gb version costs 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:05.080
 749 and 64 GB 849 dollars 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.930
 let me know in the comments what 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.349
 think of iphone5 and if they plan to acquire 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.419
 one if you like this video do not forget 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.879
 give you like sharing it in your networks 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:20.039
 social and subscribe to the channel we 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.039
 we see in the next sticky tech video
