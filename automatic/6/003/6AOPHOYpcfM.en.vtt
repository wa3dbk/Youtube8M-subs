00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

I<00:00:00.240> want<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.290> try<00:00:01.439> progression<00:00:01.949> that's<00:00:02.100> a

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I want to try progression that's a

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.519 
I want to try progression that's a
little<00:00:02.310> bit<00:00:02.429> different<00:00:02.820> in<00:00:02.909> sound<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.810> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
little bit different in sound and the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.740 
little bit different in sound and the
same<00:00:04.770> concepts<00:00:05.400> apply<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:06.060> know<00:00:06.210> following

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
same concepts apply you know following

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.360 
same concepts apply you know following
the<00:00:06.839> chords<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.410> all<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.740> but<00:00:07.919> let's<00:00:08.160> try<00:00:08.309> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
the chords and all that but let's try to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.740 
the chords and all that but let's try to
get<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> different<00:00:08.910> sound<00:00:09.090> from<00:00:09.360> those<00:00:09.540> other

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
get a different sound from those other

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.540 
get a different sound from those other
ones<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.080> we<00:00:10.200> had<00:00:10.320> before<00:00:10.490> progression<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
ones that we had before progression is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.030 
ones that we had before progression is
going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> look<00:00:11.880> like<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.540> minor<00:00:16.190> D<00:00:17.190> minor

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.750 

f

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.849 

and<00:00:25.270> he

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
and he

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.400 
and he
so<00:00:27.400> we<00:00:27.550> have<00:00:27.699> is<00:00:27.910> two<00:00:28.150> minor<00:00:28.509> chords<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.199> two

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
so we have is two minor chords and two

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.010 
so we have is two minor chords and two
major<00:00:29.650> chords<00:00:30.220> okay<00:00:31.090> but<00:00:31.300> it<00:00:31.390> still<00:00:31.660> has<00:00:31.840> this

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
major chords okay but it still has this

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.889 
major chords okay but it still has this
kind<00:00:32.379> of<00:00:32.470> kind<00:00:33.309> of<00:00:33.430> sorrowful<00:00:33.910> sound<00:00:34.390> going<00:00:34.690> on

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
kind of kind of sorrowful sound going on

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.770 
kind of kind of sorrowful sound going on
here<00:00:35.170> we<00:00:35.320> want<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.590> follow<00:00:35.800> each<00:00:36.070> chord<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
here we want to follow each chord of

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.990 
here we want to follow each chord of
course<00:00:38.019> we<00:00:38.199> can<00:00:38.350> obviously<00:00:38.640> follow<00:00:39.640> all

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
course we can obviously follow all

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.790 
course we can obviously follow all
chords<00:00:40.449> by<00:00:40.660> staying<00:00:40.930> in<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.140> key<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.559> minor

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
chords by staying in the key of a minor

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.710 
chords by staying in the key of a minor
we<00:00:42.129> could<00:00:42.340> do<00:00:42.519> that<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:43.000> then<00:00:43.089> be<00:00:43.329> just<00:00:43.449> fine

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
we could do that and then be just fine

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.819 
we could do that and then be just fine
but<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.110> would<00:00:44.230> be<00:00:44.260> like<00:00:44.530> what<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:44.710> was

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
but that would be like what I was

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.229 
but that would be like what I was
talking<00:00:45.100> about<00:00:45.159> before<00:00:45.640> with<00:00:45.760> like<00:00:46.000> what

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
talking about before with like what

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.090 
talking about before with like what
other<00:00:46.390> guys<00:00:46.629> do<00:00:46.870> all<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.110> time<00:00:47.320> we<00:00:47.800> want<00:00:48.010> to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
other guys do all the time we want to

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.770 
other guys do all the time we want to
follow<00:00:48.339> each<00:00:48.640> chord<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.239> best<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.629> our

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
follow each chord to the best of our

abilities so I'm going to give you an

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.660 
abilities so I'm going to give you an
example<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.360> phone<00:00:52.600> these<00:00:52.930> chords<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.739> then

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
example of phone these chords and then

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:53.840 
example of phone these chords and then
I'll<00:00:54.820> start<00:00:55.089> explaining<00:00:55.720> what<00:00:55.930> has<00:00:56.350> gone<00:00:56.620> on

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:06.430 

never

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.310 

okay<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.330> typical<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.140> way<00:02:10.289> I

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
okay that's so typical of the way I

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.860 
okay that's so typical of the way I
would<00:02:10.649> play<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.460> anybody<00:02:11.850> cares<00:02:12.300> about<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
would play so if anybody cares about the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.340 
would play so if anybody cares about the
way<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.050> would<00:02:13.320> particularly<00:02:14.150> play<00:02:15.350> learn

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
way I would particularly play learn

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.199 
way I would particularly play learn
exactly<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.070> just<00:02:17.160> did<00:02:17.400> those<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
exactly what I just did those are the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.720 
exactly what I just did those are the
most<00:02:18.390> common<00:02:18.840> ways<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> follow<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.280> chord

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
most common ways that I follow a chord

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
most common ways that I follow a chord
these<00:02:21.600> chords<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.709> played<00:02:22.980> that's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
these chords that we just played that's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.000 
these chords that we just played that's
just<00:02:23.790> what<00:02:23.940> naturally<00:02:24.390> comes<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.110> let's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
just what naturally comes out and let's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.090 
just what naturally comes out and let's
start<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> break<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.850> down<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.180> little<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
start to break that down a little bit a

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.890 
start to break that down a little bit a
minor<00:02:29.100> chord<00:02:29.430> comes<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:32.600> basically<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.750> can

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
minor chord comes up basically you can

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.170 
minor chord comes up basically you can
use<00:02:34.110> your<00:02:34.410> notes<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> minor<00:02:35.550> scale<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
use your notes your a minor scale or a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.450 
use your notes your a minor scale or a
arpeggio<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> minor<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:38.250> look<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.610> this

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.020 

right<00:02:44.300> that's<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.900> basic<00:02:45.410> one<00:02:46.310> three<00:02:46.700> five

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
right that's your basic one three five

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.600 
right that's your basic one three five
root<00:02:47.570> third<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.110> fifth<00:02:48.260> when<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> D<00:02:49.100> comes<00:02:49.400> up

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
root third and fifth when the D comes up

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.830 
root third and fifth when the D comes up
I<00:02:49.760> start<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.120> get<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.270> little<00:02:50.540> bit<00:02:50.660> more

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
I start to get a little bit more

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.740 
I start to get a little bit more
adventurous<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:52.220> D<00:02:52.400> minor<00:02:52.670> happens<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:55.570> like<00:02:56.570> to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520

it<00:03:33.460> works<00:03:33.760> nicely<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.900> key<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.110> D<00:03:35.230> because

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
it works nicely in the key of D because

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.020 
it works nicely in the key of D because
it's<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.130> key<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.790> minor<00:03:37.060> note<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:39.160> it's

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
it's the key it's a minor note and it's

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.610 
it's the key it's a minor note and it's
also<00:03:40.240> nice<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.720> go<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.140> note<00:03:41.350> because

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
also nice to go to that note because

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.380 
also nice to go to that note because
it's<00:03:41.770> not<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.160> great<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.520> hit<00:03:42.670> that<00:03:42.850> particular

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
it's not so great to hit that particular

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.810 
it's not so great to hit that particular
note<00:03:43.600> over<00:03:43.960> a<00:03:43.990> minor<00:03:44.530> because<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.460> you<00:03:45.520> got<00:03:45.670> a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
note over a minor because if you got a

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.100 
note over a minor because if you got a
minor<00:03:46.030> go<00:03:48.210> it's<00:03:49.210> not<00:03:49.300> really<00:03:49.540> nice<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.900> sit

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
minor go it's not really nice to sit

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.960 
minor go it's not really nice to sit
over<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.500> note<00:03:50.740> in<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.160> minor<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:51.670> nice<00:03:51.820> to

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
over that note in a minor it's nice to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.060 
over that note in a minor it's nice to
pass<00:03:52.150> over<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:56.200> not<00:03:56.320> really<00:03:56.500> nice<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.800> sit<00:03:57.040> on

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
pass over it's not really nice to sit on

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.790 
pass over it's not really nice to sit on
it

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
it

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.040 
it
but<00:03:58.430> when<00:03:58.580> d-minor<00:03:59.000> comes<00:03:59.330> it's<00:03:59.660> totally

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
but when d-minor comes it's totally

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.620 
but when d-minor comes it's totally
great<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.410> sit<00:04:00.590> on<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.830> note<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.190> while

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
great to sit on the note for a while

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.600 
great to sit on the note for a while
so<00:04:03.200> that's<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.470> fresh<00:04:03.740> note<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.280> haven't

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
so that's a fresh note that you haven't

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.970 
so that's a fresh note that you haven't
really<00:04:04.820> sat<00:04:05.150> on<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.690> used<00:04:06.050> up<00:04:06.350> too<00:04:06.620> much<00:04:06.650> in

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
really sat on and used up too much in

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.500 
really sat on and used up too much in
the<00:04:07.070> chord<00:04:07.340> before<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.000> if<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.180> think<00:04:08.330> about

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the chord before so if you think about

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.900 
the chord before so if you think about
that<00:04:08.870> say<00:04:09.380> now<00:04:09.590> it's<00:04:09.800> okay<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.190> use<00:04:10.460> that<00:04:10.700> F

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
that say now it's okay to use that F

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.880 
that say now it's okay to use that F
note<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.390> lay<00:04:11.600> on<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.930> for<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.170> while<00:04:12.350> that's

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
note and lay on it for a while that's

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.230 
note and lay on it for a while that's
why<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.130> kind<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.400> break<00:04:13.610> into<00:04:13.880> that<00:04:14.030> note

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
why I kind of break into that note

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.510 
why I kind of break into that note
commonly<00:04:14.780> over<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.020> D<00:04:15.230> minor<00:04:15.470> chord<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:16.040> then

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
commonly over a D minor chord and then

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.990 
commonly over a D minor chord and then
the<00:04:16.580> F<00:04:16.790> comes<00:04:17.150> up<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.540> F<00:04:17.630> chord<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:19.000> think

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
the F comes up the F chord I think

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.450 
the F comes up the F chord I think
taking<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.810> concept<00:04:21.050> one<00:04:21.620> step<00:04:21.650> further<00:04:22.160> our

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
taking that concept one step further our

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.830 
taking that concept one step further our
note<00:04:22.670> that<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.000> couldn't<00:04:23.330> use<00:04:23.480> on<00:04:23.630> either

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
note that you couldn't use on either

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.620 
note that you couldn't use on either
chord<00:04:24.260> would<00:04:24.380> be<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:24.800> E<00:04:25.010> flat<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:26.360> 'if

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
chord would be like E flat like 'if

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.089 
chord would be like E flat like 'if
right<00:04:26.900> over<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.140> minor<00:04:27.560> would<00:04:27.710> sound<00:04:27.890> like<00:04:27.950> this

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
right over a minor would sound like this

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.459 
right over a minor would sound like this
I'm<00:04:30.580> very<00:04:30.849> pleasant<00:04:31.419> over<00:04:31.779> d-minor<00:04:32.259> would

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
I'm very pleasant over d-minor would

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.770 
I'm very pleasant over d-minor would
sound<00:04:32.680> even<00:04:32.919> worse

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.650 

but<00:04:36.620> if<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.860> wait<00:04:37.190> until<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:38.180> get<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.540> F

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
but if you wait until you get to the F

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.470 
but if you wait until you get to the F
chord<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.910> could<00:04:41.090> play<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:42.670> and<00:04:43.670> pretend<00:04:44.120> not

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
chord you could play it and pretend not

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.240 
chord you could play it and pretend not
pretend<00:04:44.930> just<00:04:45.020> act<00:04:45.320> like<00:04:45.410> you're<00:04:45.680> playing<00:04:46.040> F

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
pretend just act like you're playing F

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.670 
pretend just act like you're playing F
seventh<00:04:46.700> over<00:04:46.970> there<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.690> know<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.530> just

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
seventh over there you know you can just

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.520 
seventh over there you know you can just
go<00:04:48.970> like<00:04:49.970> oh<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> meant<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.870> weird<00:04:51.080> note<00:04:51.350> I

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
go like oh I meant it that weird note I

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.970 
go like oh I meant it that weird note I
meant<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.889> hit<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.310> note<00:04:52.520> there<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:53.150> know

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
meant to hit that note there you know

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.900 
meant to hit that note there you know
basically<00:04:54.980> sounds<00:04:55.370> like<00:04:55.430> you're<00:04:55.610> playing<00:04:55.790> a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
basically sounds like you're playing a

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.120 
basically sounds like you're playing a
seventh<00:04:56.270> there<00:04:56.419> because<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.750> are<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.290> for

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
seventh there because you are and for

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.500 
seventh there because you are and for
the<00:04:58.250> first<00:04:58.490> time<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.820> progression<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.360> can

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
the first time the progression you can

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.750 
the first time the progression you can
use<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.690> he<00:04:59.930> flat<00:05:00.260> so<00:05:00.950> I<00:05:00.980> like<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.310> break<00:05:01.550> out

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
use a he flat so I like to break out

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.210 
use a he flat so I like to break out
that<00:05:01.970> note<00:05:02.240> because<00:05:02.450> it's<00:05:02.750> fresh<00:05:03.050> then<00:05:03.440> so

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
that note because it's fresh then so

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.159 
that note because it's fresh then so
I'll<00:05:04.370> commonly<00:05:04.910> go<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.330> D<00:05:05.690> flat<00:05:05.990> there

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
I'll commonly go to that D flat there

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.629 
I'll commonly go to that D flat there
over<00:05:06.320> F<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.680> then<00:05:06.800> e<00:05:07.010> comes

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.159 

there's<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.270> lot<00:05:10.479> of<00:05:10.599> different<00:05:10.870> things<00:05:11.020> you

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
there's a lot of different things you

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.809 
there's a lot of different things you
can<00:05:11.289> do<00:05:11.439> of<00:05:11.470> our<00:05:11.710> major<00:05:12.009> chord<00:05:12.400> in<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.610> minor

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
can do of our major chord in a minor

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.760 
can do of our major chord in a minor
progression<00:05:13.120> what<00:05:13.599> I<00:05:13.629> did<00:05:13.900> probably<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.560> last

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
progression what I did probably the last

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.589 
progression what I did probably the last
couple<00:05:15.159> times<00:05:15.189> when<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> just<00:05:15.789> improvised<00:05:16.270> was

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
couple times when I just improvised was

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.980 
couple times when I just improvised was
kind<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.729> some<00:05:18.729> lemon<00:05:19.060> we<00:05:19.270> throw<00:05:19.719> in<00:05:19.900> a

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
kind of a some lemon we throw in a

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.459 
kind of a some lemon we throw in a
diminished<00:05:20.590> over<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.759> I<00:05:22.169> probably<00:05:23.169> sold

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
diminished over that I probably sold

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:36.540 
diminished over that I probably sold
like<00:05:23.949> a<00:05:24.219> diminished<00:05:24.849> thing

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.620 

think<00:05:37.550> about<00:05:37.730> a<00:05:37.760> diminished<00:05:38.210> chord<00:05:38.390> if<00:05:38.540> you

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
think about a diminished chord if you

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.210 
think about a diminished chord if you
play<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:39.050> over<00:05:39.200> like<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.710> major<00:05:39.950> in<00:05:40.130> this

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
play it over like a major in this

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.620 
play it over like a major in this
progression<00:05:40.430> three<00:05:41.030> of<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.210> notes<00:05:41.390> are<00:05:41.540> going

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
progression three of the notes are going

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.589 
progression three of the notes are going
to<00:05:41.720> be<00:05:41.840> perfect<00:05:42.350> like

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.359 

that's<00:05:47.139> like<00:05:47.289> an<00:05:47.409> e<00:05:47.499> 7th<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.009> only<00:05:48.189> note

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:48.369 
that's like an e 7th the only note

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:51.950 
that's like an e 7th the only note
that's<00:05:48.610> kind<00:05:48.879> of<00:05:48.909> out<00:05:49.089> there<00:05:49.330> is<00:05:49.479> f<00:05:49.689> /<00:05:50.080> yi

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
that's kind of out there is f / yi

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.960 
that's kind of out there is f / yi
but<00:05:52.560> if<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:52.740> use<00:05:52.860> it<00:05:52.889> kind<00:05:53.130> of<00:05:53.250> as<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.430> passing

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
but if you use it kind of as a passing

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.129 
but if you use it kind of as a passing
note<00:05:54.150> it's<00:05:54.330> going<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.539> really<00:05:54.780> just<00:05:54.960> sound

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
note it's going to really just sound

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:05.970 
note it's going to really just sound
exotic<00:05:55.740> so<00:05:56.610> when<00:05:56.819> the<00:05:56.910> e<00:05:56.940> comes<00:05:57.330> up

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.490 

so<00:06:06.910> typically<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.480> might<00:06:07.750> break<00:06:07.990> into<00:06:08.260> some

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
so typically I might break into some

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.680 
so typically I might break into some
kind<00:06:08.710> of<00:06:08.740> diminished<00:06:09.250> feel<00:06:09.520> there<00:06:09.820> so<00:06:10.540> that's

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
kind of diminished feel there so that's

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.660 
kind of diminished feel there so that's
just<00:06:10.900> kind<00:06:11.200> of<00:06:11.290> some<00:06:11.680> of<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.860> fraud<00:06:12.100> processes

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
just kind of some of the fraud processes

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.980 
just kind of some of the fraud processes
that<00:06:12.880> happen<00:06:13.330> when<00:06:13.480> I'm<00:06:13.630> playing<00:06:13.870> a

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
that happen when I'm playing a

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.750 
that happen when I'm playing a
progression<00:06:14.470> like<00:06:14.500> that<00:06:14.890> and<00:06:15.160> that's<00:06:15.640> a

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
progression like that and that's a

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.000 
progression like that and that's a
really<00:06:15.790> good<00:06:16.360> one<00:06:16.540> to<00:06:16.570> like<00:06:16.930> just<00:06:17.170> tape<00:06:17.710> and

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
really good one to like just tape and

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.710 
really good one to like just tape and
loop<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.340> for<00:06:18.580> awhile<00:06:18.670> and<00:06:18.940> solo<00:06:19.240> over<00:06:19.480> and

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
loop it for awhile and solo over and

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.050 
loop it for awhile and solo over and
then<00:06:19.810> get<00:06:19.960> a<00:06:19.990> feel<00:06:20.290> over<00:06:21.190> what<00:06:21.700> the<00:06:21.790> notes<00:06:21.970> are

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
then get a feel over what the notes are

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.260 
then get a feel over what the notes are
going<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.240> sound<00:06:22.420> like<00:06:22.570> over<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:22.930> chords
