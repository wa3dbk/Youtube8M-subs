what we're gonna do today is apparently
signs<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:05.190> driving<00:00:05.609> around<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.000> little<00:00:06.120> bit

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
looks like it's it looks like a sedan so

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430 
looks like it's it looks like a sedan so
it's<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.940> low<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:15.960> we're<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.230> we've

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it's that low so what we're going we've

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.890 
it's that low so what we're going we've
come<00:00:16.650> down<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.130> EFS<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.180> we've<00:00:18.300> come<00:00:18.480> down<00:00:18.510> to

come down to EFS and we've come down to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.650 
come down to EFS and we've come down to
their<00:00:19.070> their<00:00:20.070> big<00:00:20.369> Brisbane<00:00:20.880> workshop<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
their their big Brisbane workshop and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.929 
their their big Brisbane workshop and
we're<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> put<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.890> three<00:00:23.369> inch<00:00:23.580> lift<00:00:23.850> kit

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
we're going to put a three inch lift kit

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.150 
we're going to put a three inch lift kit
into<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.449> we've<00:00:25.109> come<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.830> set<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
into it we've come up with a set of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
into it we've come up with a set of
springs<00:00:26.609> instead<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> heavy-duty<00:00:27.359> springs

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
springs instead of heavy-duty springs

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
springs instead of heavy-duty springs
that<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> handle<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.730> punishment

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that are going to handle the punishment

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
that are going to handle the punishment
that<00:00:30.900> Simon<00:00:31.500> puts<00:00:31.740> onto<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.160> once<00:00:32.520> he<00:00:32.730> puts<00:00:32.940> his

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that Simon puts onto it once he puts his

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420 
that Simon puts onto it once he puts his
canopy<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:34.050> loads<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.040> up<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
canopy on there loads it up to the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:46.990 
canopy on there loads it up to the
eyeballs<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.120> heads<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.480> north<00:00:41.059> awesome

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.630 

so<00:00:48.000> stick<00:00:48.750> around<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.290> have<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.130> let's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so stick around and have a look let's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
so stick around and have a look let's
see<00:00:50.790> how<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.000> transport<00:00:51.739> Simon's<00:00:52.739> Grand<00:00:53.070> Park

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
see how we transport Simon's Grand Park

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.580 
see how we transport Simon's Grand Park
car<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:54.300> something<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.720> bit<00:00:54.750> tougher

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
car into something a bit tougher

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.860 
car into something a bit tougher
so<00:00:55.949> another<00:00:56.220> bit<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.270> we've<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so another bit so what we've got is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.389 
so another bit so what we've got is
we've<00:00:57.899> pulled<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> suspension<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
we've pulled the suspension out of the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
we've pulled the suspension out of the
front<00:00:59.670> end<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.449> pulled<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.840> radius<00:01:01.350> arms

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
front end and we pulled the radius arms

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.310 
front end and we pulled the radius arms
out<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.519> radius<00:01:02.940> arms<00:01:03.390> control<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
out and the radius arms control the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.430 
out and the radius arms control the
caster<00:01:05.009> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.820> front<00:01:06.090> dip<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> look

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
caster of the front dip so I have a look

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.670 
caster of the front dip so I have a look
over<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.740> we've<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.450> bushes<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.259> need

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
over here we've got the bushes that need

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
over here we've got the bushes that need
to<00:01:10.800> go<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.340> generally<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> would<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to go in so generally that would be in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
to go in so generally that would be in
the<00:01:12.600> centre<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> standard<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.800> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the centre for the standard one but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
the centre for the standard one but
these<00:01:14.790> ones<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.150> offset<00:01:15.659> two<00:01:16.020> degrees<00:01:16.440> now

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
these ones are offset two degrees now

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.650 
these ones are offset two degrees now
that<00:01:16.860> allows<00:01:17.190> when<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> suspension<00:01:18.240> goes<00:01:18.360> up

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
that allows when the suspension goes up

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.840 
that allows when the suspension goes up
it<00:01:19.229> allows<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.740> diff<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.220> roll

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it allows the diff to roll

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
it allows the diff to roll
otherwise<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:22.110> wheels<00:01:22.350> would<00:01:23.070> end<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.369> like

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
otherwise your wheels would end up like

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
otherwise your wheels would end up like
this<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.720> did<00:01:24.899> not<00:01:25.050> like<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> that'd

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this they did not like that and that'd

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
this they did not like that and that'd
be<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> real<00:01:26.490> problem<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.180> steering<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
be a real problem with your steering so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.859 
be a real problem with your steering so
controls<00:01:28.410> your<00:01:28.619> caster<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.850> two<00:01:30.240> degrees<00:01:30.600> goes

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
controls your caster so two degrees goes

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.190 
controls your caster so two degrees goes
into<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> front<00:01:31.530> castor<00:01:32.130> radius<00:01:32.700> arms<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:34.050> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
into the front castor radius arms and it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980 
into the front castor radius arms and it
makes<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.649> jump<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.250> geometry<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.330> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
makes it jump the geometry of the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.740 
makes it jump the geometry of the
steering<00:01:37.530> work<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> what's<00:01:45.300> going<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
steering work so this is what's going in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.969 
steering work so this is what's going in
the<00:01:45.840> front<00:01:46.080> end<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.440> Toyota

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the front end of the Toyota

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.399 
the front end of the Toyota
we<00:01:47.820> got<00:01:48.830> standard<00:01:49.830> Toyota<00:01:50.159> suspension<00:01:51.409> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
we got standard Toyota suspension and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
we got standard Toyota suspension and
what<00:01:53.280> we're<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> stick<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.360> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
what we're going to stick in now this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.319 
what we're going to stick in now this
will<00:01:54.750> give<00:01:54.900> us<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.290> three<00:01:55.530> inch<00:01:55.710> lift<00:01:56.329> including

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
will give us a three inch lift including

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.590 
will give us a three inch lift including
changing<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> bicycle<00:01:58.860> pump<00:01:59.180> or<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> call<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
changing the bicycle pump or I call a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.920 
changing the bicycle pump or I call a
bicycle<00:02:01.259> pump<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.740> steering<00:02:02.189> damn<00:02:02.369> not

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
bicycle pump for the steering damn not
