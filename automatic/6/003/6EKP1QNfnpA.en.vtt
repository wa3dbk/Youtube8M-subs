could've<00:04:31.580> been<00:04:31.699> up<00:04:31.789> since<00:04:31.940> 6:00<00:04:32.240> and

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
could've been up since 6:00 and

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.290 
could've been up since 6:00 and
literally<00:04:33.919> stayed<00:04:34.340> on<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.030> it's<00:04:35.120> just

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
literally stayed on and it's just

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.610 
literally stayed on and it's just
amazing<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.900> really<00:04:36.110> opened<00:04:36.410> some<00:04:36.500> eyes

amazing it really opened some eyes

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.080 
amazing it really opened some eyes
because<00:04:36.979> I<00:04:37.130> never<00:04:37.550> really<00:04:37.760> used<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:37.940> wear

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
because I never really used to wear

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.510 
because I never really used to wear
mascara<00:04:38.419> but<00:04:39.080> mascara<00:04:39.500> really<00:04:39.770> makes<00:04:40.039> a<00:04:40.130> huge

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
mascara but mascara really makes a huge

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.850 
mascara but mascara really makes a huge
difference<00:04:40.550> especially<00:04:40.970> when<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:42.650> have<00:04:42.770> not

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
difference especially when you have not

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.129 
difference especially when you have not
got<00:04:42.979> much<00:04:43.099> I<00:04:43.250> make<00:04:43.490> one<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.840> really

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
got much I make one and it's really

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.560 
got much I make one and it's really
opens<00:04:45.440> up<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.560> eyes<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.039> it's<00:04:46.280> like<00:04:46.310> poof<00:04:46.789> but

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
opens up the eyes and it's like poof but

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.420
