00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.990 

this<00:00:05.799> is<00:00:06.069> my<00:00:06.370> very<00:00:07.090> last<00:00:07.889> one<00:00:08.889> of<00:00:09.040> my<00:00:09.490> second

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
this is my very last one of my second

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.350 
this is my very last one of my second
and<00:00:10.150> my<00:00:10.210> last<00:00:10.770> Valentine's<00:00:11.770> Day<00:00:12.430> tutorial<00:00:13.090> it

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
and my last Valentine's Day tutorial it

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.539 
and my last Valentine's Day tutorial it
is<00:00:13.929> obviously<00:00:14.469> very<00:00:14.530> different<00:00:15.309> than<00:00:15.429> the

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
is obviously very different than the

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.019 
is obviously very different than the
other<00:00:15.730> one<00:00:16.090> so<00:00:16.450> this<00:00:16.630> is<00:00:16.779> more<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.550> opposite

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
other one so this is more the opposite

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.800 
other one so this is more the opposite
of<00:00:19.090> one<00:00:19.330> last<00:00:19.980> video<00:00:20.980> wise<00:00:21.340> and<00:00:21.730> I<00:00:22.300> guess<00:00:22.539> more

of one last video wise and I guess more

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.380
