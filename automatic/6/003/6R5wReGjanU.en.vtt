00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
sort of thing and then you get past

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.810 
sort of thing and then you get past
these<00:01:26.289> statues<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.979> that's<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.549> end<00:01:27.609> of<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
these statues and that's the end of the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.609 
these statues and that's the end of the
stage<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.840> ranked<00:01:29.170> out<00:01:29.289> of<00:01:29.380> 3<00:01:29.560> stars<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
stage it's ranked out of 3 stars and

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.889 
stage it's ranked out of 3 stars and
it's<00:01:33.100> pretty<00:01:33.280> cool<00:01:33.460> like<00:01:33.939> I'm<00:01:34.119> I'm<00:01:34.570> enjoying

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
it's pretty cool like I'm I'm enjoying

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.139 
it's pretty cool like I'm I'm enjoying
it<00:01:35.079> I'm<00:01:35.409> enjoying<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:36.009> much<00:01:36.039> as<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.579> like<00:01:37.000> the

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
it I'm enjoying it as much as I like the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.779 
it I'm enjoying it as much as I like the
original<00:01:37.509> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:41.490> controls<00:01:42.490> work

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
original I think the controls work

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.099 
original I think the controls work
really<00:01:43.179> well<00:01:43.270> they<00:01:43.479> take<00:01:43.659> some<00:01:43.810> getting<00:01:43.869> used

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
really well they take some getting used

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.870 
really well they take some getting used
to<00:01:44.439> simply<00:01:44.829> because<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.249> different<00:01:45.640> kind

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
to simply because it's a different kind

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.910 
to simply because it's a different kind
of<00:01:46.090> control<00:01:47.700> come<00:01:48.700> on<00:01:48.820> now<00:01:48.969> come<00:01:49.179> on<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.920> push

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
of control come on now come on and push

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
of control come on now come on and push
yeah<00:01:51.399> we<00:01:51.789> go

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.370 

and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.720> get<00:01:57.810> past<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and then we are we can get past there so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.850 
and then we are we can get past there so
it's<00:01:58.830> not<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.650> dumb

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it's not just a it's not just a dumb

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's not just a it's not just a dumb
action<00:02:02.070> game<00:02:02.400> you<00:02:02.580> do<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.000> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.330> think

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
action game you do have to kind of think

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
action game you do have to kind of think
about<00:02:03.720> how<00:02:04.290> you're<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.040> through

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
each stage let me show you the stages

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.690 
each stage let me show you the stages
that<00:02:07.470> there<00:02:07.650> are<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.220> know<00:02:08.310> there's<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> fair

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that there are you know there's a fair

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.520 
that there are you know there's a fair
number<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.420> i'm<00:02:09.630> i'm<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.380> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
number as you can see i'm i'm up to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.979 
number as you can see i'm i'm up to
level<00:02:10.679> 11<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.270> massively<00:02:12.720> far

level 11 now so I'm not massively far

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.710 
level 11 now so I'm not massively far
through<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.230> game<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.560> there's<00:02:13.860> tons<00:02:14.489> of
