 dutch pad man a4 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.500
 paints we previously developed 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:54.760
 only 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:58.340
 homogeneous mixed precisely. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.309
 if you are left with a lesson 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.129
 full with some water of course we are no longer 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.920
 we will pour milk at all 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.920
 failed so moistened 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:22.640
 Well, it means that we can also feel like 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.160
 and immediately primed and if left as 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.590
 crazy and since we have a hand 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:41.009
 moves let's i show now on 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 Nolde does not move separately brush or about 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:50.270
 an act, but from a soul 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.270
 same 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.500
 wind and 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.970

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:18.959
 2 more to cut 3 she even thanks 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.959
 primers stick to base 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.519
 so now not yet down account 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.440
 sure we go out have 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:53.489
 go beyond our borders such 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:03:00.280
 drawing this is such a bloom in the field 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:02.909
 It turned out we postpone now 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.909
 a couple 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.760
 then it can be almost like a background 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:35.269
 now take the others tell blue 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:42.290
 put some shades to me like that 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:46.090
 I wanted what she wanted, whatever you want 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.340
 so you can background and do no general 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.500
 solid and with no guidance but if 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.579
 so bright little corner let it be 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.780
 such then as the sun as children 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:03.349
 on the sea, that is, we have up to some 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:08.409

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:33.289
 we will do one more and we still need to 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.389
 there were several fouls so that you could 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.780
 first to practice some elements 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.169
 You can on them and to choose by 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.259
 mood let's say we have one 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:50.110
 dark riding a light pipe let's say 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:55.729
 threats and under some drawing 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:05:03.349
 selective it was possible so another 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:09.590
 I did yes yesterday I wanted to say that 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:13.990

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:21.500
 cool show this item from the center 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:24.099
 you can even make the center one color like that 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.099
 flower 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:52.460

00:05:46.550 --> 00:06:01.680

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:11.700
 on the main thing by the way really 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.560
 just a flower all make a wish or on 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:30.110

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:33.090
 also learns on the room happens too 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.060

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.490
 made 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:46.980
 that we have nothing passes just like that 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:50.450
