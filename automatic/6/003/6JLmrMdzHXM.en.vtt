the instructions that come with aura 22
describes<00:02:09.820> several<00:02:10.179> ways<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.390> fuse<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.899> gold

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
describes several ways to fuse the gold

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.230 
describes several ways to fuse the gold
I<00:02:11.350> usually<00:02:12.010> fuse<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.520> by<00:02:12.610> heating<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.030> piece

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
I usually fuse it by heating the piece

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.760 
I usually fuse it by heating the piece
with<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> torch<00:02:13.780> until<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.260> turns<00:02:14.470> bright<00:02:14.710> red

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
with a torch until it turns bright red

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.190 
with a torch until it turns bright red
then<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.670> hold<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:15.970> color<00:02:16.270> for<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.600> few<00:02:16.780> seconds

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
then I hold that color for a few seconds

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990 
then I hold that color for a few seconds
and<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:18.160> like<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.730> gold<00:02:18.910> is

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
and just like that the gold is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.410 
and just like that the gold is
permanently<00:02:19.570> fused<00:02:20.550> after<00:02:21.550> torch<00:02:21.820> firing<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
permanently fused after torch firing the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.270 
permanently fused after torch firing the
aura<00:02:22.570> 22<00:02:23.050> will<00:02:23.230> be<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> kind<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.740> matte<00:02:23.980> brown

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
aura 22 will be a kind of matte brown

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.490 
aura 22 will be a kind of matte brown
color<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> quick<00:02:25.600> touch<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> burnisher

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
