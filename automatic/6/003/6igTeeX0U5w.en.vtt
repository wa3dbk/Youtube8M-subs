00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that picky when it comes to brands I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.839 
that picky when it comes to brands I
just<00:00:28.320> think<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.560> long<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.010> UVA<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.789> UVB

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
just think as long as it's UVA and UVB

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.600 
just think as long as it's UVA and UVB
protected<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.380> fine<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.160> more

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
protected then it's fine and it's more

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.830 
protected then it's fine and it's more
to<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> texture<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.540> how<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.719> think

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
to do with the texture and how you think

quite nice this is even nice when you're

quite nice this is even nice when you're
at<00:00:54.780> home<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.410> London<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.890> I'm<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
at home and I'm in London and I'm in the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.889 
at home and I'm in London and I'm in the
garden<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.969> easy<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.420> spray<00:00:57.870> on

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
garden this is really easy just spray on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.319 
garden this is really easy just spray on
it<00:00:58.559> doesn't<00:00:58.920> give<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> high<00:00:59.550> coverage<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it doesn't give kind of high coverage so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.880 
it doesn't give kind of high coverage so
I<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> focus<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
I think you do have to focus it more in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.130 
I think you do have to focus it more in
areas<00:01:02.280> where<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> burn<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.449> but

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
areas where you think you burn more but

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
areas where you think you burn more but
it's<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.559> sticky<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.159> feels<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.519> light<00:01:05.790> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's not sticky it feels really light on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
it's not sticky it feels really light on
the<00:01:06.060> skin<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.900> very<00:01:07.080> easy<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.530> apply

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the skin and it's very easy to apply

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
the skin and it's very easy to apply
because<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> spray<00:01:08.670> after<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> few<00:01:09.420> days

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because of the spray after a few days

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
because of the spray after a few days
when<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.840> son's<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.350> used<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> Sun<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
when my son's got more used to the Sun I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.010 
when my son's got more used to the Sun I
like<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.760> down<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.180> 30<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> would

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
like to go down to a 30 but I would

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
like to go down to a 30 but I would
never<00:01:13.200> use<00:01:13.380> anything<00:01:13.650> lower<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.250> 30<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
lower than a 30 really protects your

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
lower than a 30 really protects your
skin<00:01:18.600> again<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> don't<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.710> mind<00:01:20.009> what

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
a lid or anything and so yeah I kind of

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.960 
a lid or anything and so yeah I kind of
prefer<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.659> lotion<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.710> sunbathing<00:01:41.610> which

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
prefer a lotion if I'm sunbathing which

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.340 
prefer a lotion if I'm sunbathing which
I<00:01:42.030> don't<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.899> lying<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I don't really do if I'm lying in the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.929 
I don't really do if I'm lying in the
Sun<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.710> long<00:01:43.829> periods<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.610> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
Sun for long periods of time I think a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.600 
Sun for long periods of time I think a
lotion<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.720> protect<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.350> than<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.009> mist

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
lotion will protect you more than a mist

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
lotion will protect you more than a mist
but<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> good<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
but this is good if you're just kind of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
but this is good if you're just kind of
out<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> about<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> Sun<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> use<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
out and about in the Sun I like to use a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
out and about in the Sun I like to use a
separate<00:01:51.360> SPF<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:51.960> face<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
separate SPF on my face just because I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.289 
separate SPF on my face just because I
think<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> skin<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.369> your<00:01:53.460> face<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.909> slightly

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
think the skin on your face is slightly

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.580 
think the skin on your face is slightly
different<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:54.960> body<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.350> bit<00:01:55.470> more

different to your body it's bit more

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.139 
different to your body it's bit more
sensitive<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> might<00:01:56.729> break<00:01:56.909> out

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
sensitive I think you might break out

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
sensitive I think you might break out
easier<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.170> sort<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> heavier

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
easier if you use this sort of heavier

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
important as well it's something I think

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.370 
important as well it's something I think
most<00:02:26.730> people<00:02:27.060> forget<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.690> I've<00:02:27.810> burnt<00:02:28.230> my

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
lips once and it was really painful it's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.190 
lips once and it was really painful it's
very<00:02:30.840> different<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:32.160> thin<00:02:32.940> sensitive<00:02:33.600> skin<00:02:34.050> on

very different a thin sensitive skin on
your<00:02:34.320> lips<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.710> it's<00:02:34.800> important<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.760> protect

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
