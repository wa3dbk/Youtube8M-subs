touch-and-go Olympic weightlifting or

even 1 or M Olympic weightlifting what

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.870 
even 1 or M Olympic weightlifting what
it<00:00:16.680> does<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.070> protects<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.490> thumb<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it does is it protects your thumb and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.750 
it does is it protects your thumb and
the<00:00:17.940> hook<00:00:18.090> grip<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.230> found<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.740> go<00:00:20.279> tape<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the hook grip and I found the go tape to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
the hook grip and I found the go tape to
be<00:00:20.910> definitely<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> most<00:00:21.810> effective<00:00:22.260> tape

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
be definitely the most effective tape

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.599 
be definitely the most effective tape
for<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.619> because<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> doesn't<00:00:23.100> slide<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
for this because it doesn't slide off of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
for this because it doesn't slide off of
my<00:00:23.850> phones<00:00:24.380> when<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.529> wrapping<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.920> make

my phones when you're wrapping it make

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.439 
my phones when you're wrapping it make

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
sure that you wrap it so that you can

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.480 
sure that you wrap it so that you can
still<00:00:27.689> bend<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:28.050> thumb<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.560> know<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> lot<00:00:29.460> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
measuring it out you want it to be at

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
measuring it out you want it to be at
least<00:01:15.960> double<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> length<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.070> palm
