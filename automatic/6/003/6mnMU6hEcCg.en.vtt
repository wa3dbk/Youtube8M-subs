00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 basic in which I know and I would know 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.449
 anyone basically because I do not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.729
 I have no idea about this but I know the basics 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.010
 and I will try to help you 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.960
 all the people who do not pay for the subject and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.149
 so you can play online again with the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.699
 ps3 pirated so well let's go to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.499
 start with the tutorial well all 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.999
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.769
 download the three files that you 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.810
 I will leave in the description you will have to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.890
 download them and well then when 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.659
 you have me here in three 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.420
 different folders the first one to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.400
 install will be the 355 has 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.040
 in this name and this format very 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.490
 important and we'll hit it in a usb in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.290
 fat32 format is very important and what 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.899
 will do is create a folder within the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 usb to be called ps3 inside that 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.280
 folder we will have to create another one that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 call update is worth all this in 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.830
 capital letters and here inside we will have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 that put the update 355 I have 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.280
 now the previous one because it's from the video 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.530
 what I've done before, it's good that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.039
 done before and then we put 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.020
 directly update 355 when 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.420
 let's have this and if you want, take away the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.940
 pen and you put it in your console ps3 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.470
 pirated when we are in the console 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.240
 we'll have to get good as it has 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.979
 said the pen and when it is inside then 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 what we will have to do is give the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.429
 upgrade option of the system 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 And here we choose the second option will 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.330
 We give update by support 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 storage is worth and we wait for 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.019
 upload this update with this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.880
 version that is the one that has found in 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.400
 the usb that we have gotten and we hope 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.870
 we wait for this bar and the next one 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.459
 you will see I will put it a little on camera 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.780
 quick so this does not last long 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.940
 time and it goes like this 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.310
 wait ok but as you are watching 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.550
 then the console will be rebooted we go back to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.770
 enter now we are in the 355 as 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.110
 you will see here I show you and basically 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.030
 Well now we will do the next step 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.489
 we go to the computer I have the usb of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.850
 new and we will have to go to the folder of 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.470
 the 446 between book and then you will see that 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.420
 has another name different from this 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.040
 you will have to copy it like the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.630
 previous voucher has to be this name 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.970
 possibly have a few words or something 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.650
 at first because that erases JCE has 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.440
 have this same name and in 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.050
 capital letters and then we delete the 355 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.140
 of the usb like gotten from before and we put 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.750
 the 446 we hope it charges and already 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.220
 we can get the usb now what 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.380
 we will have to do is put it back 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.690
 in ps3 and we go again to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.580
 system update we go to the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.700
 second option again and again 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.920
 we update the 446 is worth when 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.350
 we update pÃ©rez that starts again 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.700
 this to load is worth the ams always to the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.610
 you do not have to touch anything else 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.860
 we wait for the two bars are in green 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.380
 the console will reboot several times 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.770
 also and well then we will have the 4 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.230
 46 between you now only two things are missing 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.800
 very simple we enter again in the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.920
 ps3 you see that we are in 446 and 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.380
 now the third part that remains would be 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.030
 download the spu voucher as you can see it is 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.130
 a toll is simply worth what 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.190
 we will have to do is come to the root 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.650
 of the usb or without navas entering the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.960
 first folder to the usb because that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.720
 folder the one that do not have anything then here 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.480
 We will put the pkg that I put this 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.340
 ok we'll put it here in the root as 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.290
 I'm saying everything else that I have 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.670
 here comes saved you do not have to have it 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.680
 all this because I had it from before 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.380
 simply that putting in that is already 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.460
 now we put the usb psso in the ps3 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.830
 ok let's go to the option of pacajes files 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.750
 be good here yerbales weeks and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.000
 here what we have to do is 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.160
 come to the second option and here then 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.140
 we will have to take the third option in 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.750
 the last one and here we will find 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.540
 well the pkg that we have gotten as 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.700
 I had enough because you simply look for 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.320
 the one that you have put that I in 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.480
 my case it is this which 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.800
 It will also be the same and when 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.690
 install it, we give it to the one who 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.700
 we install we will download this 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.680
 program we open we give it to the X 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.720
 how much is this if we do not give it to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.730
 if then we will get a little bit 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.650
 console we hope and now and simply 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.210
 tells us that we have to restart it 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.090
 we give the circle and it restarts 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.430
 automatically when you go back to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.870
 turn on the console so now 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.360
 we simply go back to the same folder 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.640
 of placaje manager we go to the second 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.560
 option and now let's go to the first voucher 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.500
 the hard disk and here we will have 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.940
 than installing the pkg that already comes with the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.610
 system is worth this already comes with the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.350
 update 446 now we are 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.110
 download this program under the whole 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.230
 we'll see the slipstream toolbox this one 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.510
 we open and in the second option we believe 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.590
 that there will be we go to the second option and 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.960
 where there are mods, we put it 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.840
 instead of normal we will put it in re book 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.490
 we give ok ok to the X and you already 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.620
 reboots us we will have our 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:36.050
 console with the 446 system and also the 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.090
 we will have with the ex puff 460 you know that 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.310
 when I give information to the system 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.830
 you will see the 460 but in reality we are 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.710
 in 4 46 and what we do is cheat 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.570
 the console and so we can play online 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.370
 it is worth now you will see that the hitan charged 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.950
 manager and everything does not need to change 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.960
 nothing or everything is as before as 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.790
 you have it before, everything is possibly 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.210
 the capi I have not tried it but everything 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.520
 others the pc3 appointment and the multi man and everything 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.860
 works the same, you will see that I open it 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.260
 charge to the air and everything works 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.120
 perfectly and we simply start 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.550
 session and you will see that anime loads the 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.890
 session and we are with a pirated ps3 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.170
 again everything perfect ready to be able 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.510
 play online again as soon as it comes out 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.490
 I will return to teach you the 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.410
 new tutorial so that we move to the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.300
 next update because this is 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.560
 something old and I guess it's not going to 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.140
 like it but good is what there is of 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.520
 moment and there are different methods but 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.349
 this is the basic what 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.030
