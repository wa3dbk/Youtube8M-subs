00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
the observation deck there was the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.670 
the observation deck there was the
pressure<00:02:40.489> plate<00:02:40.730> as<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:41.319> then<00:02:42.319> over

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
pressure plate as you can see then over

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.420 
pressure plate as you can see then over
here<00:02:43.300> replace<00:02:44.300> button<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.900> door

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
here replace button like so and a door

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.729 
here replace button like so and a door
over<00:02:49.430> here<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.079> fell<00:02:51.200> out<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.380> doors<00:02:51.590> at

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
over here and it fell out the doors at

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.940 
over here and it fell out the doors at
pressure<00:02:51.980> plate<00:02:52.510> then<00:02:53.510> we<00:02:53.750> get<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.200> golden

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
pressure plate then we get a golden

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.420 
pressure plate then we get a golden
pleasure<00:02:55.370> pressure<00:02:56.120> plate<00:02:57.190> which<00:02:58.190> we<00:02:58.370> are

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
pleasure pressure plate which we are

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.190 
pleasure pressure plate which we are
placing<00:02:58.670> over<00:02:59.120> here<00:02:59.299> so<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> second<00:03:00.019> block

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
placing over here so the second block

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.310 
placing over here so the second block
from<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.950> wall<00:03:01.130> oh<00:03:02.230> I'm<00:03:03.230> not<00:03:03.590> either<00:03:03.769> frame

painting is what we have to place next
to<00:03:08.329> then<00:03:08.510> it's<00:03:08.630> like<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.989> think<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.320> a

to then it's like I think it's a
computer<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.010> golden<00:03:10.280> one<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.390> need<00:03:11.540> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
computer and golden one and we need to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.470 
computer and golden one and we need to
exact<00:03:11.989> same<00:03:12.200> painting<00:03:12.620> us<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:13.910> are<00:03:13.940> over

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
okay so that's the painting next there's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.210 
okay so that's the painting next there's
a<00:03:24.950> lever<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.739> two<00:03:27.739> blocks<00:03:28.070> further<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.850> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
a lever and two blocks further is a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.120 
a lever and two blocks further is a
redstone<00:03:31.220> torch<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:33.859> how<00:03:34.010> it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
redstone torch like so so this is how it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.530 
redstone torch like so so this is how it
looks<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.549> observation<00:03:35.180> deck<00:03:35.380> with

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
looks the observation deck with

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.020 
looks the observation deck with
coming<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> little<00:03:36.900> bit<00:03:37.079> dark<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.829> think<00:03:38.069> that's

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
coming a little bit dark I think that's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.679 
coming a little bit dark I think that's
better<00:03:39.209> okay<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.439> we<00:03:41.069> are<00:03:41.159> now<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.400> back<00:03:42.329> to

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
better okay so we are now going back to

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:48.740 
better okay so we are now going back to
the<00:03:43.400> main<00:03:44.400> area<00:03:45.680> over<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:47.269> we<00:03:48.269> go<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.480> place

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the main area over here we go to place

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.899 
the main area over here we go to place
two<00:03:49.260> redstone<00:03:49.530> torches<00:03:50.010> next<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.549> door

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
two redstone torches next to the door

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.240 
two redstone torches next to the door
entry<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:52.469> course<00:03:52.680> we<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:52.980> place<00:03:53.220> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
entry and of course we have to place it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.990 
entry and of course we have to place it
or<00:03:53.489> itself

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
or itself

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.199 
or itself
then<00:03:54.689> between<00:03:55.019> those<00:03:55.409> redstone<00:03:55.890> torches<00:03:56.280> is

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
then between those redstone torches is

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.479 
then between those redstone torches is
going<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.540> be<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.689> sign<00:03:58.079> saying<00:04:01.189> what<00:04:02.189> is<00:04:02.340> it

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
going to be a sign saying what is it

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.240 
going to be a sign saying what is it
saying<00:04:02.760> oh<00:04:03.409> by<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.439> way<00:04:04.530> everything<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.099> in

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
saying oh by the way everything is in

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.149 
saying oh by the way everything is in
catalogs<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.819> say

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
catalogs you say

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.520 
catalogs you say
testing<00:04:08.720> chamber<00:04:09.720> like<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:13.200> course

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
testing chamber like that and of course

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.150 
testing chamber like that and of course
we<00:04:13.709> cannot<00:04:14.069> get<00:04:14.280> inside<00:04:14.700> without<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:16.160> stone

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
we cannot get inside without a stone

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.420 
we cannot get inside without a stone
pressure<00:04:17.900> no<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.530> thought<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.919> was<00:04:20.039> gonna<00:04:20.220> say

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
pressure no you thought it was gonna say

that's not cool force so there we go

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.960 
that's not cool force so there we go
that's<00:05:04.320> my<00:05:04.500> new<00:05:04.680> friend<00:05:05.039> over<00:05:05.460> there<00:05:05.639> how<00:05:05.909> i

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
that okay so let's continue by going

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.649 
that okay so let's continue by going
this<00:05:14.940> way<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:16.669> think<00:05:17.669> it's<00:05:18.000> actually<00:05:18.180> already

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
this way I think it's actually already

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:25.250 
this way I think it's actually already
almost<00:05:18.900> done<00:05:20.659> all<00:05:21.659> we<00:05:21.870> need<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.229> place<00:05:23.539> a<00:05:24.539> sign

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
almost done all we need to place a sign

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.290 
almost done all we need to place a sign
which<00:05:26.220> is<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.460> entry<00:05:26.729> sign<00:05:26.970> saying<00:05:27.889> doctor

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
which is the entry sign saying doctor

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.040 
which is the entry sign saying doctor
try<00:05:30.300> horas<00:05:31.430> like<00:05:32.430> so

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
try horas like so

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.890 
try horas like so
but<00:05:34.530> with<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:34.920> comma<00:05:36.290> lap<00:05:38.210> that's<00:05:39.210> what<00:05:39.540> it<00:05:39.630> says

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
but with a comma lap that's what it says

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.530 
but with a comma lap that's what it says
and<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:41.130> honestly<00:05:41.400> think<00:05:41.730> this<00:05:42.150> is<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.420> end

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
and I honestly think this is the end

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.990 
and I honestly think this is the end
already

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
already

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.060 
already
