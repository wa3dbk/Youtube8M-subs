00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.300
 Looking at a flat is very 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.070

 could you still afford that ? 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.119
 You could afford that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.090
 I in no case is the central park 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.250
 and look at it it was one 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.360
 German painter could explain well 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.980
 why that costs as much as it costs 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 I am now here at the central 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.739

 low-price segment to look at and times 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 Maybe I can look a bit 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.250
 I want this appartement here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 180 square meters the price of the apartment 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:20.189
 will be around and at 10 million 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:24.200
 only ten million dollars expensive 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.200
 is and matter of taste and doubt sow 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.939
 everything I'm with her ever 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.259
 I want to change a little bit what I want 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.659

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.579

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 billy shelves sets up that's all 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.159
 Here the terrain most of his team 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.619
 with long absolutely a chance in new york 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.189
 with security still comes to which 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:57.570
 segments if you give me that now 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:59.369
 Turn around for ten million dollars 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.490
 somehow still something discount in it moderately 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.290
 or something so stupid if I now one 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 Show some pictures and say here me 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.180
 I know the one and then I will 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.840
 cheaper 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:18.690
 No here, for example , not okay 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.819
 but now that very popular because of her 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.920
 Maybe we could have that maria okay 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.000
 then maybe I would even times 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.400
 50 cent to guest has already better me 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.080
 have it better than the country more expensive 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.780
 it will come in doubt then we in 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.510
 the higher prices rainha there can be 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.640
 also downgrade again I look 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.140
 know the wendler 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.730

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:50.500
 Germany 2011 2012 square meters, the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.990
 Eleven I did not have one at the entrance 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.390
 counting 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:06.340
 ok I can see right down wars 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:07.710
 I do not hear the price or so here 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.770
 that's good 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.990
 Miele is one of the shorts mostly 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.820
 Some of the kitchen appliances are Miele and 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:30.220
 also the washing machines are mostly 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:39.310
 Ranks with both the quality or is 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:40.930
 All this or we have initiated into 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.790
 master bedroom ends 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.220
 the master weltruf you know the beds 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.090
 No, no no, so I would 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.090
 make it short 8 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.590
 beautiful one times briefly lie down so 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.910
 normal that sometimes feels like 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:10.150
 That would be if I were here with them 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:13.450
 a goal so no big in the bedroom 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.260
 maybe this will be there for us 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.160
 other things done model not talk 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:27.400
 I would have been 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:31.560
 that was a fit ok 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:37.120
 they are relatively big that fit people 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.040
 You would also go for a walk in the park 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.430
 Can not meet because you can meet 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.020

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.840
