 Tell me, my name is Matheus, welcome. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.619
 on that day is another video but the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.060
 trailer that hope and I could not 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.350
 miss the opportunity to talk about 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 Internet 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.960
 I still watch because I got on the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.700
 school I started recording the next video 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.059
 which will be released next Thursday 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.100
 Then I remembered the trailer and I came to see the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:49.100
 trailer with you guys are going to workout 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:51.329
 appear on the screen but player gives the people 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.219
 you have to have watched the trailer 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.469
 will understand 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.969
 You will not see anything from the trailer because 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.969
 I'll be earphone 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.160
 who am i 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:51.070
 I will not say it's not just 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 our box in shock 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 Wow 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.460
 dra 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.930
 we have people of trembling it was kind of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.660
 more serious because it is to surprise 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.970
 fans get a trailer with lots of 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.760
 information with the first workout the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.160
 people even because it was a joke 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.910
 Last year just waiting had to 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:56.180
 hope part one just came from the leaves 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.180
 can today and tomorrow we do not always 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.549
 boot and then they surprised all the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.360
 put up because there were people was 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:13.200
 discouraged because we hope there 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.750
 very much accepted because never 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.420
 last year's trailer arrived and this 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.900
 stretch was too much account too much 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.730
 so gold ours in scenes that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.769
 urgently needed the book weighed people 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.609
 There's a movie of that very soon in the 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:36.530
 start we see the wedding of the end of the 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.530
 Sin celebration by people 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:52.140
 I already have eleven there to do well with it 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:59.189
 came but it's that thing and it has a band 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.409
 close even downloading so I do not know 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.730
 like a lot of people behind her with 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:09.569
 arrow counting play or whatever 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:17.609
 I understood very well that scene of the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:21.299
 end of the book whom I know but I think 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.720
 that probably some different scene 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.810
 from the book 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.479
 From there it was a crash when it 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.479
 destruction in the capital timbu way 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:53.810
 the book also in the capital 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.340
 I do not know 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.900
 that I do not know then I know what they are 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.310
 Speaking 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.710
 but the starter went out I reject 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.630
 wanted to send me a card here speaking 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.970
 on the friars even because he usually 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.440
 A lot of people already think about the radio, I do not 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.950
 milk a lot of people should already have 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.660
 read and should have read the book then 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.610
 I do not need to say a lot to whoever 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.670
 it was the surprise 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.190
 Did you like the video left there and did not 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.190
