00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.460 
it's really be asked whenever you burn
one<00:02:33.549> because<00:02:34.120> then<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:34.450> lose<00:02:34.659> it<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.110> sell<00:02:35.319> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
one because then you lose it to sell it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.229 
one because then you lose it to sell it
back<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.319> use<00:02:38.620> monkfish<00:02:39.099> instead<00:02:39.579> at<00:02:39.790> 89

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
back so you use monkfish instead at 89

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.610 
back so you use monkfish instead at 89
you're<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.629> just<00:02:40.900> cook<00:02:41.109> monkfish

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you're going to just cook monkfish

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.099 
you're going to just cook monkfish
straight<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.609> ninety<00:02:42.939> nine<00:02:43.090> ten<00:02:43.450> levels<00:02:43.629> of

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
straight to ninety nine ten levels of

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.399 
straight to ninety nine ten levels of
that<00:02:44.439> and<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.129> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.489> be<00:02:45.549> hard<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.409> it's

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
that and it is going to be hard and it's

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.250 
that and it is going to be hard and it's
going<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> cost<00:02:48.450> I'm<00:02:49.450> going<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.659> go<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:49.810> five
