how to do that and third you want to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.029 
how to do that and third you want to
take<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:46.800> blue<00:00:46.980> masking<00:00:47.340> tape<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.890> place<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
take some blue masking tape and place it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:01.569 
take some blue masking tape and place it
around<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.460> black<00:00:50.730> plug<00:00:51.649> like<00:00:52.649> so

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.030 

so<00:01:02.270> it's<00:01:02.390> completely<00:01:02.629> around<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.110> plug<00:01:03.350> so

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
so it's completely around the plug so

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.390 
so it's completely around the plug so
and<00:01:04.309> what<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:06.280> as<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.340> final<00:01:07.729> result<00:01:07.940> is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
and what you have as a final result is

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.620 
and what you have as a final result is
fixture<00:01:10.400> completely<00:01:10.760> covered<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.479> don't

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
fixture completely covered so you don't

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.240 
fixture completely covered so you don't
scratch<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:13.250> remove<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.700> end<00:01:13.850> plates<00:01:15.250> set

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
scratch it you remove the end plates set

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:33.910 
scratch it you remove the end plates set
them<00:01:16.400> aside<00:01:23.979> fan<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:29.180> take<00:01:29.479> your<00:01:29.630> pliers<00:01:32.920> get

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
them aside fan and take your pliers get

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.460 
them aside fan and take your pliers get
a<00:01:33.950> good<00:01:34.250> grip<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.820> plug<00:01:36.610> squeeze<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
a good grip on the plug squeeze it and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.639 
a good grip on the plug squeeze it and
slowly<00:01:39.950> maneuver<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.700> out<00:01:44.410> next<00:01:45.410> what<00:01:45.560> you

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
slowly maneuver it out next what you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.040 
slowly maneuver it out next what you
want<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.860> do<00:01:46.899> is<00:01:47.899> remove<00:01:48.289> this<00:01:48.470> black<00:01:48.710> piece

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:19.350 

and<00:01:54.050> just<00:01:54.830> slide<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.399> cover<00:02:16.480> there<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.569> go

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and just slide the cover there you go

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.870 
and just slide the cover there you go
next<00:02:20.360> step<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:21.680> locate<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.459> ballast<00:02:22.849> that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
next step just locate the ballast that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.530 
next step just locate the ballast that
is<00:02:23.650> not<00:02:24.650> operating<00:02:25.250> correctly<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
is not operating correctly and you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.240 
is not operating correctly and you
should<00:02:26.720> know<00:02:26.840> which<00:02:26.989> one<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.319> by<00:02:27.800> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
should know which one it is by a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.740 
should know which one it is by a
previous<00:02:29.120> video<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.790> mark<00:02:32.680> wish<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.569> bulbs<00:02:35.569> do

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
previous video you mark wish to bulbs do

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.990 
previous video you mark wish to bulbs do
not<00:02:35.900> fire<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:39.430> these<00:02:40.430> two<00:02:40.670> or<00:02:40.790> mark<00:02:41.500> these<00:02:42.500> two

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
not fire so these two or mark these two

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.369 
not fire so these two or mark these two
that<00:02:44.000> would<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.209> these<00:02:44.360> two<00:02:44.450> follow<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.170> wires

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
that would be these two follow the wires

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.070 
that would be these two follow the wires
to<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.800> ballast<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:47.390> ballast<00:02:47.720> right<00:02:47.900> here

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
to the ballast this ballast right here

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.100 
to the ballast this ballast right here
so<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.370> next<00:02:49.580> step<00:02:49.819> take<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:50.959> replacement

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
so the next step take your replacement

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.760 
so the next step take your replacement
ballast<00:02:51.770> set<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.220> right<00:02:52.489> next<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.940> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
ballast set it right next to it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.920 
ballast set it right next to it
grab<00:02:54.770> your<00:02:54.980> small<00:02:55.250> flat-head<00:02:55.610> screwdriver

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
grab your small flat-head screwdriver

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.910 
grab your small flat-head screwdriver
and<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:57.950> by<00:02:58.099> one<00:03:00.099> remove<00:03:01.099> a<00:03:01.190> wire<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.860> saw<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
and one by one remove a wire and saw the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.800 
and one by one remove a wire and saw the
wire<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.849> same<00:03:05.060> spot<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.720> new<00:03:06.140> ballast

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
wire in the same spot on the new ballast

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.840 
wire in the same spot on the new ballast
go<00:03:08.810> step<00:03:09.170> by<00:03:09.319> step<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.290> do<00:03:12.290> not<00:03:12.470> wire<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
go step by step so you do not wire the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.980 
go step by step so you do not wire the
new<00:03:14.030> ballast<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.600> correct

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
new ballast in correct

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:24.760 
new ballast in correct
and<00:03:15.790> possibly<00:03:16.790> cause<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.270> to<00:03:17.810> fry<00:03:18.020> itself<00:03:23.770> if

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
and possibly cause it to fry itself if

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.230 
and possibly cause it to fry itself if
you<00:03:24.830> ever<00:03:25.040> get<00:03:25.250> confused<00:03:26.140> or<00:03:27.140> lost<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:29.090> have

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
you ever get confused or lost you have

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.700 
you ever get confused or lost you have
that<00:03:29.420> second<00:03:29.810> ballot<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.260> can<00:03:30.410> look<00:03:30.530> and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
that second ballot so you can look and

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.140 
that second ballot so you can look and
see<00:03:30.830> how<00:03:30.950> its<00:03:31.130> wired<00:03:31.250> there's<00:03:31.550> also<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.850> wiring

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
see how its wired there's also a wiring

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.190 
see how its wired there's also a wiring
diagram<00:03:32.660> on<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.050> ballast<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.840> for<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.080> most
