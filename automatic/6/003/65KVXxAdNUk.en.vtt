here<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.770> will<00:00:54.770> make<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.640> easier<00:00:56.210> for<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.570> to

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
here that will make it easier for you to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.860 
here that will make it easier for you to
see<00:00:56.930> how<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.440> weave<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:58.190> invisibly<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.149> course

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
see how to weave in invisibly of course

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.840 
see how to weave in invisibly of course
if<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:00.260> were<00:01:00.379> weaving<00:01:00.649> in<00:01:00.920> your<00:01:01.100> ends<00:01:01.489> you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
if you were weaving in your ends you

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.570 
if you were weaving in your ends you
would<00:01:02.000> be<00:01:02.180> weaving<00:01:02.420> in<00:01:02.840> with<00:01:03.379> your<00:01:03.920> tail<00:01:04.250> which

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
would be weaving in with your tail which

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.040 
would be weaving in with your tail which
would<00:01:04.789> be<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.089> same<00:01:05.239> color<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.690> yarn<00:01:05.960> which

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
would be the same color of yarn which

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.200 
would be the same color of yarn which
would<00:01:06.410> make<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.710> more<00:01:06.890> invisible<00:01:07.460> but<00:01:08.000> just

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
would make it more invisible but just

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.029 
would make it more invisible but just
for<00:01:08.360> demonstration<00:01:08.390> I'm<00:01:09.200> going<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.500> use<00:01:09.590> a

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
for demonstration I'm going to use a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.400 
for demonstration I'm going to use a
contrasting<00:01:10.700> red<00:01:11.149> thread<00:01:11.539> so<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:12.200> follow

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
contrasting red thread so you can follow

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.430 
contrasting red thread so you can follow
along<00:01:13.000> now<00:01:14.000> be<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.539> midstream<00:01:15.080> of<00:01:15.320> your

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.410 
along now be it midstream of your
project<00:01:15.890> or<00:01:16.009> at<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.250> end<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.729> would<00:01:16.880> thread

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
project or at the end you would thread

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.249 
project or at the end you would thread
your<00:01:17.840> tail<00:01:18.319> onto<00:01:18.679> a<00:01:18.890> tapestry<00:01:19.340> needle<00:01:19.910> and

your tail onto a tapestry needle and

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.809 
your tail onto a tapestry needle and
then<00:01:21.259> follow<00:01:22.270> along<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.780> piece<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.500> yarn<00:01:24.860> just

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
then follow along a piece of yarn just

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.940 
then follow along a piece of yarn just
choose<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.599> thread<00:01:26.869> closest<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.530> your<00:01:27.619> tail

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
choose the thread closest to your tail

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.240 
choose the thread closest to your tail
and<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:29.060> are<00:01:29.179> going<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.479> follow<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.770> piece

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
and you are going to follow that piece

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.210 
and you are going to follow that piece
of<00:01:31.610> yarn<00:01:32.149> as<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.690> how<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.229> travels<00:01:33.590> through

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
of yarn as it how it travels through

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.779 
of yarn as it how it travels through
your<00:01:34.250> knitting<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:36.229> we'll<00:01:36.560> follow<00:01:36.950> this<00:01:37.369> piece

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
your knitting so we'll follow this piece

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.940 
your knitting so we'll follow this piece
of<00:01:38.030> yarn<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.599> we're<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:38.989> basically<00:01:39.259> lay

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
of yarn and we're going to basically lay

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.540 
of yarn and we're going to basically lay
our<00:01:40.310> tail<00:01:40.819> on<00:01:41.739> top<00:01:42.739> of<00:01:43.069> the<00:01:44.050> yarn<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:46.009> hide<00:01:46.340> it

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
our tail on top of the yarn to hide it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.699 
our tail on top of the yarn to hide it
on<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.789> back<00:01:46.970> side<00:01:47.239> so<00:01:47.599> this<00:01:48.080> piece<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.530> yarn

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
on the back side so this piece of yarn

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.190 
on the back side so this piece of yarn
travels<00:01:49.369> under<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:49.789> loop<00:01:50.209> and<00:01:50.479> then<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.020> can

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
travels under this loop and then you can

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.800 
travels under this loop and then you can
see<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:52.069> falls<00:01:52.520> along<00:01:52.759> this<00:01:53.060> way<00:01:53.300> under<00:01:53.599> that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
see it falls along this way under that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.180 
see it falls along this way under that
loop<00:01:54.080> I'm<00:01:54.890> going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.130> go<00:01:55.220> ahead<00:01:55.459> and<00:01:55.640> draw<00:01:56.030> that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
loop I'm going to go ahead and draw that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.779 
loop I'm going to go ahead and draw that
tail<00:01:58.190> through<00:01:59.470> mine<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.800> course<00:02:01.069> has<00:02:01.310> an<00:02:01.459> end

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
tail through mine of course has an end

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.550 
tail through mine of course has an end
but<00:02:02.090> that's<00:02:02.239> because<00:02:02.569> it's<00:02:02.959> not<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.379> real

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
but that's because it's not the real

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.119 
but that's because it's not the real
tail

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
tail

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.630 
tail
so<00:02:04.670> here<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.209> yarn<00:02:05.479> then<00:02:05.750> comes<00:02:06.050> out<00:02:06.640> from

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
so here the yarn then comes out from

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.699 
so here the yarn then comes out from
that<00:02:07.849> loop<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.300> around<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.929> way<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.560> will

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
that loop and around this way so I will

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.300 
that loop and around this way so I will
follow<00:02:10.190> with<00:02:10.700> my<00:02:11.510> thread<00:02:12.050> under<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:13.129> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
follow with my thread under here and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.520 
follow with my thread under here and
then<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.300> see<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:17.080> thread<00:02:18.080> or<00:02:18.470> yarn

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
then you can see that the thread or yarn

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.720 
then you can see that the thread or yarn
then<00:02:19.220> comes<00:02:19.610> back<00:02:19.730> into<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
then comes back into the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.899 
then comes back into the
Lube<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:21.629> started<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:23.090> draw<00:02:24.090> my<00:02:25.909> tail

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
Lube that we started with draw my tail

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.530 
Lube that we started with draw my tail
through<00:02:26.940> there<00:02:27.659> so<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.709> laying<00:02:29.519> my<00:02:30.090> tail

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
through there so I'm just laying my tail

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.660 
through there so I'm just laying my tail
on<00:02:30.840> top<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> yarn<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.860> following<00:02:32.370> along

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
on top of the yarn and following along

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.940 
on top of the yarn and following along
the<00:02:32.909> path<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.690> our<00:02:33.930> yarn<00:02:34.290> takes<00:02:34.620> when<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the path that our yarn takes when it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.360 
the path that our yarn takes when it
knits<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> under<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.379> loop<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.920> then<00:02:38.040> here

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
knits so under this loop and then here

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.000 
knits so under this loop and then here
it<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.819> can<00:02:38.970> see<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> needle<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:40.019> right

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
it is you can see the needle going right

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.789 
it is you can see the needle going right
on<00:02:41.250> top<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.080> stitch<00:02:43.080> or<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.349> piece<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
on top of the stitch or the piece of

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.789 
on top of the stitch or the piece of
yarn<00:02:44.129> that<00:02:44.459> we're<00:02:44.610> trying<00:02:44.879> to<00:02:45.030> follow<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.959> we

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
yarn that we're trying to follow and we

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.930 
yarn that we're trying to follow and we
just<00:02:47.069> get<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.430> nice<00:02:47.760> little<00:02:47.790> rhythm<00:02:48.390> going

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
just get this nice little rhythm going

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180 
just get this nice little rhythm going
so<00:02:50.940> now<00:02:51.180> here<00:02:51.510> my<00:02:51.659> yarn<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.769> I'm<00:02:52.950> following

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so now here my yarn and I'm following

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.339 
so now here my yarn and I'm following
comes<00:02:53.700> out<00:02:53.879> from<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.440> over<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.739> top<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.280> there

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
comes out from here over on top of there

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.130 
comes out from here over on top of there
to<00:02:58.349> follow<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.549> underneath<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.840> loop

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
to follow it here underneath that loop

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.990 
to follow it here underneath that loop
and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.459> comes<00:03:02.760> under<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:04.109> loop<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
and then it comes under this loop and it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.410 
and then it comes under this loop and it
comes<00:03:09.269> out<00:03:09.599> from<00:03:10.049> under<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:11.129> under<00:03:11.420> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
comes out from under here under that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.550 
comes out from under here under that
loop<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:14.180> under<00:03:15.180> here<00:03:15.629> you<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.379> get<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
loop this way under here you can get a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.610 
loop this way under here you can get a
little<00:03:16.829> quicker<00:03:17.069> if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.450> two<00:03:18.989> under

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
little quicker if you just do two under

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.410 
little quicker if you just do two under
two<00:03:19.920> loops<00:03:20.220> at<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> time<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.090> takes<00:03:24.239> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
two loops at a time and it takes a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.509 
two loops at a time and it takes a
little<00:03:24.510> bit<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.810> practice<00:03:25.440> until<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.160> can<00:03:26.370> get

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
little bit of practice until you can get

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.430 
little bit of practice until you can get
used<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:29.250> you'll<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.730> able<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.450> see<00:03:31.230> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
used to it but you'll be able to see the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.370 
used to it but you'll be able to see the
path<00:03:31.709> if<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> yarn<00:03:32.459> takes<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.380> follow

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
path if the yarn takes and just follow

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.949 
path if the yarn takes and just follow
it<00:03:34.650> along<00:03:37.340> coming<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.519> from<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.269> under<00:03:39.630> this

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
it along coming out from here under this

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.970 
it along coming out from here under this
loop<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:41.069> loop<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:43.290> don't<00:03:43.500> want<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.739> pull

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
loop that loop you don't want to pull

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.220 
loop that loop you don't want to pull
this<00:03:44.160> too<00:03:44.609> tight<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.239> want<00:03:45.419> it<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.690> mimic<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
this too tight you want it to mimic the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.059 
this too tight you want it to mimic the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
tension of your knitting coming out from

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.569 
tension of your knitting coming out from
here<00:03:50.430> here<00:03:51.389> comes<00:03:51.630> my<00:03:51.840> yarn<00:03:52.130> under<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:53.310> loop

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
here here comes my yarn under this loop

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.839 
here here comes my yarn under this loop
and<00:03:53.880> back<00:03:54.599> again<00:03:54.780> through<00:03:55.109> that<00:03:55.319> loop<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.010> I

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
and back again through that loop and I

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.210 
and back again through that loop and I
usually<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.389> weave<00:03:57.930> about<00:03:58.319> six<00:03:58.709> inches

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
usually like to weave about six inches

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.140 
usually like to weave about six inches
worth<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.660> my<00:04:00.660> tail<00:04:01.109> through<00:04:01.139> my<00:04:01.799> knitting<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
worth of my tail through my knitting the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.059 
worth of my tail through my knitting the
good<00:04:03.329> news<00:04:03.480> about<00:04:03.629> weaving<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.349> your<00:04:04.500> ends<00:04:04.950> as

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
good news about weaving in your ends as

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.599 
good news about weaving in your ends as
opposed<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.549> making<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:06.030> knot<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.980> should

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
opposed to making a knot is that should

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.869 
opposed to making a knot is that should
your<00:04:09.150> weaving<00:04:09.540> come<00:04:09.930> undone<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:11.370> just<00:04:11.609> weave

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
your weaving come undone you just weave

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.390 
your weaving come undone you just weave
it<00:04:12.030> right<00:04:12.180> back<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:12.660> which<00:04:13.019> almost<00:04:13.799> never

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
it right back in which almost never

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.890 
it right back in which almost never
happens<00:04:15.139> where<00:04:16.139> if<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.380> knot<00:04:16.620> comes<00:04:16.889> undone

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
happens where if a knot comes undone

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.659 
happens where if a knot comes undone
then<00:04:18.900> you're<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.709> left<00:04:19.949> with<00:04:20.099> this<00:04:20.400> tiny

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
then you're just left with this tiny

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.279 
then you're just left with this tiny
little<00:04:20.880> piece<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.239> thread<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.690> nothing<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.139> do

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
little piece of thread and nothing to do

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.070 
little piece of thread and nothing to do
with<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.699> so<00:04:23.699> I'm<00:04:24.240> going<00:04:24.449> to<00:04:24.539> make<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.840> my

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
with it so I'm going to make this my

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.690 
with it so I'm going to make this my
last<00:04:25.349> stitch<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.610> comes

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
last stitch it comes

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.040 
last stitch it comes
my<00:04:27.760> ear<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.180> then<00:04:28.270> I'm<00:04:28.360> following<00:04:28.810> comes

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
my ear and then I'm following comes

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.820 
my ear and then I'm following comes
under<00:04:29.290> here<00:04:30.060> back<00:04:31.060> under<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:32.020> loop<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.560> I've

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
under here back under that loop so I've

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.860 
under here back under that loop so I've
woven<00:04:36.100> in<00:04:36.340> about<00:04:36.550> six<00:04:36.880> inches<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.300> thread<00:04:37.570> and

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
woven in about six inches of thread and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.770 
woven in about six inches of thread and
of<00:04:38.080> course<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.680> not<00:04:39.040> as<00:04:39.190> pretty<00:04:39.400> as

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
of course this is not as pretty as

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.150 
of course this is not as pretty as
normal<00:04:40.780> tension<00:04:41.140> would<00:04:41.200> be<00:04:41.260> then<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:41.920> go<00:04:42.070> ahead

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
normal tension would be then I go ahead

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.770 
normal tension would be then I go ahead
and<00:04:42.250> give<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.670> little<00:04:42.820> stretch<00:04:43.270> just<00:04:43.570> to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
and give it a little stretch just to
