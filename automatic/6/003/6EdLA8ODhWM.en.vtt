and<00:01:03.070> then<00:01:03.250> we<00:01:03.340> flip<00:01:03.520> this<00:01:03.700> switch

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.770 

and<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.549> team<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.240> across<00:01:12.420> safely

it<00:01:21.300> looks<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.350> away

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.130 

but<00:01:25.620> they<00:01:25.800> left<00:01:26.160> us<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.880> present
