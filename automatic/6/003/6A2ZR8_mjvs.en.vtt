00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.550 

you<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.310> course<00:03:55.610> could<00:03:55.910> be<00:03:56.110> adding<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.230> colors

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
you of course could be adding the colors

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.370 
you of course could be adding the colors
as<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:57.860> go<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.880> live<00:03:59.180> paint<00:03:59.510> but<00:03:59.959> for<00:04:00.200> me

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
as you go with live paint but for me

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.729 
as you go with live paint but for me
it's<00:04:00.650> easier<00:04:01.069> for<00:04:01.099> me<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.550> come<00:04:01.760> up<00:04:01.910> with<00:04:02.209> a

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
it's easier for me to come up with a

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.589 
it's easier for me to come up with a
more<00:04:03.739> interesting<00:04:04.099> palette<00:04:04.670> if<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:05.390> lay

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
more interesting palette if I just lay

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.750 
more interesting palette if I just lay
down<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:06.080> flat<00:04:06.319> color<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.890> then<00:04:07.130> come<00:04:07.370> back<00:04:07.400> in

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:22.180 
down a flat color and then come back in
and<00:04:07.790> adjust<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.569> colors<00:04:08.900> later<00:04:20.799> oops<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.100> need

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
colors so to do this I'm going to go

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.770 
colors so to do this I'm going to go
over<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.910> my<00:04:52.970> layers<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:55.000> create<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.180> new<00:04:56.540> layer

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
over to my layers and create a new layer

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.070 
over to my layers and create a new layer
and<00:05:00.910> lock<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.940> few<00:05:02.210> layers<00:05:02.390> just<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.810> make<00:05:02.930> sure

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
and lock a few layers just to make sure

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.510

that<00:05:03.229> I'm<00:05:03.350> not<00:05:03.500> drawing<00:05:03.770> on<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.130> wrong<00:05:04.310> layer

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520
