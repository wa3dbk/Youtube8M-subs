00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.270
 and my beauty is seeing this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.400
 mess you 're doing here then 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 I'm trying to give a line in the reader 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.370
 of my cube game 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.920
 I'm risking this world. 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.699
 electronic well wins very sincere 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.100
 He needs a tough team. Let's see. 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.880
 here to take the test 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.230
 the camera focuses but also this bridge in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 black pot regulating laser 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.030
 people in the cannon are regular 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 blood to be able to do when the best 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.280
 In the games I was in the g4 is here and I think 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:46.250
 which is making this motive visible 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.250
 to give you an idea here O 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.399
 Look at how much unique resistance of 466 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 there we will leave it with 530 that was left 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 I recommend me to have this very carefully 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.739
 we will give a relaxadinha as 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.739
 find my daughter 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.119
 Look, I do not know if the camera focuses more 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:49.840
 out of 523 I'll try to arrive at 15 30 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:55.149
 right here mother is talking that I stopped for 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:02.110
 a certain distress now because the measure 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:04.840
 no you do not care how 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.009
 so here is little here that is O 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 thing like that 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.480
 there is very little that you move 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:35.859
 400 since light and or is so or just think 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.370
 that it is safe third experience that 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:44.470
 I'm having this world of electronics. 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.060
 and the two women did not go very well 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:53.769
 to tell the truth to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:59.769
 You here is one more thing to do. 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:02.410
 that right here I can get here and 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.530
 23 I'll let the 523 make a 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.599
 test but people watch this video here I 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.910
 I'm doing my own thing and risk not 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.220
 dare to do what you do not know 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.410
 do before you do if this 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.750
 procedure here I researched a lot in the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.350
 internet from multiple books to a friend 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.200
 of the channel q gambia 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.370
 River one game collections and was also made 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.110
 and I asked him there I tried here and 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.520
 on my own and at risk of spoiling this 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.680
 video game that I can not blame 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.230
 anyone but myself 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.920
 so let's not do things without 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.500
 to know 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.580
 I ask for help from someone who knows someone 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.690
 what a piece of cake 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:48.020
 I never had to try to leave them well. 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.790
 the movement and the danger you 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.790
 Can you see in unt 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:33.980
 even so the team did not get 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:36.110
 see but now I will confess to 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.170
 You guys, I had a hard time. 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.330
 now it is I had calibrated it on 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.680
 five hundred and thirty years to hear 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.630
 tutorials that saw the most 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.100
 unfortunately I started the game not 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.060
 recognize but you try to impute 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.530
 I messed up the video game and what happened? 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.280
 easy since I would try again 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.180
 I went there and only instead of increasing 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.410
 resistance decreases or decreases to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.360
 399 I do not know if you could see 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.510
 was at 400 of which 148 in 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.820
 530 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:14.150
 only there gave you this problem that you did not read 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:17.120
 to talk about reducing to 3 99 and worked out 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.710
 but people have an experience is passed 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.300
 a suffocation to achieve 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.560
 like I said do not recommend if you do not 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.590
 have equipment you do not have 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.870
 do not do it at home because 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.950
 It can be very bad, I tried to look at it. 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.200
 You need to be myself and he 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.840
 I'll try to show you 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.030
 He and I will not give it to you. 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.250
 came here but I go there and ride the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.130
 video game now that it's all just right 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.130
 One more test, I'm going to disconnect. 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.250
 Let's see if he's going to get in fast now. 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.770
 the media reading problems 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.160
 he stood on this screen did not enter 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.120
 and it looks just fine now the reader of the 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.620
 gamecube nÃ© 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.070
 but we are gaining experience 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.260
 It's of curiosity to you here is me. 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.090
 I had the curiosity made available to 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.520
 do the same physical as this does not 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.960
 I recommend that you do go out doing this 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.610
 Kind of thing, your house, I did it for mine. 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.590
 account and risk, or if I had 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.900
 lost video game could not for anyone 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.360
 except myself but will get 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.460
 Thankfully, it's working. 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.620
 It's of experience for me, too. 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.300
 Then of curiosity also that if you 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.450
 you have the right equipment and a bit of 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.550
 patience and a little more good movie 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.740
 I used to ride my caramba that moment that 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.570
 do the opposite but do the opposite 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.190
 take the professional that you know 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.050
 He'll do it for you. 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.330
 more leaving people is worth as experience 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.550
 for me my third experience 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.970
 third adventure in the world let's say 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.620
 videogames concerts is 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.570
 once again the game had to get 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.550
 aligning his cannon as he said is 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.900
 again I do not recommend that you do 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.190
 so if you do not have a bit of 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.830
 knowledge a little patience 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.140
 a little calm and again it's for your 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.890
 account and risk I made on my own 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.750
 then there is the warning again. 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.040
 It's not until I forget something. 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.350
 important that I did not tell you 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.750
 beginning of the video I made - uce videos that 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.450
 They will need a multimeter just looks 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.110
 you will use in the scale of 2,000 two 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:21.020
 a thousand men here 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:23.180
 in my case I had to reduce the 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.210
 the southpaw and there are people who 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.870
 increases but there goes from the test you go 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.370
 even doing so for well pequeninho 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.380
 they will need a key 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.410
 philips very small that will not be measured 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.630
 of this key here the other screws 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.930
 this other philips and to be able to open the 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.680
 console the infamous key game and that 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.630
 this here you 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.919
 an act the most scientific videogame of 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.470
 video curiosity I hope you guys 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.720
 have enjoyed anything like and until 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.729
 the next one would have again for his 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.199
 The film by conquest gave 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.199
 right and rejects
