00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
out i'm definitely gonna try my hardest

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.800 
out i'm definitely gonna try my hardest
to<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:49.710> him<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:51.630> main

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to make him you know one of my main

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.300 
to make him you know one of my main
characters<00:01:52.350> whether<00:01:52.649> i<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.280> not

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
characters whether i like them or not

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
characters whether i like them or not
you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.820> it'll<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.210> pretty<00:01:54.479> cool<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.780> he's<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you know it'll be pretty cool if he's a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.289 
you know it'll be pretty cool if he's a
little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.470> harder<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.280> or<00:01:56.700> there's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
little bit harder to use or there's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.060 
little bit harder to use or there's
always<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:57.990> variation<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> lot

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
always like one variation that's a lot

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
always like one variation that's a lot
easier<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.790> use<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> other<00:02:00.390> ones<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.780> I'm

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
easier to use in the other ones so I'm

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170 
easier to use in the other ones so I'm
hoping<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.820> hardest

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
hoping that the one that's the hardest

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.359 
hoping that the one that's the hardest
is<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.840> his<00:02:04.110> best<00:02:04.380> variation<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.189> did

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
is kind of his best variation if you did

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
is kind of his best variation if you did
you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.729> master<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.390> stuff<00:02:06.719> when<00:02:07.590> Tanya

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
you know master it and stuff when Tanya

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.619 
you know master it and stuff when Tanya

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
came out she was pretty hard to use and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.540
