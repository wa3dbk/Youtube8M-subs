00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.260
 the challenge today of a very video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.189
 special for me these blog sources 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.840
 mam'zelle six points like and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 today I'm going to talk to you about a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 mark gemey maybelline who launches a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 any new mascara that's called if they 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.330
 ring north sachot he seals his 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.890
 heat if you follow me on the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 different social networks you know 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 maybe I love this mascara I have 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 spoken on twitter I have also 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 spoken on my youtube channel this mascara 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 gives the illusion that you have a lot 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 more style that are multiplied from the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.530
 inner corner outer corner through a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
 brush that's pretty innovative is enough 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 unbelievable I have to say it's a 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.289
 brush that is curved to be able to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.739
 really marry the rounded shape of 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.539
 the eye 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 I love this kind of brushes I find 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.940
 that it defines a lot better but if it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.280
 can not use too much 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.809
 the brush in hair in general I 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.250
 prefers pico like that who me 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.440
 allow to separate well but if 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.570
 you already have a little and and boozing done 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.509
 fan to apply it there is a 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.680
 little gesture then you take your 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:18.009
 mascara the movement you take like that 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.220
 you shook well and you turn to the 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.290
 top 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.180
 I will put mascara at the base of 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.310
 eyelashes and I'm going to turn the mascara into 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.220
 stretching towards the world and then a 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.750
 I have to catch him but if he 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.440
 return the breaststroke I actually fall 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.560
 completely and I come up suddenly 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.330
 the rest of the eyelashes with piccolos 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.780
 cowboys labrosse is a little bit high 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.060
 tech 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.729
 you have to turn it in a certain direction 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.289
 for after having a mega volume so 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.149
 it's gone for three small layers 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.100
 mascara of course but not too 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.960
 more for it to make a legacy panda 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.229
 I put my sensational eyelash mascara 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.080
 and the strength is to see there is a 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.030
 length that I did not have then they 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.920
 unfold the eyelashes as a result 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 is good in any case I could note 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.239
 that the makeup removal was hyper easy is 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.429
 what I like most is that 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.230
 so already I have no packages at all 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.180
 and that's really important for me 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.400
 in a mascara I like eyelashes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.750
 bulky and long at your curves and but 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 it is important not that they have package 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 there is no attack 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.480
 two packages here is the result wow 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.550
 sexual and he is well black well 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.170
 pigmented it lasts a long time they have 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.030
 use a bit extensions it their 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.680
 gives thickness and we can also 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.200
 very well to remove makeup so I want 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.020
 to say it's perfect total validation 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.130

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.550

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.700
