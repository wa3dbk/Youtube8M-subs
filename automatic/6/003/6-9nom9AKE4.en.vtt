 explosion there we are after a few 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.120
 mint leaves 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.069
 to give freshness green color joy 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.000
 to the plate 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.540
 to remember Carmen 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.519

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.099
 the last mind to remember Carmen 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.219

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.590

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.569

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.189

 child seriously and in the end 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.910
 a little bit of crowbar recently 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.200
 I found out that the crowbar comes from a 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
 word that comes from Nahuatl that 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.970
 Mexico also means joy in them 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.440
 we call joy 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.420
 they are like a kind of made blocks 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.770
 of nuts the original peanut 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.920
 nowadays we can find everything 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.390
 it has amaranth and hazelnuts and what 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.940
 we do is regroup those two 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.790
 ingredients with something sticky like the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.430
 honey 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.829
 and what we are going to do is place some 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.329
 crowbars when traveling to Mexico in 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.909
 any corner in any position 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.840
 you are going to find people selling 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.519
 crowbars and once you probÃ©is 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.049
 You are going to vitiate, that is, you are going to do 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.049
 friends only so that they can 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.939
 mail by cuddles as 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.360
 only thing that remains is to try this 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.700
 greedy dessert 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.060

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.060
 I was doing 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.700
 and there we are 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.440

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.000
