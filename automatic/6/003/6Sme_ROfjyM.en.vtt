this<00:00:42.809> enables<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.829> driver<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> couple

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
this enables the driver to do a couple

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.400 
this enables the driver to do a couple
things<00:00:45.110> first

you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.129> basically<00:00:47.370> drive<00:00:48.239> any<00:00:48.570> speed<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you can basically drive any speed you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can basically drive any speed you
want<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.559> match<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> dot<00:00:53.180> six

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
want and match it up to the dot six

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.889 
want and match it up to the dot six
kilometers<00:00:54.570> per<00:00:54.750> hour<00:00:54.809> here

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.790 

obviously<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.480> do<00:01:16.600> any<00:01:16.870> number<00:01:17.170> in

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
obviously you can do any number in

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.220 
obviously you can do any number in
between<00:01:17.950> or<00:01:18.340> above<00:01:18.850> or<00:01:19.510> below

the vehicle as far as the speed goes in

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.610 
the vehicle as far as the speed goes in
situation<00:01:28.400> it's<00:01:28.610> like<00:01:29.230> peeking<00:01:30.230> around
