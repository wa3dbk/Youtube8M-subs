few<00:01:44.189> things<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> comes<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.180> lens<00:01:45.420> cloth

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
few things it comes with this lens cloth

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.440 
few things it comes with this lens cloth
which<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.040> honest<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.790> really

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
which to be honest with you I really

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
which to be honest with you I really
don't<00:01:48.750> even<00:01:48.899> recommend<00:01:49.290> using<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
don't even recommend using it because it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
don't even recommend using it because it
has<00:01:50.310> lots<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.000> fibers<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.320> those

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
has lots of fibers in it and those

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
has lots of fibers in it and those
fibers<00:01:52.770> tend<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.399> leave<00:01:53.579> lint<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.270> lenses

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
fibers tend to leave lint on your lenses

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.030 
fibers tend to leave lint on your lenses
so<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.960> even<00:01:55.079> use<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> want

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so I don't even use this but if you want

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
so I don't even use this but if you want
to<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.250> something<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.909> maybe<00:01:57.360> clean<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
to have something to maybe clean the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.959 
to have something to maybe clean the
body<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.500> your<00:01:58.740> camera<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.369> would<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.520> great

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
body of your camera that would be great

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.069 
body of your camera that would be great

the I've I like the bowl brush and this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.170 
the I've I like the bowl brush and this
is<00:02:04.290> generally<00:02:05.040> used<00:02:05.280> some<00:02:05.610> people<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.030> like

it has a little blower in it too and
what<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.020> used<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.890> remove<00:02:11.160> any

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
what this is used for is to remove any

what this is used for is to remove any
particles<00:02:11.520> on

the<00:02:13.499> lens<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.010> UV<00:02:14.370> cover<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.390> when<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.689> use

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
the lens or the UV cover so when you use

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.379 
the lens or the UV cover so when you use
your<00:02:16.140> lens<00:02:16.560> tissue<00:02:16.859> you're<00:02:17.159> not<00:02:17.310> rubbing<00:02:18.239> the

dirt or rubbing the lint into the into
the<00:02:20.760> lens<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.060> scratching<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:21.719> this<00:02:21.840> is

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the lens and scratching it so this is

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.059 
the lens and scratching it so this is
just<00:02:22.200> usually<00:02:22.590> used<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.549> remove<00:02:23.819> any<00:02:24.090> lint<00:02:24.450> or

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you know larger dust particles the lens

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.729 
you know larger dust particles the lens
tissue<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:30.109> special<00:02:31.109> tissue<00:02:31.319> that

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
tissue this is special tissue that

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.920 
tissue this is special tissue that
doesn't<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.389> fibers<00:02:33.389> that<00:02:33.510> are<00:02:33.569> gonna<00:02:33.689> come

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
doesn't have fibers that are gonna come

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.809 
doesn't have fibers that are gonna come
off<00:02:34.139> and<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.590> usually<00:02:34.799> really<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.579> clean

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819

off and it's usually really really clean
these<00:02:35.939> are<00:02:36.000> our<00:02:36.209> one-time<00:02:36.719> use<00:02:36.989> only<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.590> this

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
these are our one-time use only and this

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.309 
these are our one-time use only and this
is<00:02:37.889> what<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.069> prefer<00:02:38.340> because<00:02:39.239> if<00:02:40.109> you're

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
is what I prefer because if you're

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.860 
is what I prefer because if you're
cleaning<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.709> dirty<00:02:40.919> lens<00:02:41.599> it's<00:02:42.599> gonna<00:02:42.719> get

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
cleaning a dirty lens it's gonna get

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.479 
cleaning a dirty lens it's gonna get
dirty<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.319> know<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:44.159> don't<00:02:44.249> want<00:02:44.459> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
dirty you know and you don't want to

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.250 
dirty you know and you don't want to
transfer<00:02:44.969> this<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.359> your<00:02:45.510> next<00:02:45.689> lens<00:02:46.079> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
transfer this to your next lens that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.619 
transfer this to your next lens that
you're<00:02:46.379> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> clean<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.419> the<00:02:48.419> lens

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
you're going to clean so the lens

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.449 
you're going to clean so the lens
cleaning<00:02:49.019> solution<00:02:49.469> is<00:02:49.829> typically<00:02:50.340> either

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
cleaning solution is typically either

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.770 
cleaning solution is typically either
rubbing<00:02:50.849> alcohol<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.569> some<00:02:51.780> sort<00:02:52.079> of

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
rubbing alcohol or some sort of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.449 
rubbing alcohol or some sort of
isopropyl<00:02:54.780> alcohol<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.799> something<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.250> that

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
isopropyl alcohol or something like that

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.670 
isopropyl alcohol or something like that
and<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.449> reason<00:02:57.480> why<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.989> want<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.379> use<00:02:58.500> this

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and the reason why you want to use this

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.039 
and the reason why you want to use this
instead<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.129> water<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.909> because<00:03:00.629> this<00:03:00.900> is

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
instead of water is because this is

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.030 
instead of water is because this is
going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.500> evaporate<00:03:01.889> quickly<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:04.439> want

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
going to evaporate quickly and you want

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.909 
going to evaporate quickly and you want
to<00:03:05.459> put<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:05.969> cleaning<00:03:06.299> solution<00:03:06.780> onto<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
to put the cleaning solution onto the

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.089 
to put the cleaning solution onto the
cleaning<00:03:08.459> tissue<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:09.269> onto<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.169> lens<00:03:10.439> and

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
cleaning tissue not onto the lens and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.920 
cleaning tissue not onto the lens and
you<00:03:11.159> know<00:03:11.430> what<00:03:11.639> whatever<00:03:11.909> works<00:03:12.389> is<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
you know what whatever works is the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.289 
you know what whatever works is the
right<00:03:13.139> way<00:03:13.349> some<00:03:14.189> people<00:03:14.459> will<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.760> really

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
right way some people will be really

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.209 
right way some people will be really
particular<00:03:15.930> about<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.379> but<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:16.709> I'm<00:03:16.980> saying

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
particular about this but as I'm saying

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.429 
particular about this but as I'm saying
as<00:03:17.340> long<00:03:17.459> as<00:03:17.669> it's<00:03:17.819> clean<00:03:18.169> it's<00:03:19.169> probably

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
as long as it's clean it's probably

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.319 
as long as it's clean it's probably
gonna<00:03:19.560> be<00:03:19.709> okay<00:03:19.739> now<00:03:20.729> when<00:03:20.909> you're<00:03:21.030> cleaning

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
gonna be okay now when you're cleaning

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.929 
gonna be okay now when you're cleaning
the<00:03:21.659> lens<00:03:21.900> itself<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.829> have<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.370> really

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
the lens itself you do have to be really

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.179 
the lens itself you do have to be really
really<00:03:24.090> careful<00:03:24.449> if<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.259> some<00:03:25.290> reason<00:03:25.769> dirt

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
really careful if for some reason dirt

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.069 
really careful if for some reason dirt
gets<00:03:26.400> inside<00:03:26.759> and<00:03:27.060> actually<00:03:27.569> touches<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
gets inside and actually touches the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.580 
gets inside and actually touches the
lens<00:03:28.669> this<00:03:29.669> way<00:03:29.909> when<00:03:30.180> we<00:03:30.209> clean<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.290> UV

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
lens this way when we clean just the UV

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.619 
lens this way when we clean just the UV
filter<00:03:31.979> it's<00:03:32.189> it's<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:33.090> know<00:03:33.180> there's<00:03:33.329> less

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
filter it's it's you know there's less

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.390 
filter it's it's you know there's less
risk<00:03:33.989> because<00:03:34.199> if<00:03:34.319> we<00:03:34.439> mess<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.889> up<00:03:34.949> you're

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
risk because if we mess this up you're

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490 
risk because if we mess this up you're
talking<00:03:35.669> about<00:03:35.759> you<00:03:36.359> know<00:03:36.449> $20<00:03:36.959> filter<00:03:37.379> that

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
talking about you know $20 filter that

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.830 
talking about you know $20 filter that
you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:37.859> replace<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.419> this<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
you can just replace and so this is the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.339 
you can just replace and so this is the
circular<00:03:40.560> motion<00:03:40.879> method<00:03:41.879> some<00:03:42.120> people<00:03:42.419> won't

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
circular motion method some people won't

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.050 
circular motion method some people won't
even<00:03:43.470> go<00:03:43.769> over<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.979> same<00:03:44.280> area<00:03:44.310> twice<00:03:44.819> with

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
even go over the same area twice with

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.759 
even go over the same area twice with
the<00:03:45.090> lens<00:03:45.359> tissue<00:03:45.689> because<00:03:46.169> they're<00:03:46.590> just

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
the lens tissue because they're just

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.649 
the lens tissue because they're just
paranoid<00:03:47.489> about<00:03:47.669> scratching<00:03:48.000> their<00:03:48.299> filters

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
paranoid about scratching their filters

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.839 
paranoid about scratching their filters
but<00:03:49.290> if<00:03:49.379> it's<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.620> filter<00:03:49.979> you<00:03:50.669> can<00:03:50.790> use

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
but if it's a filter you can use

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.979 
but if it's a filter you can use
circular<00:03:51.180> motions<00:03:53.150> small<00:03:54.150> circles<00:03:54.569> all<00:03:54.720> over

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
circular motions small circles all over

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.149 
circular motions small circles all over
as<00:03:55.169> long<00:03:55.349> as<00:03:55.470> you're<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:55.979> same

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
as long as you're going in the same

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.379 
as long as you're going in the same
direction<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.639> don't<00:03:56.669> think<00:03:56.969> it's<00:03:57.060> going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.299> be

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
direction I don't think it's going to be

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.059 
direction I don't think it's going to be
a<00:03:57.419> problem

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
a problem

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.550 
a problem
an<00:03:59.069> easy<00:03:59.250> way<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.459> check<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.359> hold<00:04:00.629> it<00:04:00.840> up

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
an easy way to check it is to hold it up

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.469 
an easy way to check it is to hold it up
so<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:01.979> can<00:04:02.099> see<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> light<00:04:02.639> reflecting<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:03.359> it

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
so you can see a light reflecting in it

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.390 
so you can see a light reflecting in it
and<00:04:03.599> they<00:04:03.659> probably<00:04:04.229> can't<00:04:04.680> see<00:04:04.949> it<00:04:04.979> but<00:04:05.250> that

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
and they probably can't see it but that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.679 
and they probably can't see it but that
will<00:04:05.519> show<00:04:05.729> you<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:06.000> there's<00:04:06.150> any<00:04:06.299> dirt<00:04:06.569> or

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
will show you if there's any dirt or

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.689 
will show you if there's any dirt or
fingerprints<00:04:07.319> on<00:04:07.439> it<00:04:07.469> now<00:04:07.799> I'm<00:04:08.099> going<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.519> show

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
fingerprints on it now I'm going to show

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.759 
fingerprints on it now I'm going to show
you<00:04:08.790> guys<00:04:08.939> how<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.329> clean<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.169> lens<00:04:10.349> itself

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
you guys how to clean the lens itself

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.189 
you guys how to clean the lens itself
now<00:04:11.069> this<00:04:11.340> one<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.969> would<00:04:12.539> recommend<00:04:12.719> being

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
now this one I would recommend being

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.819 
now this one I would recommend being
extra<00:04:13.829> careful<00:04:14.280> because<00:04:14.459> if<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.269> mess<00:04:15.449> it<00:04:15.509> up

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
extra careful because if you mess it up

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.229 
extra careful because if you mess it up
that<00:04:16.829> is<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.310> glass<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.849> mean<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.090> can

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
that is the glass I mean you can

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.719 
that is the glass I mean you can
probably<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.560> know<00:04:19.680> fixed<00:04:20.370> repaired

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
probably have it you know fixed repaired

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.180 
probably have it you know fixed repaired
but<00:04:20.909> in<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.090> case<00:04:21.329> this<00:04:21.599> lens<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.229> perfectly

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
but in this case this lens is perfectly

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.740 
but in this case this lens is perfectly
clean<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:25.080> one<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.440> would<00:04:25.740> recommend<00:04:25.860> not

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
clean on this one I would recommend not

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.720 
clean on this one I would recommend not
going<00:04:27.230> over<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.530> same<00:04:27.920> part<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.520> lens

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
going over the same part of the lens

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.910 
going over the same part of the lens
twice<00:04:29.150> because<00:04:29.510> if<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.870> pick<00:04:30.080> up<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.440> speck<00:04:30.800> of

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
twice because if you pick up a speck of

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.640 
twice because if you pick up a speck of
dirt<00:04:31.100> or<00:04:31.510> debris<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.020> go<00:04:33.170> over<00:04:33.350> that<00:04:33.380> lens

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
dirt or debris and you go over that lens

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.270 
dirt or debris and you go over that lens
you<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:34.130> could<00:04:34.400> scratch<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:36.280> this

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
you you could scratch it so this

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.450 
you you could scratch it so this
particular<00:04:37.460> method<00:04:37.910> I'm<00:04:38.300> going<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.110> be

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
particular method I'm going to be

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.450 
particular method I'm going to be
rotating<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:41.690> tissue<00:04:41.960> as<00:04:42.320> I'm<00:04:42.920> cleaning<00:04:43.310> this

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
rotating the tissue as I'm cleaning this

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.310 
rotating the tissue as I'm cleaning this
just<00:04:44.060> just<00:04:44.360> using<00:04:44.600> different<00:04:44.900> parts<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.200> the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
just just using different parts of the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.820 
just just using different parts of the
tissue<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.420> pretty<00:04:47.660> clean<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.260> this

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
tissue this is pretty clean and this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.410 
tissue this is pretty clean and this
really<00:04:49.160> if<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.610> UV<00:04:49.790> cover<00:04:50.120> on<00:04:50.270> here

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
really if you have a UV cover on here

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.580 
really if you have a UV cover on here
well<00:04:50.750> it's<00:04:50.900> not<00:04:50.990> going<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.200> be<00:04:51.290> getting<00:04:51.500> that

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
well it's not going to be getting that

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.700 
well it's not going to be getting that
dirty<00:04:51.890> so<00:04:52.730> just<00:04:53.120> one<00:04:53.480> wipe<00:04:54.140> towards<00:04:54.590> the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
dirty so just one wipe towards the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.910 
dirty so just one wipe towards the
middle<00:04:54.980> this<00:04:55.670> is<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.000> way<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.120> like<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.360> do<00:04:56.630> it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
middle this is the way I like to do it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.020 
middle this is the way I like to do it
and<00:04:57.920> you'll<00:04:58.070> see<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.820> already

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
and you'll see that it's already

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.190 
and you'll see that it's already
evaporating<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:01.419> I'm<00:05:02.419> going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.960> use<00:05:03.169> a

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
evaporating and I'm going to use a

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.540 
evaporating and I'm going to use a
different<00:05:03.620> part<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.190> tissue<00:05:09.160> your<00:05:10.160> your

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
different part of the tissue your your

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.820 
different part of the tissue your your
main<00:05:10.760> lens<00:05:11.060> should<00:05:11.330> never<00:05:11.570> get<00:05:11.840> that<00:05:12.050> dirty<00:05:12.380> it

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
main lens should never get that dirty it

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.180 
main lens should never get that dirty it
really<00:05:13.070> shouldn't<00:05:13.370> ever<00:05:14.680> but<00:05:15.680> that's<00:05:15.919> how<00:05:16.130> you

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
really shouldn't ever but that's how you

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.860 
really shouldn't ever but that's how you
would<00:05:16.340> clean<00:05:16.460> this<00:05:16.760> now<00:05:16.820> this<00:05:17.120> also<00:05:17.360> applies

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
would clean this now this also applies

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.920 
would clean this now this also applies
to<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.500> lens<00:05:18.950> on<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.400> inside<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.510> camera

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
to the lens on the inside of the camera

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.550 
to the lens on the inside of the camera
so<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.680> one<00:05:21.830> facing<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.460> camera<00:05:22.850> mount<00:05:23.560> you

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
so the one facing the camera mount you

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.560 
so the one facing the camera mount you
can<00:05:24.740> also<00:05:24.919> clean<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.550> this<00:05:25.790> is<00:05:26.000> this<00:05:26.360> is

you can access it just remember to put

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.390 
you can access it just remember to put
the<00:05:52.880> solution<00:05:53.330> onto<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.050> tissue<00:05:54.260> don't<00:05:54.890> take
