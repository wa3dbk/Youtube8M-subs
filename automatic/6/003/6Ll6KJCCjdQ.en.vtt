00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
aircraft this is my first experience to

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.270 
aircraft this is my first experience to
visit<00:00:59.560> a<00:01:00.560> new<00:01:01.160> brand<00:01:01.570> aircraft<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.280> think

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
visit a new brand aircraft and I think

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.320 
visit a new brand aircraft and I think
also<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.030> plastic<00:01:05.960> cup<00:01:06.229> plus<00:01:06.619> as<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.970> great

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
also the plastic cup plus as a great

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.230 
also the plastic cup plus as a great
potential<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.189> very<00:01:11.180> important<00:01:11.689> segment

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
potential is a very important segment

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.640 
potential is a very important segment
price-wise<00:01:14.240> as<00:01:14.600> well<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.079> well<00:01:15.350> very

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
price-wise as well as well very

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.330 
price-wise as well as well very
interesting<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:17.630> think<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.409> this

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
interesting and I think that this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.810 
interesting and I think that this
aircraft<00:01:19.970> is<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.870> step<00:01:21.409> forward<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:21.980> Natalia

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
aircraft is a step forward for Natalia

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.390 
aircraft is a step forward for Natalia
and<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.300> Italy<00:01:23.690> because<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:24.890> important

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
and for Italy because it's not important

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.830 
and for Italy because it's not important
for<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.640> tourism<00:01:25.909> because<00:01:26.270> we<00:01:26.450> have<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.600> great

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
for the tourism because we have a great

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.219 
for the tourism because we have a great
connection<00:01:27.170> through<00:01:28.000> US<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.420> Italy<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.050> then

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
connection through US and Italy so then

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.520 
connection through US and Italy so then
we<00:01:30.440> improved<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.400> capacity<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.330> be<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:33.020> very

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
we improved the capacity to be a very

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.670 
we improved the capacity to be a very
high<00:01:33.770> level<00:01:34.070> with<00:01:34.400> quality<00:01:34.970> price<00:01:35.570> and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
high level with quality price and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.590 
high level with quality price and
comfort<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:36.920> that's<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.550> very<00:01:37.760> made<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.240> Italy

especially<00:02:04.600> obvious<00:02:04.810> if<00:02:04.900> you<00:02:05.020> are<00:02:05.080> Italian

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
especially obvious if you are Italian

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.320 
especially obvious if you are Italian
and<00:02:05.770> with<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> type<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:06.580> food<00:02:06.760> that<00:02:06.940> we<00:02:07.180> also

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
and with the type of food that we also

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.320 
and with the type of food that we also
tasted<00:02:07.960> today<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.619> think<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.460> combination<00:02:09.759> of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
tasted today I think the combination of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.390 
tasted today I think the combination of
everything<00:02:10.750> together<00:02:11.260> makes<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:12.070> full

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
everything together makes it a full

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.550 
everything together makes it a full
Italian<00:02:12.640> experience<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.450> think<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.080> this

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
Italian experience I think that this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.699 
Italian experience I think that this
aircraft<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.490> good<00:02:16.120> sign<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.990> new<00:02:17.440> company

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
aircraft is a good sign of a new company

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.320 
aircraft is a good sign of a new company
in<00:02:18.040> new<00:02:18.130> elite<00:02:18.370> ala<00:02:18.580> which<00:02:18.850> looks<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
in new elite ala which looks at the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.440 
in new elite ala which looks at the
future<00:02:19.930> over<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.530> last<00:02:20.709> year<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:21.190> have

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
future over the last year we have

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.990
