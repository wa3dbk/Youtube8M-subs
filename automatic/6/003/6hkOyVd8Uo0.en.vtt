00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
unique course I mean it isn't the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
unique course I mean it isn't the
typical<00:00:47.579> Gymkhana<00:00:48.360> course<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.800> know

typical Gymkhana course that you know
comes<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:50.489> mind<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
comes to my mind I think of the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
comes to my mind I think of the
traditional<00:00:52.469> Japanese<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.190> European<00:00:53.789> slow

traditional Japanese or European slow

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.720 
traditional Japanese or European slow
speed<00:00:54.510> style<00:00:54.840> Gymkhana<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
speed style Gymkhana but this is this is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
speed style Gymkhana but this is this is
much<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.020> high-impact<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
much more you know high-impact that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
much more you know high-impact that
we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.430> fast<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:00.390> were

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
we're going as fast as we are when were

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
we're going as fast as we are when were
drifting<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.829> close<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.670> road

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
drifting or you know close to road

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
drifting or you know close to road
racing<00:01:03.329> speeds<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.140> still<00:01:04.320> utilizing

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
racing speeds but we're still utilizing

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
racing speeds but we're still utilizing
the<00:01:05.010> elements<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the elements and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
the elements and
it's<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.230> cool<00:01:07.440> is<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.800> fall<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's kind of cool is that fall is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
it's kind of cool is that fall is
something<00:01:08.430> different<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.300> on<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.900> far<00:01:10.140> as

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
something different but on as far as

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
something different but on as far as
just<00:01:10.500> getting<00:01:10.800> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.920> cars<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.640> running

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just getting on the cars and running

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
just getting on the cars and running
tracks<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> nod<00:01:13.050> for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> drive

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
tracks I'm a nod for the drive

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.370 
tracks I'm a nod for the drive
everything

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
everything

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.160 
everything
and<00:01:14.470> I'd<00:01:14.710> like<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.159> definitely<00:01:15.990> put<00:01:16.990> together

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and I'd like to definitely put together

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.170 
and I'd like to definitely put together
a<00:01:17.380> car<00:01:17.680> potentially<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.580> we'll<00:01:18.790> see<00:01:18.939> how<00:01:19.030> this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
a car potentially and we'll see how this

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.170 
a car potentially and we'll see how this
Gymkhana<00:01:20.049> thing<00:01:20.259> shapes<00:01:20.530> up<00:01:20.799> and<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.909> know<00:01:22.030> if

Gymkhana thing shapes up and you know if

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.910 
Gymkhana thing shapes up and you know if
it<00:01:22.330> does<00:01:22.540> good<00:01:22.780> I'd<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:23.049> also<00:01:23.200> interested<00:01:23.860> in

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
it does good I'd be also interested in

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.260 
it does good I'd be also interested in
getting<00:01:23.979> into<00:01:24.280> some<00:01:24.460> rallycross<00:01:24.940> because

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
getting into some rallycross because

after watching the X Games this year and

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.219 
after watching the X Games this year and
seeing<00:01:27.310> Verde<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.700> throw<00:01:28.060> down<00:01:28.210> it's<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.690> that

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
seeing Verde a throw down it's a that

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.320 
seeing Verde a throw down it's a that
was<00:01:29.350> inspiring<00:01:29.770> I'd<00:01:30.549> like<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.850> go<00:01:30.970> out<00:01:31.119> there

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
was inspiring I'd like to go out there

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.170 
was inspiring I'd like to go out there
and<00:01:31.479> catch<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.780> there<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.430> that's<00:01:33.640> kind<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.060> in

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
and catch the there so that's kind of in

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.600 
and catch the there so that's kind of in
the<00:01:34.299> middle<00:01:34.600> somewhere<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:35.259> think<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.490> know

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the middle somewhere I think you know

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.460 
the middle somewhere I think you know
your<00:01:36.789> rallycross<00:01:37.299> in<00:01:37.570> your<00:01:37.659> Foreman

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.650 

those<00:01:42.770> are<00:01:42.950> still<00:01:43.130> going<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.340> be<00:01:43.570> staples<00:01:44.570> of

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
those are still going to be staples of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.110 
those are still going to be staples of
what<00:01:44.870> motor<00:01:45.080> sports<00:01:45.440> are<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.730> think

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
what motor sports are and then I think

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680 
what motor sports are and then I think
