it's<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.320> good<00:02:26.440> example<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:27.070> one<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.490> photo

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it's a good example of one of the photo

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.120 
it's a good example of one of the photo
layout<00:02:28.000> pages<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
