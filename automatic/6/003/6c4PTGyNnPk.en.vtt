put their animals in plastic containers
you<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> times<00:01:40.079> more

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you know it's a lot of the times more

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.539 
you know it's a lot of the times more
efficient<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.159> terms<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.670> humidity<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
efficient in terms of humidity and

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.710 
efficient in terms of humidity and
temperature<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.880> easier<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> regulate

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
temperature and it's easier to regulate

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
temperature and it's easier to regulate
those<00:01:45.899> things<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.560> more<00:01:46.860> convenient

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
those things and it's more convenient

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
those things and it's more convenient
and<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.670> cheaper<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.750> those<00:01:48.899> things

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and it's cheaper and all those things

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
and it's cheaper and all those things
but<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.829> lot<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> people<00:01:50.250> look<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but a lot of people look at this in a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380 
but a lot of people look at this in a
large<00:01:52.340> 55-gallon<00:01:53.340> enclosure<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.270> know

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
large 55-gallon enclosure with you know

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.899 
large 55-gallon enclosure with you know
which<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:54.930> big<00:01:55.170> sized<00:01:55.909> aquarium

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
which is a pretty big sized aquarium

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.420 
which is a pretty big sized aquarium
it's<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.240> three<00:01:57.780> by<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.890> glass<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's like three by two out of glass I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
it's like three by two out of glass I
think<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.780> bro<00:02:01.020> why<00:02:01.200> do

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
think they look at it like bro why do

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.600 
think they look at it like bro why do
you<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> ball<00:02:02.189> python<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you have a you know a ball python and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.190 
you have a you know a ball python and
here<00:02:02.880> why<00:02:02.969> don't<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.180> make<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.390> cool<00:02:03.659> vid<00:02:03.960> for

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
here why don't you make a cool vid for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200 
here why don't you make a cool vid for
like<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> rainbow<00:02:04.770> boa<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.430> something<00:02:05.790> else<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
like a rainbow boa or something else and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
like a rainbow boa or something else and
you<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> simple<00:02:07.409> reason<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.039> really

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you know the simple reason is I really

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
you know the simple reason is I really
like<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.700> snake<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
like the snake and I don't think you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.760 
like the snake and I don't think you
should<00:02:10.319> deprive<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.950> snake

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
should deprive a snake

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.790 
should deprive a snake
any<00:02:12.190> reptile<00:02:12.580> really<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.240> something<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.530> you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
any reptile really of something that you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.550 
any reptile really of something that you
know<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.280> provide<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:17.230> because

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
know you can provide it just because

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.230 
know you can provide it just because
it's<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.160> know<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.550> or<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.120> know<00:02:19.210> just

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
it's you know this or you know just

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.910 
it's you know this or you know just
because<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.080> ball<00:02:20.260> python<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.740> just

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
because it's a ball python or just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.440 
because it's a ball python or just
because<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.640> normal<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.270> know<00:02:22.300> you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
because it's a normal you know you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.260 
because it's a normal you know you
shouldn't<00:02:22.930> give<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.140> any<00:02:23.440> less<00:02:23.710> of<00:02:24.000> care<00:02:25.000> than

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
shouldn't give it any less of care than

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.700 
shouldn't give it any less of care than
you<00:02:25.390> would<00:02:25.570> any<00:02:25.810> other<00:02:25.840> snake<00:02:26.230> because<00:02:26.410> that's

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
you would any other snake because that's

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.710 
you would any other snake because that's
like<00:02:26.860> that's<00:02:27.070> like<00:02:27.190> saying<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.850> oh<00:02:28.030> because

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
like that's like saying that oh because

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.930 
like that's like saying that oh because

that person is black I should treat them

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.880 
that person is black I should treat them
you<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:32.020> worse<00:02:32.230> than<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.530> would<00:02:32.680> treat

you<00:02:57.820> bark<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:58.990> really<00:02:59.140> sure<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
you bark I'm not really sure what the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.620 
you bark I'm not really sure what the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
real purpose of that is I mean I guess

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.530 
real purpose of that is I mean I guess
this<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.380> easier<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:02.770> missed<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:04.030> rep<00:03:04.180> debark

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
this is easier to missed the rep debark

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.840 
this is easier to missed the rep debark

its<00:03:06.970> kind<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.210> molding<00:03:07.570> when<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.780> get<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:07.990> wet

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
its kind of molding when you get it wet

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.620 
its kind of molding when you get it wet
and<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:09.430> not<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.700> best<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.090> guess<00:03:10.330> it's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
and just not the best so I guess it's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.780 
and just not the best so I guess it's
more<00:03:11.170> for<00:03:11.350> humidity<00:03:11.680> adding<00:03:12.160> just<00:03:12.550> think<00:03:12.700> it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
more for humidity adding just think it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.150 
more for humidity adding just think it
kind<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:12.970> looks<00:03:13.150> cool<00:03:13.390> but<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.770> me<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
kind of looks cool but that's just me I
