00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.979
 hello guys and this again 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.960
 interesting infa super test and 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:08.780
 First of all, let's discuss the new 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.059
 map of normandy course working title 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.070
 this kids card but how you yourself can 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.440
 notice it is a teaching similar to that 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.540
 the terrain at which at the end of the second 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.490
 world war landed the Americans and 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.770
 after that they began to assure everyone that 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.630
 it was they who won the second world war 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.850
 by the way, I came across one site 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.530
 recently one question that all Western 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.480
 civilized people are sure to 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.300
 shaping how are you doing exactly america 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 Anise ussr and all losses ussr all his 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.550
 investing all his then you all his sacrifices 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 not just somehow ignored but carried 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.570
 as for the card itself if we 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
 look at the minimap then we will notice that 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.860
 the map itself is divided into three parts this 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.660
 huge beach is the middle with 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.130
 high ground and pillboxes and 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.829
 this is the right side there is a small 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.270
 such a wood and several tracks with one 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.980
 parties of course like when they can 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.250
 seem that the layout is original 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.260
 there is a bolt and destroyed tanks are smoking there 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.550
 ships are standing at the shore in general, it seems to be 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.050
 everything is good but on the other hand if 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.909
 look objectively in terms of 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.490
 gameplay we will see that map 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.830
 terribly open here let's say 5 here 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.870
 the beach is absolutely straight 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.950
 he is without any objects he is without 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.770
 any obstacles 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.870
 that is, in fact there will be one continuous 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.400
 standing and no btr but at the top yes y 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.610
 we have those some little house there 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.620
 barn but look again and very 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.500
 and very little and given that the artillery in 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.600
 lately be quite a lot then 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.549
 I'm already in Nguyen that most likely on this one 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.920
 map if it is in such a corner 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.869
 there would just be an attempt to sack under 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 houses and so on plus I'm not really 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.190
 I understand the meaning of this small 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.010
 a triangle of trees in the center of the map 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.320
 there is still lying around with the walls that it 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.000
 such a field is somehow incomprehensible who will 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.159
 go there than can be used 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.930
 probably with the same success phlegm cases and 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.030
 Could go there just lurk lakes and 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.770
 no one used it in the end but they 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.110
 so they decided to put this one there 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 a small professor and figs he knows what 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.970
 it is generally all guys of course 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.130
 beat the theme with landing allies in 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.229
 normandy is a good idea but me 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 it seems that in this form so far it 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.429
 will not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.500
 Th good map and which for the most 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.010
 parts will be stood under the stones stood 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.540
 under the cliffs near the beach and just afraid 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.310
 at least for some sweep a and 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.349
 general direction let's see how much 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.300
 limits will make the future and what is it 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.459
 the card will come to the general test 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.840
 because as you can see the map 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.190
 absolutely naked now 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.549
 she is absolutely without any 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.650
 special effects it has absolutely no graphics 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.090
 without anything there is just stupid objects 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.060
 and the very minimum 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.340
 graphic components so we 'll live 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.260
 see the second news dear viewers on 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.190
 today that I wanted to tell you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 fate kv-1s initiative 093 for this tanchik 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.870
 there will be two guns in the first course you 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.239
 already know that he will be called apt-85 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.519
 and you probably already know what start 122 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.989
 he has a millimeter left now 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.120
 the firing rate of this gun will be just 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.010
 three shots per minute that is from guys 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.379
 recharge will be somewhere around 20 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.470
 seconds and it's just some unreal 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.299
 paragraph accuracy of this instrument will be 0 5 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.040
 meaning writing harry dates accuracy 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.310
 flicker it almost like anyone barely 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.370
 grave owl information 3 and 4 and angle 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.220
 declination down alas will not be only -3 in 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.470
 In general, I want to say that 122 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.850
 millimeter will not be in any way on this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.280
 tank playable and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.440
 this gun probably added there 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.540
 just so that the players are not too 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.310
 loud world when it is tanchik next 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.440
 patch hed pe panel will be taken from him 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.530
 imported and beam but at the same time this 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.660
 KV -85 will appear another top gun this 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.340
 will be 100 millimeters rate of fire 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.599
 this cannon will be 789 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.049
 breaking 170 m 250 scatter but not such 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.079
 big 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.700
 038 about a mix of 27 this guys will be 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.829
 A good alternative to the old hundred 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.209
 twenty two millimeter cannon but 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.099
 Of course we will not have this 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.019
 mad alpha of course we no longer have 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.120
 there will be no such rural government 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.769
 will be only from 7 years old on the other hand we 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.260
 get more rat rate of fire 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.540
 better accuracy u maybe someone 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.959
 then this is more like it but for some reason I 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.000
 sure that whining and war in the comments 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.220
 no way to escape another interesting 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.069
 super dough drain changes 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.299
 development branches in patch 093 now 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.290
 guys you can see on your screens 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.120
 how to change 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.410
 rare and through that she will swing on 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.420
 new light tanks 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.070
 for example if you want to turn off yourself 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.080
 awesome lt american 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.320
 the wave will first go start and with 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.620
 him already on t37 then m41 bulldog and already 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.200
 then only t49 and already with t49 you guys 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.170
 be able to go for 541 and hamster and then for 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.090
 t57 heavy case tips you shake 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.500
 Glorious Soviet T-34 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.100
 from him mt-25 then ltb then 54 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.020
 lightweight 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.450
 they can write from 34 lite 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.890
 get on the regular t-54 so maybe i 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.170
 line of Soviet light tanks not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.140
 quite popular but with the Germans 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.600
 everything is just a leopard calls to part 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.120
 full panther and ru 251 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.180
 Well, the last for today if the frigate 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.490
 concerns object 430 will be drawn de vitry 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.440
 this is the tank the developers decided naturally 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.390
 and the way because he is really among 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.880
 all 100 and 10 levels but at least 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.760
 soviet headaches will be and 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.080
 playable what will they change in the first place 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.570
 will increase dpm from 2 1901 to 3 thousand 128 and 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.430
 hitting k guys after payment will be the most 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.500
 dcm tank among all medium tanks 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.790
 tenth level respectively and 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.540
 recharge accelerate 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.040
 6 and 6 to 6 1 plus will be upgraded accurate 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.230
 shooting on the go which means that I 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.340
 stabilization on this tank will improve but 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.200
 at the same time a little ponerfyat 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.980
 final accurate shooting at 100 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.480
 meters pitch 336 to 0 354 but this 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.970
 players will most likely not notice 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.340
 really object 430 build with 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.070
 object 140 or t-62a seems to me very 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.040
 poor it should have been a long time ago 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.840
 does apat help this one about tanchik u 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.280
 it's hard to say for now but of course 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.350
 play will become more comfortable 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.910
 general oksana guys major problems 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.640
 this tank seems to me it 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.710
 First bad stabilization immediately and in 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.260
 other Soviet and the country is good and 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.840
 This of course the fact that just a gun at all 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.850
 no way down and impenetrable 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.920
 This tank has no tower in general 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.670
 here's a conglomerate of different problems will do 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.460
 from this tank 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.350
 the worst st soviet level 10 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.150
 I hope the developers will fix it and 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.800
 make him something to say 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.389
 about and 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.069
 On this dear viewers this all 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.960
 interesting if you are a super test for 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.759
 today if you like these issues 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.250
 subscribe to the channel and of course it is 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:34.509
 like under this video and that's it for everyone 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.509
 thank you all bye 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.840
 and in fact 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.930
 all of a sudden 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.930
 you 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.059
 have your 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.350
 ipv6 will 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.350
 fibrosis
