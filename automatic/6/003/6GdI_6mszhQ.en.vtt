00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
very annoying and more than likely the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
very annoying and more than likely the
reason<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:37.829> using<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.460> thread

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
reason is that you're using a thread

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
reason is that you're using a thread
that<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> too<00:00:39.270> sick<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.739> you're<00:00:40.860> trying

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to do pebble in designs require a lot of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
to do pebble in designs require a lot of

cotton<00:00:51.390> threads<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.039> too

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
cotton threads are just a little too

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
thread and this is in my opinion one of
the<00:01:06.840> best<00:01:06.930> threads<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.460> type<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the best threads to use for this type of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
the best threads to use for this type of
stitch<00:01:09.210> work<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
stitch work as you can see this is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.539 
stitch work as you can see this is
fairly<00:01:11.850> time<00:01:12.299> consuming<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:14.220> most

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
fairly time consuming and with most

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.780 
fairly time consuming and with most
pedaling<00:01:15.240> designs<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.650> does<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> little

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pedaling designs it does take a little

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.590 
pedaling designs it does take a little
bit<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> time<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.140> fill<00:01:19.500> small<00:01:19.890> areas<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
bit of time just to fill small areas the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
bit of time just to fill small areas the
good<00:01:21.840> rule<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> thumb<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.549> increase

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
good rule of thumb would be to increase

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
good rule of thumb would be to increase
the<00:01:24.180> size<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.840> circles<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the size of your circles and then that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.760 
the size of your circles and then that
way<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.369> won't<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.670> quite<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:26.970> tiny<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
way they won't be quite so tiny and that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
way they won't be quite so tiny and that
way<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.220> fill<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.759> area<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> little

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
way they will fill your area a little

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.490 
way they will fill your area a little
bit<00:01:30.420> faster<00:01:31.340> another<00:01:32.340> good<00:01:32.610> idea<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.500> simply

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
bit faster another good idea is simply

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.249 
bit faster another good idea is simply
to<00:01:34.799> limit<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.759> size<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> area<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to limit the size of the area that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
to limit the size of the area that
you're<00:01:37.380> stitching<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you're stitching this in but the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
you're stitching this in but the
wonderful<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.470> peppering<00:01:41.340> designs

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
wonderful thing about peppering designs

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.810 
wonderful thing about peppering designs
is<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.799> anywhere<00:01:44.040> on

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is that they pretty much go anywhere on

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480 
is that they pretty much go anywhere on
your<00:01:44.850> quilt<00:01:45.270> they<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.810> fit<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.229> against<00:01:47.070> even

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
your quilt they can fit up against even

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
your quilt they can fit up against even
very<00:01:47.880> complicated<00:01:48.720> quilting<00:01:49.229> motifs<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
very complicated quilting motifs and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.800 
very complicated quilting motifs and
that's<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.450> designs

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that's something that some designs

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770 
that's something that some designs
absolutely<00:01:52.439> can't<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.360> versatile

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
absolutely can't do so it's a versatile

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.090 
absolutely can't do so it's a versatile
design<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.380> might<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> little<00:01:55.860> time

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
design it might be a little time

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
design it might be a little time
consuming<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.210> definitely<00:01:57.420> something

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
consuming but it's definitely something

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.620 
consuming but it's definitely something
that<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.530> work<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:59.009> any<00:01:59.549> area<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.270> quilt

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that will work on any area of your quilt

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389
