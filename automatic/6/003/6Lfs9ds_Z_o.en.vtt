00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.590
 friends and welcome today we are going to 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.810
 perform one of the best methods 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.700
 preventives that there may be for 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.490
 keep at bay insects like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.680
 pests and is to put several nest boxes in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.360
 our garden or orchard to attract 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.360
 the birds and that they help us 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 combat these pests we have also 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.619
 put a webcam on one of them 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.090
 to be able to follow the evolution of the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.100
 breeding the chickens with this in addition 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.820
 we help maintain the environment 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.400
 environmental of our area 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.800
 let's take as a base a small board 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.140
 no more than one centimeter thick to the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.480
 that we are going to make four holes with 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.489
 a bit of wood and we're going to give you a 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 width of three plugs and a length of 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.190
 four 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 It is interesting to use a wood that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 is not an agglomerate or against 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 plated and have a little bit of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 we will give you a varnish hand 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.089
 so that it lasts a little better 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.840
 inclement weather the rain and the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.550
 Sun 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.290
 When the varnish has dried well 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.030
 we started putting plugs with a 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.850
 contact glue all glued 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.379
 with each other and against hitting is 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.260
 say that we do not stay on top of others 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.080
 but as you see supports one in two 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.659
 we are leaving a gap for the door and 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.759
 we went up to 5 rows 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.249
 with this the body would be conformed 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.350
 main box the sixth row already 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.630
 would be the one that supports the roof and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.450
 we would put three plugs behind and two 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.429
 forward well centered the seventh 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 row would take two and two and the last 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.289
 would take one as you see is the way 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.819
 of the roof perfectly made and 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.219
 we come to the door for which we have 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.200
 We have been leaving the gap we are going to give 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.130
 a stop of four rows of stoppers and 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.140
 a width of a plug 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.179
 we make a hole for him to enter 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.729
 birds with a flat wood drill 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.409
 32 mm and we put a stick 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.620
 either by gluing it with silicone or 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.930
 piercing the door 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.110
 the varnish masters and we place it in the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.940
 hollow should enter us just and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.840
 hold on with the pressure that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.840
 they do the plugs 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.600
 We started to build the roof for 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.179
 which are we going to cut two tables of 14 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.340
 square centimeters long and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.020
 let's nail to each other with 3 brads 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.020
 right angles 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.760
 on the roof they will be stuck on the tiles 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 that are not going to be anything but plugs 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.030
 cut into slices of about two 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.340
 millimeters thick 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.200
 varnish we will make the roof and when 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.620
 dry we will start to paste our 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.620
 plugs 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.920
 we apply glue alone in the middle of 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 the surface of the eyebrows and pressing 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.140
 against the roof we force and the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.450
 we left stuck we started hitting 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.050
 down up making rows 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.050
 complete 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.690
 we make a first row of left 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.239
 to the right and the next one would be 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.489
 right to left like that until 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.410
 we reach the top we leave a small 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.860
 hollow up to place the auction 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.890
 end of the roof 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.560
 and we ended by putting half plugs 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.599
 all sides of the roof 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.819
 for the final shot we with a 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.390
 molding that has the exact shape for 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.060
 put it is going to come from pearls the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.950
 master varnish and stick it with glue 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.739
 contact on top of the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.170
 roof and it's practically finished 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.640
 our nest box will only need to cover 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.860
 the gap we had above the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.510
 door with two tax plugs 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.790
 horizontal or well placed vertically 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.849
 as we prefer and cover the gap that we 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.830
 it was between the upper plugs and 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.959
 the roof for which we are going to cut 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.260
 some plugs in rooms and we're going to 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.260
 paste 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.240
 the goal of putting the webcam is the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.340
 to follow both the laying of the eggs 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.790
 like raising the chickens by interfering 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.800
 as little as possible this is important 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.959
 that if we are bothering while it lasts 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 the raising of the chickens the parents can 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.230
 leave the nest and leave your luck to 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.790
 the chicks 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.370
 to place the foot of the camera 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.069
 we will use one method or another depending on the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.930
 foot that has in this case to be hollow 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.700
 with a couple of staples or with a couple of 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.359
 fins as we have done is more than 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.759
 enough 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.590
 and it's time to make the feeder 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.479
 it's interesting to put them near because 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.759
 this magician we are going to bring the most 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.189
 easily to the nest box we can 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.680
 fill with grain seed birdseed 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.990
 of nuts that yes whenever it is 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.200
 natural and untreated that is not fruit is 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.300
 the cost state salty and so on 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.980
 we will take a bottle of soda in the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.620
 that we will cut a window a little 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.390
 below half and just below 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.289
 this window we will place the stick for 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.360
 that poses some birds 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.059
 to hang the feeder will suffice 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.749
 make a hole in the stopper and pass it 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:55.610
 with a fine wire and knot this thing 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.559
 Same wire once placed again 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.240
 the cap on the bottle we can hang 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.860
 our feeder in any tree 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.860
 near there is the box level 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.060
 and so our work would be finished 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.310
 we will only need to put it in a tree 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.569
 close to home to connect the pc 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.429
 and continue raising the chickens 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.349
 we have to consider a couple of things 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:20.869
 more to orientate it towards the south to avoid 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.399
 the cold north winds and put it to 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:24.399
 less than two and a half meters or three 

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:27.679
 meters high to avoid 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:29.240
 predators like mice or snakes and 

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:31.320
 that our birds can feel 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.810
 insurance 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.580
 so nothing if you like the video give 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.770
 like and we will continue doing things for the 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.770
 orchard see you in the next chao
