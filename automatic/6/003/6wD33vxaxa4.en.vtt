the<00:02:22.670> reason<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.090> works<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the reason this works is that the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.960 
the reason this works is that the

the<00:02:33.440> case<00:02:34.300> remember<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> biceps
