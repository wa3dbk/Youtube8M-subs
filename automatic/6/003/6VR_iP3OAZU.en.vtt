00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
usage then we GB RAM is not bad but then

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.560 
usage then we GB RAM is not bad but then
again<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.659> know<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.850> buying<00:01:39.090> even<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
want at least 4gb RAM another problem

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
want at least 4gb RAM another problem
with<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> lack<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.560> ports<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.250> got

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
with this is the lack of ports it's got

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.539 
with this is the lack of ports it's got
two<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.240> two<00:01:48.570> USB<00:01:49.110> ports<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.460> an

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
two the two USB ports over here and an

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.139 
two the two USB ports over here and an
HDMI<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.430> small<00:01:53.700> number<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
HDMI so that is a really small number of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.590 
HDMI so that is a really small number of
ports<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.170> mean<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:56.430> were<00:01:56.610> netbooks

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
ports you can I mean there were netbooks

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
ports you can I mean there were netbooks
earlier<00:01:57.990> which<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.710> much<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.670> number

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
earlier which are much much more number

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.149 
earlier which are much much more number
of<00:02:00.210> ports<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:01.350> would<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> been<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> better

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of ports which would have been a better

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.030 
of ports which would have been a better
thing<00:02:02.520> had<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> solution<00:02:03.560> overall<00:02:04.560> looking<00:02:04.890> at

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
thing had a solution overall looking at

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.399 
thing had a solution overall looking at
this<00:02:05.159> laptop<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:06.780> bad<00:02:07.110> if

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
this laptop is it's not really bad if

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.490 
this laptop is it's not really bad if
you<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.799> something<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.569> simple<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you want something you know simple and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.910 
you want something you know simple and
if<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
if you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.100 
if you
something<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.390> simple<00:02:12.690> usage

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
something just just for simple usage

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.320 
something just just for simple usage
then<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.430> bad<00:02:14.610> you've<00:02:14.880> got<00:02:14.910> your

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
then it's not really bad you've got your

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.470 
then it's not really bad you've got your
other<00:02:15.450> options<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.440> SC's<00:02:16.890> HP<00:02:17.640> stream<00:02:17.940> 11

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
other options like the SC's HP stream 11

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.800 
other options like the SC's HP stream 11
what<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.350> these<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.770> 11<00:02:20.250> inch<00:02:20.630> 11.6<00:02:21.630> inch

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
what of these have 11 inch 11.6 inch

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.890 
what of these have 11 inch 11.6 inch
screens<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.060> also<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:24.690> go

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
screens so that is also and then go

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.830 
screens so that is also and then go
quite<00:02:25.290> light<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.520> one<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:27.090> updated

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
quite light but this one is updated

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.350 
quite light but this one is updated
hardware<00:02:28.290> better<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.370> faster<00:02:29.550> hardware<00:02:30.209> of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
hardware better and faster hardware of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.970 
hardware better and faster hardware of
course<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.080> screen<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.830> on<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.870> is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
course the screen also on this is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.699 
course the screen also on this is
comparatively<00:02:34.980> better<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.520> think<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:37.200> viewing

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
comparatively better I think the viewing

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.830 
comparatively better I think the viewing
angles<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> screen<00:02:38.580> are<00:02:38.910> not<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.570> bad

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
angles on the screen are not that bad

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.470 
angles on the screen are not that bad
it's<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:41.130> course<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.910> you're<00:02:42.120> buying<00:02:42.300> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
it's of course if you're buying a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.180 
it's of course if you're buying a
netbook<00:02:42.780> you're<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.140> really<00:02:43.590> looking<00:02:43.920> to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
netbook you're not really looking to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.940 
netbook you're not really looking to
watch<00:02:44.910> enemies<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> lot<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.930> people<00:02:46.320> but

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
watch enemies with a lot of people but

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.830 
watch enemies with a lot of people but
just<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.520> your<00:02:47.610> regular<00:02:47.820> usage<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.570> viewing

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
just for your regular usage the viewing

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.199 
just for your regular usage the viewing
angles<00:02:49.170> will<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.560> worse<00:02:49.769> also<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.940> want

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
angles will do worse also so if you want

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.570 
angles will do worse also so if you want
something<00:02:51.480> under<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> budget<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.709> simple<00:02:53.400> this

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
something under a budget and simple this

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.729 
something under a budget and simple this
looks<00:02:53.850> quite<00:02:54.150> good<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.900> we'll<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> course

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
looks quite good but we'll of course

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.490 
looks quite good but we'll of course
wait<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> full<00:02:57.209> review<00:02:57.450> before<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:58.110> give
