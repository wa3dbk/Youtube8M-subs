throughout the entire game and the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.220 
throughout the entire game and the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the only tighten that I use in the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.740 
the only tighten that I use in the
entire<00:00:19.710> game<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.220> like<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> Titan

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
entire game I like to be the Titan

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
entire game I like to be the Titan
that's<00:00:21.900> either<00:00:22.050> medium<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.769> short<00:00:22.800> distance

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that's either medium and short distance

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.099 
that's either medium and short distance
battles<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> other<00:00:24.420> players<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.019> I'm

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
battles with the other players and I'm

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
battles with the other players and I'm
specifically<00:00:25.710> always<00:00:25.980> using<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> Strider

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
specifically always using the Strider

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.730 
specifically always using the Strider
just<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> has<00:00:27.390> three<00:00:27.660> dashes<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.289> think

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
just because it has three dashes I think

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.720 
just because it has three dashes I think
the<00:00:28.800> three<00:00:28.980> dashes<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> most

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the three dashes are one of the most

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.099 
the three dashes are one of the most
important<00:00:30.240> things<00:00:30.420> about<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.810> Titan

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
important things about the Titan

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
important things about the Titan
loadouts<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:32.550> used<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.450> in

loadouts and I'm used to you know in
Halo<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.079> always<00:00:34.320> running<00:00:34.649> away<00:00:34.739> once<00:00:35.100> my

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
Halo just always running away once my

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
Halo just always running away once my
shields<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.700> weak<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.450> having<00:00:36.630> three

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
shields are weak and so having three

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
shields are weak and so having three
dashes<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.590> great<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.040> me<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.700> is

using<00:01:22.200> electric<00:01:22.740> smoke<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.280> my

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
using electric smoke is because my

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.130 
using electric smoke is because my
ordinance<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> cluster<00:01:24.780> min<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.020> now

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
ordinance I have a cluster min so now

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780 
ordinance I have a cluster min so now
the<00:01:25.200> cluster<00:01:25.560> missile<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.640> soon

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the cluster missile we all know as soon

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
the cluster missile we all know as soon
as<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> shoot<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.600> explodes<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> bunch<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
as you shoot it just explodes a bunch of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
as you shoot it just explodes a bunch of
grenades<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.060> like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
grenades so what I like to do is I like

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
grenades so what I like to do is I like
to<00:01:30.240> set<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> cluster<00:01:31.020> missile<00:01:31.350> behind<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
to set up the cluster missile behind of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
to set up the cluster missile behind of
the<00:01:32.009> enemy<00:01:32.310> Titan<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.700> enemy<00:01:33.060> enemies<00:01:33.630> period

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the enemy Titan or enemy enemies period

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
the enemy Titan or enemy enemies period
shoot<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.490> side<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
shoot that and then on the other side of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
shoot that and then on the other side of
it<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.119> put<00:01:36.299> electric<00:01:36.720> smoke<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.380> there's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it I put electric smoke down so there's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.830 
it I put electric smoke down so there's
two<00:01:37.770> different<00:01:37.950> spots<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.610> area<00:01:39.150> damage<00:01:39.329> going

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
two different spots of area damage going

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
two different spots of area damage going
down<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.799> fighting<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> Titan<00:01:41.460> they're

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
down so if I'm fighting a Titan they're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.069 
down so if I'm fighting a Titan they're
going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.939> hit<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> from<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> smoke<00:01:42.840> or

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
going to get hit you from the smoke or

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
going to get hit you from the smoke or
the<00:01:43.200> grenades<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.399> people<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:44.939> trying<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the grenades and if people are trying to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
the grenades and if people are trying to
run<00:01:45.299> away<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.110> blocked<00:01:46.500> off

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
run away they just all blocked off

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
run away they just all blocked off
because<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> grenades<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.430> smoke<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
because the grenades and smoke so it's a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
because the grenades and smoke so it's a
very<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.840> Titan<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> keep<00:01:49.920> people<00:01:50.130> trapped

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
very good Titan to keep people trapped

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.450 
very good Titan to keep people trapped
in<00:01:50.729> certain<00:01:51.270> locations<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.829> Titan

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
in certain locations and if I Titan

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.100 
in certain locations and if I Titan
catches<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> off<00:01:53.909> guard<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:54.840> smoke

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
catches you off guard you can just smoke

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
catches you off guard you can just smoke
them<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.590> throw<00:01:55.920> down<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> cluster

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
them and then throw down the cluster

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
them and then throw down the cluster
miss<00:01:56.670> oh<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> you're<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.210> basically<00:01:57.390> reckon

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
miss oh and you're just basically reckon

month next time like it's my tier one
kid<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> fast<00:02:01.229> autoloader<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.799> think

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
kid I have the fast autoloader I think

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
kid I have the fast autoloader I think
the<00:02:02.070> cluster<00:02:02.430> missile<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the cluster missile it's just one of the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
the cluster missile it's just one of the
most<00:02:03.600> incredible<00:02:04.140> ordinances<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> game

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
most incredible ordinances in the game

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
most incredible ordinances in the game
all<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.939> extra<00:02:06.240> grenades<00:02:06.540> blowing<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.990> does

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
all the extra grenades blowing up does

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.949 
all the extra grenades blowing up does
massive<00:02:08.099> massive<00:02:08.340> damage<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.479> other<00:02:09.599> Titan

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
massive massive damage the other Titan

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.660 
massive massive damage the other Titan
so<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.200> why<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> fast<00:02:11.160> autoloader

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so that's why I have the fast autoloader

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
so that's why I have the fast autoloader

like<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.780> said<00:02:27.990> my<00:02:28.140> favorite<00:02:28.530> thing<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
like I said my favorite thing is to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.220 
like I said my favorite thing is to
sneak<00:02:29.430> up<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.730> flank<00:02:30.030> behind<00:02:30.300> enemies<00:02:30.660> as

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
sneak up and flank behind enemies as

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.020 
sneak up and flank behind enemies as
soon<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.709> behind<00:02:31.980> an<00:02:32.160> enemy<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.459> will<00:02:32.790> shoot

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
soon as I'm behind an enemy I will shoot

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
soon as I'm behind an enemy I will shoot
the<00:02:33.180> smoke<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.930> dash<00:02:34.200> away<00:02:34.410> from<00:02:34.680> them

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
the smoke down and dash away from them

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320 
the smoke down and dash away from them
and<00:02:34.980> they'll<00:02:35.070> most<00:02:35.280> likely<00:02:35.400> try<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.880> dash<00:02:36.150> away

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and they'll most likely try to dash away

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.790 
and they'll most likely try to dash away
as<00:02:36.540> well<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.170> that's<00:02:37.260> where<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> shoot<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
as well so that's where I shoot the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.500 
as well so that's where I shoot the
cluster<00:02:38.220> mr.<00:02:38.459> behind<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.880> smokes<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.360> this

cluster mr. behind the smokes it this
way<00:02:39.690> i'm<00:02:39.930> hitting<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> enemy<00:02:41.100> Titan<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.580> two

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
way i'm hitting the enemy Titan with two
