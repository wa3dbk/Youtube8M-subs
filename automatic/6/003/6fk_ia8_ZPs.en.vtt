full-sized tech lock that would fit and
I<00:04:15.359> don't<00:04:15.419> have<00:04:15.689> a<00:04:15.750> smaller<00:04:16.139> tech<00:04:16.440> lock<00:04:16.680> handy

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
I don't have a smaller tech lock handy

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.370 
I don't have a smaller tech lock handy
to<00:04:18.030> see<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.389> measurements<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:18.959> between<00:04:19.259> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
to see the measurements in between the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.469 
to see the measurements in between the
spacing<00:04:19.859> on<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.070> fasteners<00:04:20.519> there<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:21.329> that

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
spacing on the fasteners there for that

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.800 
spacing on the fasteners there for that
but<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.650> this<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.029> not<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.210> bad<00:04:24.479> setup

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
but this is this this is not a bad setup

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.920
