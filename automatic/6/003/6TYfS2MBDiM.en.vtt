after you've written a few more pieces

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
after you've written a few more pieces
you<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> director<00:01:17.610> come<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> play

you have the director come and you play

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
you have the director come and you play
them<00:01:18.330> off<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.720> computer<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.890> have

them off of your computer and they have

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
them off of your computer and they have
to<00:01:20.130> sound<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.520> good<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to sound really good because that's the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.969 
to sound really good because that's the
expectation<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.170> bar<00:01:22.350> has<00:01:22.470> been<00:01:22.560> raised<00:01:22.740> very

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
expectation the bar has been raised very

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.020 
expectation the bar has been raised very
very<00:01:23.220> high<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.320> think<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.680> studio<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.820> my

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
very high I think of my studio as my

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.609 
very high I think of my studio as my
instrument<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> extent<00:01:29.579> no

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
instrument and to that extent no

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.080 
instrument and to that extent no
instrumentalist<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:32.040> truly<00:01:32.700> move<00:01:32.909> an

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
instrumentalist can truly move an

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.749 
instrumentalist can truly move an
audience<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.570> they're<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:34.759> brilliant

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
audience if they're not really brilliant

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.840 
audience if they're not really brilliant
at<00:01:35.850> their<00:01:36.030> instruments<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.340> an

Lynn is very important very important

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.839 
Lynn is very important very important
because<00:02:20.310> there's<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.389> difference<00:02:21.810> between

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
because there's a difference between

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.369 
because there's a difference between
passable<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.680> brilliant<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.239> also<00:02:28.049> for

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
passable and brilliant so and also for

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.839 
passable and brilliant so and also for
me<00:02:28.530> since<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:29.010> lot<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.189> my<00:02:29.370> scores<00:02:29.700> are

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
me since a lot of my scores are

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.979 
me since a lot of my scores are
electronic<00:02:30.480> anyway<00:02:31.349> my<00:02:32.340> demos<00:02:32.760> are<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.569> final

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
electronic anyway my demos are the final

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.509 
electronic anyway my demos are the final
score<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.250> they<00:02:35.370> better<00:02:35.519> be<00:02:35.760> damn<00:02:36.480> good<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
score so they better be damn good and

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.770 
score so they better be damn good and
put<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.549> lot<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.760> thought<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.299> into<00:02:39.689> it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
put a lot of thought in it into it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.420 
put a lot of thought in it into it
because<00:02:39.900> anybody<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.560> go<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:41.069> store<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
because anybody can go to a store and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.470 
because anybody can go to a store and
buy<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.639> synthesizer<00:02:42.269> whether<00:02:43.200> it's<00:02:43.439> you<00:02:44.249> know

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
buy a synthesizer whether it's you know

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.759 
buy a synthesizer whether it's you know
hardware<00:02:45.480> or<00:02:45.629> software<00:02:45.659> whatever<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
hardware or software whatever and it

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.429 
hardware or software whatever and it
comes<00:02:47.010> with<00:02:47.389> 500<00:02:48.389> patches<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.049> everybody

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
comes with 500 patches and everybody

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.250 
comes with 500 patches and everybody
uses<00:02:49.769> them<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.419> drum<00:02:51.419> machines<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:51.989> loops

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
uses them and drum machines with loops

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.530 
uses them and drum machines with loops
and<00:02:52.560> everybody<00:02:52.919> uses<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.189> same<00:02:53.430> loops<00:02:53.699> and<00:02:54.000> it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
and everybody uses the same loops and it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.099 
and everybody uses the same loops and it
becomes<00:02:55.189> it<00:02:56.189> becomes<00:02:56.359> predictable<00:02:57.359> and<00:02:58.019> it

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
becomes it becomes predictable and it

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.809 
becomes it becomes predictable and it
becomes<00:02:58.500> cliche<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:01.560> believe<00:03:02.519> very

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
becomes cliche so I believe very

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.629 
becomes cliche so I believe very
strongly<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.389> my<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.949> depth<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.459> my

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
where my music lies in my studio I then

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.589 
where my music lies in my studio I then
have<00:03:57.719> another<00:03:58.340> couple<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.430> outside<00:04:00.030> computers

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
have another couple of outside computers

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.770 
have another couple of outside computers
just<00:04:01.409> for<00:04:01.650> holding<00:04:01.979> onto<00:04:02.129> orchestral<00:04:03.000> samples

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
just for holding onto orchestral samples

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.719 
just for holding onto orchestral samples
so<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.889> don't<00:04:05.009> have<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.219> reopen<00:04:05.400> them

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
so that I don't have to reopen them

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.099 
so that I don't have to reopen them
every<00:04:05.909> time<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.120> open<00:04:06.239> up<00:04:06.509> a<00:04:06.569> new<00:04:06.599> song<00:04:06.900> because

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
every time I open up a new song because

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.659 
every time I open up a new song because
it<00:04:07.139> can<00:04:07.290> take<00:04:07.439> a<00:04:07.500> long<00:04:07.739> time<00:04:07.819> so<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:10.669> two

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
it can take a long time so I have two

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.080 
it can take a long time so I have two
computers<00:04:12.030> just<00:04:12.750> for<00:04:13.639> just<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.729> sort<00:04:14.939> of<00:04:14.969> a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
computers just for just a sort of a

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.039 
computers just for just a sort of a
sample<00:04:15.389> farm<00:04:16.849> everything<00:04:17.849> moves<00:04:18.049> digitally

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
sample farm everything moves digitally

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.529 
sample farm everything moves digitally
through<00:04:19.590> my<00:04:19.680> studio<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.489> flows<00:04:21.180> into<00:04:21.419> a

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
through my studio and it flows into a

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.810 
through my studio and it flows into a
