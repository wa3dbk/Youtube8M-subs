00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
suggestions for your training I've only
been<00:01:29.460> doing<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.790> two<00:01:30.000> days<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.450> far<00:01:30.659> but

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
been doing this two days so far but

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.700 
been doing this two days so far but
something<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.549> taking<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.670> nap<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.229> one<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
something like taking a nap is one that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
suggestions based off of the rpe and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.990 
suggestions based off of the rpe and
fatigue<00:01:38.670> percent<00:01:39.119> system<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.340> drop<00:01:41.340> two

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
fatigue percent system so drop two

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
fatigue percent system so drop two
percent<00:01:42.390> fatigue<00:01:42.750> load<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.290> add<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.829> percent

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
percent fatigue load or add two percent

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.600 
percent fatigue load or add two percent
fatigue<00:01:44.460> load<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:44.880> feeling<00:01:45.210> good<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
fatigue load if you're feeling good so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
fatigue load if you're feeling good so
we're<00:01:47.790> gonna<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> test<00:01:48.479> now<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
we're gonna get to the test now and this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
we're gonna get to the test now and this
will<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.610> accurate<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> heart<00:01:51.420> rate

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
will be more accurate with a heart rate

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.310 
will be more accurate with a heart rate
monitor<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.530> getting<00:01:54.200> hopefully<00:01:55.200> later

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
monitor that I'm getting hopefully later

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.370 
monitor that I'm getting hopefully later
today<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:56.240> we'll<00:01:57.240> give<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> I'll

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
today but we'll give it a go and I'll

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.300 
today but we'll give it a go and I'll
let<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.590> guys<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.979> how<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> works<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
let you guys know how this works so I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
let you guys know how this works so I
did<00:02:02.729> end<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:02.969> picking<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.570> heart<00:02:03.899> rate

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
did end up picking up a heart rate

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.590 
did end up picking up a heart rate
monitor<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> polar<00:02:05.460> ft<00:02:05.969> 4<00:02:06.329> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
monitor this is the polar ft 4 and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.119 
monitor this is the polar ft 4 and
picked<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.899> off<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.110> Amazon<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
picked it up off the Amazon I think it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:08.550 
picked it up off the Amazon I think it
was<00:02:08.220> one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
was one

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.440 
was one
a<00:02:08.640> combination<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.700> highest<00:02:10.000> rated<00:02:10.300> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
a combination of highest rated and

with<00:02:12.130> what<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.280> go<00:02:12.459> for<00:02:12.700> for<00:02:12.880> everything<00:02:13.709> comes

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
with what I go for for everything comes

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.150 
with what I go for for everything comes
with<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.920> strap<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.520> you'll<00:02:15.730> strap<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:17.160> sensor

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
with a strap so you'll strap that sensor

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.449 
with a strap so you'll strap that sensor
around<00:02:18.760> your<00:02:19.090> low<00:02:19.360> chest<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.160> lie<00:02:21.160> down<00:02:21.220> on

the floor rest for two minutes then take

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.490 
the floor rest for two minutes then take
your<00:02:23.830> average<00:02:23.950> heart<00:02:24.310> rate<00:02:24.540> stand-up<00:02:25.540> record

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
your high and your low and then you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.420 
your high and your low and then you
final<00:02:28.180> average<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> what<00:02:30.040> you'll<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.310> when

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
final average and what you'll get when

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.949 
final average and what you'll get when
you<00:02:30.489> input<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:30.940> data<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.510> something<00:02:31.870> like

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
you input that data is something like

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.479 
you input that data is something like
this

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
this

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.880 
this
this<00:02:33.489> is<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.150> page<00:02:34.780> from<00:02:34.989> track<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.650> I've

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
this is the page from track and I've

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.210 
this is the page from track and I've
recorded<00:02:36.190> seven<00:02:36.640> days<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.030> data<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.720> far<00:02:38.220> let's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
recorded seven days of data so far let's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.070 
recorded seven days of data so far let's
take<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> look<00:02:39.610> at<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.760> graph<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.480> top<00:02:40.720> left

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
take a look at the graph in the top left

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.009 
take a look at the graph in the top left
and<00:02:41.400> note<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.430> there's<00:02:42.880> two<00:02:43.120> lines<00:02:43.390> combined

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
and note that there's two lines combined

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.729 
and note that there's two lines combined
stress<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.709> weekly<00:02:45.130> average<00:02:45.640> stress<00:02:46.000> so

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
stress and weekly average stress so

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.800 
stress and weekly average stress so
combined<00:02:47.739> stress<00:02:48.040> comes<00:02:48.310> from<00:02:48.400> all<00:02:49.269> areas<00:02:49.660> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
combined stress comes from all areas of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.140 
combined stress comes from all areas of
life<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.850> sleep<00:02:51.850> can<00:02:52.330> be<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> good<00:02:53.340> factor<00:02:54.340> for

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
life and sleep can be a good factor for

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.410 
life and sleep can be a good factor for
that

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.210 
that
and<00:02:55.510> finally<00:02:56.049> weekly<00:02:56.349> average<00:02:56.650> comes<00:02:57.010> from

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
and finally weekly average comes from

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.580 
and finally weekly average comes from
workload<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:58.840> see<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.380> lines

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
workload so you can see that the lines

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.410 
workload so you can see that the lines
crossed<00:02:59.980> they're<00:03:00.220> indicating<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:00.940> at<00:03:01.239> least

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
crossed they're indicating that at least

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.530 
crossed they're indicating that at least
for<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.660> short<00:03:01.720> time<00:03:02.700> my<00:03:03.700> weekly<00:03:04.360> average

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
for a short time my weekly average

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.020 
for a short time my weekly average
stress<00:03:04.900> was<00:03:05.110> below<00:03:05.440> my<00:03:05.620> combined<00:03:06.040> stress<00:03:06.340> in

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
stress was below my combined stress in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.300 
stress was below my combined stress in
looking<00:03:07.870> at<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.110> bottom<00:03:08.560> graph<00:03:08.769> we'll<00:03:09.069> see

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
looking at the bottom graph we'll see

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.949 
looking at the bottom graph we'll see
that<00:03:09.549> during<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.150> same<00:03:10.510> period<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.900> time

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
that during that same period of time

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.410 
that during that same period of time
we'll<00:03:11.799> note<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.280> my<00:03:12.459> recovery<00:03:12.880> rate<00:03:13.209> was

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
we'll note that my recovery rate was

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.500 
we'll note that my recovery rate was
below<00:03:13.660> my<00:03:14.470> global<00:03:15.250> fatigue<00:03:15.579> load<00:03:15.790> which<00:03:16.390> is

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
below my global fatigue load which is

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.289 
below my global fatigue load which is
important<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.900> note<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.200> for<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.680> while<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.640> was

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
important to note that for a while I was

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.370 
important to note that for a while I was
I<00:03:20.010> was<00:03:21.010> adding<00:03:21.609> fatigue<00:03:22.049> faster<00:03:23.049> than<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.260> was

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
I was adding fatigue faster than I was

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.300 
I was adding fatigue faster than I was
able<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.829> recover<00:03:25.530> which<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.859> is<00:03:27.010> important

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
able to recover which this is important

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.710 
able to recover which this is important
information<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.760> have<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.390> comes<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
information to have and this comes to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.620 
information to have and this comes to
the<00:03:28.810> question<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:29.290> why<00:03:29.920> would<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.340> need<00:03:30.630> more

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the question of why would we need more

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.430 
the question of why would we need more
data<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.290> terms<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.160> our<00:03:34.000> training<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.630> I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
data in terms of our training and I

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.099 
data in terms of our training and I
think<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.769> answer<00:03:36.069> really<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.989> what<00:03:37.989> we

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
think the answer really is that what we

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.780 
think the answer really is that what we
need<00:03:38.350> are<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.920> be<00:03:39.040> able<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.190> make<00:03:39.400> informed

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
need are to be able to make informed

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.699 
need are to be able to make informed
decisions<00:03:39.940> about<00:03:40.389> how<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.840> change<00:03:41.170> training
