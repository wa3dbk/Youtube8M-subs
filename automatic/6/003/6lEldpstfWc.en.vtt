00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.610
 hello girls then cultivation of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.930
 the first recipe 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.670
 optimizing coconut milk and this notebook 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.750
 I talked to you and switch to videos I discovered I bought from dollars like 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.730
 explained how to do it at home 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.839
 is 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.439
 lecce evening 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.679
 then we use this coconut milk we make a hair pack 3 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.340
 shampoo then let's go get our coconut milk here it is 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.859
 and we take is the upper part this water lasts this money 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.320
 and let's take a nice spoon, here's some quo milk here 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.130
 and we go to put in our pebble 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.490
 see how hard this is 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.739
 then at this time I tell you cook and salt mine I say here 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.100
 if you go to add to the ghini 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 honey and we add 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.780
 a spoon 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.310
 in full flood 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.100
 you divine that you know that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 it is one of the ingredients that I prefer over hair 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.410
 and then we put a spoon 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.310
 weed intro 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.530
 occhei 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.280
 then after honey 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.150
 we put 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.409
 a bit of wheat germ oil is a little almond oil 2 pcs 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.130
 then I use these two types of oils or to make a dead reinforcing wrap 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.700
 it is not intended because otherwise I and the oils usually do not use bishamon 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.039
 face impact once a week with mil me moments we say in that of 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.090
 parts are to be understood chianche whenever they boxing them 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.750
 however it is not right 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.119
 always of hydraulic hair oils 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.060
 even in small quantities I only really use my hair 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.909
 stressed for example after the sea does this hour or if I am in period that 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.090
 really really are very written 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.650
 so in this case I hate going to put a single teaspoon god - 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.290
 mixed it will make sweet almond that was of wheat germ my mind can 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.699
 consider it appropriate 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.689
 to put pegs because you only like dates and works life is 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.220
 particularly dry 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.610
 I also have not just for any reason you can easily add the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.690
 amount of oil 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.900
 I have to iron in another thing for which 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.530
 another reason why I don't move that after that on the hair later 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.199
 having made the wrap 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.960
 is the only thing that I can hardly remove then 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.869
 I have to do halo 2 samp instead of one that I usually always shampoo 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:43.159
 I have to make saints and therefore also using a product we say that they do 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.489
 stability however is too aggressive for my hair and therefore 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.509
 for this I try not to 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.210
 avoid putting eggs 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.760
 in this thing called only a teaspoon then 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.550
 mimi can only do good and put it says american praise mando veteran chosen album 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.370
 therefore half of this is half of the wheat germ eliminating the lights and 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.320
 what I wanted to say that obviously if you don't have these two oils you can 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.970
 also use the other six gods you have them you cashes in peace 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.499
 here I am not wearing a bit of christ 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.499
 and then I put some hard almonds 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.619
 final fill the teaspoon and bake like this and this is the quantity 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:32.239

 you can really use what the tired stamps are good for 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.969
