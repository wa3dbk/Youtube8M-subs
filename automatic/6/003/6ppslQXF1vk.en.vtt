00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
 Hello everyone today I want to brag 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:14.280
 such a parcel is long-awaited to me 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.910
 finally came cutting thread moulin 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:23.310
 and many probably know heard about 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.580
 card colors of clay until it is generally 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:34.430
 what 's wrong for manufacturers but they cost 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:37.380
 not cheap and so when I saw that 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.370
 some girls buy like that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.719
 called marinette threading like 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 would be an analogue color map 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:52.559
 I wanted the same so carefully 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.100
 all and while I bought two cards at once 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 colors 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:06.780
 This strings gamma and strings directly from under 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.950
 see the software 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.920
 Of course, you can make such color cards 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.030
 yourself gradually because 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 Naturally buy all the numbers at once 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.880
 strings 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.780
 it will be very expensive therefore only 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.570
 gradually 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:35.620
 if you do it yourself like this we already get 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.710
 slips looks like a color map of course 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.010
 completely different than those who 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.380
 branded sold in stores there 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.310
 strings like you wound such plosechki 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:54.040
 small and pasted the catalog here such 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.740
 small pieces of strings 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 they are about 18 20 centimeters long 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.610
 tied to such here how would 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:10.209
 The organizer has signed on them 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:13.209
 number above each thread under each 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.150
 color can be seen as many of them that is, we 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.600
 really buy and do it yourself 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.030
 in the color map 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.730
 I know that she is 9 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.030
 doing and in various ways 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.200
 someone embroider each color someone well 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.620
 something like that makes it different 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.620
 there are girls fantasize but here I am 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.050
 I thought it would be either very good 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.010
 long and make these color cards 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.319
 either very expensive and so 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 I am very satisfied with the option you see 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:55.410
 what a huge amount of strings here 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.750
 I don't remember the exact number 460 somewhere 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.769
 dms thread colors in general for what we need 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.880
 color map 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.910
 why I actually wanted to 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.500
 see them in stock 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.480
 Recently, more and more like that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.750
 it happens that I buy copyright schemes 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.720
 for example designer where flowers of strings 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.310
 shown dns 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.600
 go of course you can go and buy 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:33.050
 just indicated numbers 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 this is for some kind of embroidery specific 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.210
 but as the rules of design schemes 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.300
 quite often quite large 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.180
 number of flowers and some of them 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.080
 used example quite a bit yes 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:53.570
 there are a little bit of crosses there 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.550
 20-30-40 100 that's quite likely that I 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.130
 I can pick from available 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.650
 the threads that I have left of 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.500
 some sets lie with immemorial 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.660
 times and so on that is to not 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.990
 buy extra . tychek dms sake 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.880
 several crosses yes actually for 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.459
 this is what the color map is for 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.959
 considering that strings are now too 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:24.080
 imitated very much i can just 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.670
 take and pick from the available 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:33.890
 some leftovers by attaching to the right 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:36.530
 Pit number picked up something this one 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.240
 such opportunity second opportunity 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.040
 pick up cheaper strings because 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.430
 that home from strings is enough 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.490
 expensive if you have a map of two colors 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.890
 Companies I can translate the scheme for example 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.680
 flowers tyke gamma for this proper 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.230
 I took another color map 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.640
 namely in the gamut because in principle in 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.000
 gamma nerve strings 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.919
 well like less than two of well in general 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.960
 then I think that too bad threads 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.360
 they remain straight considerably 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.650
 much cheaper maybe somewhere 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.479
 then instead of others you can 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.960
 uses those that were 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.960
 for this is the color map 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:31.620
 this gamma 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:36.690
 there are a lot of them here somewhere 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.139
 600 colors are made in the same way 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.289
 there is the same thread cutting 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:46.860
 the only difference is that tms strings 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:50.479
 go cut into 3 threads i.e. 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.490
 Could cutting is divided in half 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.720
 gamma strings here go to full 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.729
 distemper and 6 threads 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.160
 goes cutting here and if necessary I 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:06.419
 I can now attach one strings to 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.599
 others pick the colors I need in that 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:14.789
 or in another embodiment 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:17.550
 Here I am very pleased with so much beauty 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:20.389
 Immediately maybe such things are not necessary for everyone 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.830
 if you only sew by 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.060
 sets 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.490
 probably not really 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.760
 necessary if you still plan 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.909
 I want to embroider something 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.720
 sometimes save picking up from already 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:41.010
 available residues at home or pick up 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.159
 The strings are cheaper, in principle, well, not 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.310
 considering the thing necessary for those who 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:51.720
 keen on embroidery nothing they can still 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:54.000
 need strings well for example recently 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:59.330
 on the floor tag inspiration and desire 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:05.229
 make shooting the easiest to try 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:08.810
 program potter maker I did shemku 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:11.449
 I realized that if there is 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.090
 the desire to make sure the availability of the scheme 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.800
 a lively color map makes it very easy 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.530
 task because i'm very much 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.479
 doubted 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.740
 calves then I picked up although shemka was 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:26.680
 simple enough 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.969
 Nevertheless, doubts tormented me greatly 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.599
 because what we see on the screen 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:32.060
 monitors 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:33.530
 it does not always correspond 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.560
 enemy reality is not always 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:40.879
 corresponds to the monitor everyone has customized 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.280
 different brightness and color 

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:46.030
 all this is very different therefore 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.219
 pick something up on the monitor 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.039
 but think it's just a lottery lucky not 

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:54.050
 lucky here is an option for me 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:58.699
 turned out to be two times cheaper as a menu I 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:08:01.460
 I think than if I bought branded 

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:06.580
 color cards under the video leave a reference 

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:10.159
 where I bought at cost find out from 

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:13.460
 a girl who is engaged in it because 

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:14.740
 that links us with the course price it is believing 

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.430
 lice change 

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.430
 all the best for now
