this is 85 millimeters thick waves are

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.549 
this is 85 millimeters thick waves are
in<00:01:00.429> about<00:01:00.760> just<00:01:01.239> over<00:01:01.389> two<00:01:01.629> kilograms<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:02.440> it's

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
in about just over two kilograms so it's

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.180

quite heavy and too attached I really

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.520 
quite heavy and too attached I really
needed<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:07.050> beef<00:01:08.050> up<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.710> supports<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.880> have

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
needed to beef up the supports so I have

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.400 
needed to beef up the supports so I have
240<00:01:11.530> millimeters<00:01:12.300> wide<00:01:13.300> forming<00:01:14.200> them<00:01:14.320> into

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
back panel though that's the reason why

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.380 
back panel though that's the reason why
I<00:02:50.620> needed<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.980> countersunk<00:02:52.709> otherwise<00:02:53.709> I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
I needed to countersunk otherwise I

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.280 
I needed to countersunk otherwise I
would<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.420> had<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.840> cut<00:02:56.019> into<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
would have had to have cut into the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
would have had to have cut into the
motherboard<00:02:56.709> tray<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.130> just

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
motherboard tray and it's just

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.810 
motherboard tray and it's just
unnecessary<00:02:57.610> work<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.640> give

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
unnecessary work and then to give

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.699 
unnecessary work and then to give
further<00:03:04.120> support<00:03:04.600> I've<00:03:04.780> actually<00:03:04.959> added<00:03:05.410> in

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
further support I've actually added in

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.850

such<00:03:41.580> as<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.569> think<00:03:43.050> BitFenix<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
such as I think BitFenix and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.059 
such as I think BitFenix and
coolermaster<00:03:46.470> actually<00:03:46.800> have<00:03:46.920> those

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
coolermaster actually have those

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.089 
coolermaster actually have those
measurements<00:03:50.750> also<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.900> something<00:03:52.470> worthy<00:03:52.650> to

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
measurements also in something worthy to

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.460 
measurements also in something worthy to
note<00:03:53.129> is<00:03:53.580> that<00:03:53.640> there<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.180> more<00:03:54.480> silver

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
note is that there are more silver

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.770

painted everything black here on the

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.820 
painted everything black here on the
front<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:07.470> well<00:04:08.540> as<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.720> can<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.110> everything

is<00:04:11.010> black<00:04:14.360> I'm<00:04:15.360> at<00:04:15.540> this<00:04:15.690> area<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.290> don't

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
is black I'm at this area you don't

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.400 
is black I'm at this area you don't
actually<00:04:16.650> look<00:04:17.070> at<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.410> know

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
actually look at that you know I know

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.949 
actually look at that you know I know
that<00:04:20.040> it's<00:04:20.160> silver<00:04:20.579> or<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:21.209> it's<00:04:21.359> black<00:04:21.600> and

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that it's silver or that it's black and

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080 
that it's silver or that it's black and
that's<00:04:22.169> what<00:04:22.410> will<00:04:22.530> bug<00:04:22.710> me<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.370> think<00:04:23.940> that

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
that's what will bug me so I think that

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.480 
that's what will bug me so I think that
might<00:04:24.240> have<00:04:24.389> some<00:04:24.630> kind<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.990> us<00:04:31.190> here<00:04:32.190> on<00:04:32.370> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
might have some kind of us here on the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.520 
might have some kind of us here on the
back<00:04:32.700> as<00:04:32.910> well<00:04:33.979> once<00:04:34.979> again<00:04:36.289> everything<00:04:37.289> in

black<00:04:39.169> for<00:04:40.169> these<00:04:40.380> particular<00:04:41.930> screws<00:04:42.930> I'm

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
black for these particular screws I'm

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.659 
black for these particular screws I'm
not<00:04:43.350> sure<00:04:43.530> if<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.740> can<00:04:43.889> see<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:44.550> this
