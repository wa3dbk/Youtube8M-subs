solves<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.500> these<00:00:55.710> stickers<00:00:56.039> there<00:00:56.820> have

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

been virtually no chipping whatsoever

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
been virtually no chipping whatsoever
this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.059> partly<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.870> fitting<00:01:01.289> for

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this is partly because I'm fitting for

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
this is partly because I'm fitting for
this<00:01:01.559> cube<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.460> allows<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> slightly<00:01:03.329> larger

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this cube which allows a slightly larger

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
this cube which allows a slightly larger
margin<00:01:04.350> between<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> edge<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> pieces

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
margin between the edge of the pieces

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.600 
margin between the edge of the pieces
and<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.570> actual<00:01:06.869> stickers<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.430> also

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and the actual stickers and it's also

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
and the actual stickers and it's also
partly<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.780> high<00:01:09.930> quality<00:01:10.200> vinyl

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
partly because of the high quality vinyl

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.310 
partly because of the high quality vinyl
the<00:01:11.610> only<00:01:11.820> problem<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the only problem that I see is that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
the only problem that I see is that
there<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:14.040> tiny<00:01:14.280> air<00:01:14.549> bubbles<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
there are some tiny air bubbles which is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
there are some tiny air bubbles which is
my<00:01:15.960> fault<00:01:16.259> from<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.070> securing<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
my fault from when I was securing this

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
my fault from when I was securing this
cube<00:01:18.259> fortunately<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.710> unnoticeable

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
shades of these stickers as they are all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
shades of these stickers as they are all
bright<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.250> distinguishable<00:01:27.180> between<00:01:27.780> each

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
bright and distinguishable between each

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770 
bright and distinguishable between each
other<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.130> exception<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.119> red<00:01:30.360> which

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
other the one exception is the red which

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.420 
other the one exception is the red which
may<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.439> darker<00:01:31.920> than<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.369> like

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
may be a little darker than I would like

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.940 
may be a little darker than I would like
but<00:01:33.270> overall<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.930> groans<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.890> well

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
but overall up groans like that as well

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.460 
but overall up groans like that as well
I<00:01:35.490> believe<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:36.600> may<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.990> brighter<00:01:37.350> red

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I believe there may be a brighter red

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490 
I believe there may be a brighter red
coming<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> near<00:01:38.790> future<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> overall
