00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.919
 Yes people like that break a d and today we wanted you one again 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.010
 cool they introduce the action and that is the program Android Logar 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.079
 all stand together costs 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.529
 4 dollars to win 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.050
 shows us what then shows when revealing is this little partner down 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.239
 So not necessarily but this Battaini down the Lahn Percent Urban 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.300
 Doktores 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.640
 and maybe he's one known from Android around in Yemen percent 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.460
 then in the stomach you probably quite nice Terni stuck 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 so Berschauer way he here now Euro SID 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 he also appears in the whole he so 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.440
 really very cool vendor all Lippi in the milk for example a lot of minutes though 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 has on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.830
 around the op 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.220
 Percent 3 dollars costs the percent since the war 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.479
 and then 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.349
 there will also come a lot and that will be even the Barten 

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:59.349
 can feel everywhere later on later 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.269
 we were percent 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.860
 at the honor point more heads honored as for example music 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.210
 then the partner will still be there 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.620
 Percent advertised at the wedding so now everything will come 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.540
 it will be many more gray and everything 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.050
 and I think it's pretty good, too, if the man is kneeling, for example 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.050
 starts 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.390
 and then Youngster Storl Schalke yes wrenches on 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.360
 shepherd 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 Heiner MÃ¼ller 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 especially in the chalk 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.900
 Unica to top it up 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.140
 the next song 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 or is it going to do it all the way? 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.750
 yes the program costs Theodor as I said in the synonymous gets none 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.180
 Position on this 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.900
 Hunt leader bruised 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.100
 In addition, there is still attitude to it and in the hand when the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.890
 Setting the Four School of Tablets Android Lola 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.220
 set under you Gadahn specially shortened to Alter Berg processor 10+ o'clock 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 in the morning and so on 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 and second single from today it is quite easy if only percent prepare 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 has hidden 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.140
 for example in the SBZ left or what I for program 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.720
 Could be club Cheltenham be a pleasure 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.650
 so here then reproduced 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.839
 with which we hid on it and everything 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.919
 For me actually very nice then you do not have all at a glance 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.509
 Yanukovych 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:27.909
 To make Erwin Feith Bastian man acrobatics is the whole sort of sorting 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.819
 it's just down there, too 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.410
 it's not sorted by Penn's name but by Bandelow's theme 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.569
 in which deep Trier Cameron was pronounced 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.859
 So that's not exactly sorted by ECDC 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.569
 some of the place is quite easy 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.679
 when you turn it around 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.039
 opened with a program of it 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.269
 so noted for example 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.279
 that the program is back to money 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.079
 so evaluate 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.969
 sometimes it annoys me too must bring again 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.899
 im in need of land life after what you gave them to jump through 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.649
 and then say paging will be up to speed racing 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.679
 slower so Apres is 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.099
 it's easy 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.599
 since they were learning here 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.579
 that could be voices for example go Winter Backbreaker abbreviated 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.279
 but far 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.079
 and then prompt Bathen Klose's year 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.079
 that just opened the window 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.399
 - 2 Kurth 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.629
 because very easy Kombat 9 percent and then Kitas again high 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.290
 I think it's really nice especially if then later 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.329
 one whose percent and then bounced many Kandemir 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.419
 then it would be a good match for the other teams as well 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.979
 for example, well-being or what do I know 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.059
 In any case, you can then even in the meantime Kart or 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.149
 leave a bare-fined knee two-hour middle part still here 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.709
 that looks a bit nicer then 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.699
 and the wars again we hoped we could have you and 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.399
 then 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.349
 Until next time
