00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
previous game and we see a familiar

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.219 
previous game and we see a familiar
pattern<00:01:09.310> where<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.030> White<00:01:10.210> King<00:01:10.479> now<00:01:10.720> also

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
pattern where the White King now also

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.550 
pattern where the White King now also
becomes<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.970> target<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:15.840> black<00:01:16.840> Lee<00:01:17.229> has<00:01:17.530> a

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
becomes a target so black Lee has a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.580 
becomes a target so black Lee has a
massive<00:01:18.070> lead<00:01:18.430> in<00:01:18.610> development<00:01:19.030> now<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
massive lead in development now and it's

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.740 
massive lead in development now and it's
White's<00:01:20.979> King<00:01:21.310> that's<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.969> real<00:01:22.180> trouble<00:01:22.420> as

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
well so Knightly to chain after why did

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.969
