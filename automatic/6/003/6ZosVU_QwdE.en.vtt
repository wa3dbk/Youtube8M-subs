came visa mama important to judge the
temperature<00:00:21.660> because<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> first

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
temperature because we're the first

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.670 
temperature because we're the first
steps<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.240> peanut<00:00:24.810> brittle<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.410> to

steps to make peanut brittle is to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.370 
steps to make peanut brittle is to
butter<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.029> pot<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> took<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:28.170> butter

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
butter the pot so I took some butter

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.099 
butter the pot so I took some butter
just<00:00:28.730> put<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> butter<00:00:30.000> around<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.480> edges<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just put the butter around the edges of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.780 
just put the butter around the edges of
the<00:00:31.349> pot<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.800> also<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> bottom<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.139 
the pot and also on the bottom of the
pot<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:33.360> prevents<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.340> sugar<00:00:35.820> from

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
pot then prevents the the sugar from

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
up to 295 the hard crack stage have my

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.709 
up to 295 the hard crack stage have my
glasses<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.269> could<00:02:27.329> read<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
to the what we call the hard crack stage

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.099 
to the what we call the hard crack stage
which<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.129> 290<00:02:32.790> 300<00:02:34.159> we<00:02:35.159> added<00:02:35.639> the<00:02:36.109> macadamia

teaspoons of baking soda let's head to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.990 
teaspoons of baking soda let's head to
99<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:03.510> 90<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:05.010> off<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.489> comes<00:03:05.760> into

99 to 90 now so off that comes into
water<00:03:06.799> off<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.859> heat<00:03:08.579> then<00:03:10.699> with<00:03:11.699> this

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
water off the heat then with this

stirrer sprinkle the baking soda it's an
alkaline<00:03:20.419> it<00:03:21.419> also<00:03:21.680> sets<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.919> as<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.519> see

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
the baking soda also gives a little

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.490 
the baking soda also gives a little
leavening<00:03:28.889> and<00:03:29.069> texture<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:33.180> mixture<00:03:33.540> and
