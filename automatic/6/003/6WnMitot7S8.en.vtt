 of course likes a warm atmosphere but not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.039
 direct sunlight and when too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.920
 hot you, too, the leaves look sluggish 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.480
 so you need to spray them and water 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.120

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 geranium is more likely to suffer drying than 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.229
 overmoistening though of course tighten 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.320

 leafy plants are not hull and and straight 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.419
 the sun's rays make their leaves so 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.320
 how was walking me 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:26.729
 watering should be moderate not flood 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.600
 no way since the plant immediately 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.990
 same will rot this plant can

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.260
 pour when landing of course while 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.990
