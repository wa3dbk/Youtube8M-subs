 and if there was a vehicle that is the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 benefits of a standard automobile but 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.700
 without having the limits 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 a vehicle that has the capabilities of a

 able to ride in conditions 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.220
 difficult where standard cars 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.220
 quickly find their limits

 what vehicle bought for use all

 some journeys have obstacles 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.930
 unpredictable suspension is designed 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.730
 to answer all 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.220
 driver requests without 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.040
 engender dangerous behavior of the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.040
 vehicle for passengers comfort 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.860
 maximum is maintained especially in the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.570
 ride frame or use in any 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.570
 way can last several hours 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.539
 of course the comfort of driving does not 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.659
 must not forget the difficulties 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.939
 of the ground on bad coating the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.280
 driver must evaluate his speed and 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.450
 adapt his behavior to preserve his 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.459
 vehicle 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.810
 increased ground clearance allows the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.540
 vehicle to ride in paths 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.370
 shattered by avoiding obstacles that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.330
 strew the ground 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.470
 but in the borderline cases where the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.300
 ruts are deep 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 the lower protections plays the role 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.680
 the vehicle can then slide 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.510
 on the stomach without damaging 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.930
 mechanical parts such as crankcase 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.880
 oil or fuel piping with 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.670
 the traction power of the differential to 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.709
 limited slip and faen suspension 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.330
 enhance the lower protections 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.280
 combined with engine performance 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.720
 allows the car to confront 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.720
 barriers unusual 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.210
 that one of the two driving wheels is 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.730
 relieve or even take off from the ground 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.840
 the vehicle equipped with the differential 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.390
 limited slip progresses 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.640
 without this device the wheel in the void 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.730
 would become crazy and the car would not 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.650
 could more advanced tires 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.840
 specialities strengthen the capacity 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 traction wheel drive even in 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.500
 where the nature of the land would be 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.019
 different from one wheel to another 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.489
 the profile of the tire increases the 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.489
 motor skills in any way 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.810
 the whole way to constraints that the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.939
 driver must learn how to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.689
 the difference with the all terrain that 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.579
 imposes another style of vehicles in 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.470
 some extreme situations the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.299
 enhanced motor skills reserve good 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.489
 surprises as to its resources 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.519
 finally this system allows you to confront 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.569
 all weather conditions 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.150
 add to that the fact that his 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.280
 use is very simple without 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.319
 special handling and we can 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.870
 then asserted that the principle of 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.390
 enhanced motor skills is the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.819
 solution a lot of use 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 professional or recreational and because 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.620
 that it's the best compromise between the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.769
 standard vehicle is a real 4 4 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.060
 gentlemen the 4 4 attention now he 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.060
 must be reckoned with evra l
