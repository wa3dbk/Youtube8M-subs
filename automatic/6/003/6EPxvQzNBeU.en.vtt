all<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.110> spoke<00:00:01.500> time<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:01.920> went<00:00:02.040> through

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:04.879 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.700 

teleporters<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.270> one<00:00:06.509> spell<00:00:07.379> time<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:07.620> went

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
teleporters this one spell time we went

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.680 
teleporters this one spell time we went
through<00:00:07.890> them<00:00:08.099> now<00:00:08.730> there's<00:00:09.030> two<00:00:09.150> parts<00:00:09.510> so

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
through them now there's two parts so

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.640 
through them now there's two parts so
there<00:00:10.200> are<00:00:10.410> way<00:00:10.740> points<00:00:11.309> which<00:00:12.290> that's<00:00:13.290> where

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
there are way points which that's where

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.880 
there are way points which that's where
you<00:00:13.740> teleport<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.260> go<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
you teleport to so you have to go to the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.609 
you teleport to so you have to go to the
place<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.570> then<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> waypoint

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
place first then make a waypoint

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.630 
place first then make a waypoint
and<00:00:19.850> then<00:00:20.850> make<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> teleport<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> I'll<00:00:23.490> go

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and then make the teleport so I'll go

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.450 
and then make the teleport so I'll go
ahead<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.910> make<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> Waypoint<00:00:24.560> here<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
ahead and make the Waypoint here now it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.769 
ahead and make the Waypoint here now it
looks<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.939> similar<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> Noah<00:00:27.510> but

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
looks like it's similar to Noah but

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.250 
looks like it's similar to Noah but
there's<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> big<00:00:28.170> mineshaft<00:00:28.800> over<00:00:29.010> there<00:00:29.220> oh

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
there's a big mineshaft over there oh

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
there's a big mineshaft over there oh
yeah<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.630> three<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> 5<00:00:35.579> by<00:00:35.610> 5

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
yeah so three I think this is a 5 by 5

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
yeah so three I think this is a 5 by 5
square<00:00:36.390> by<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.719> way<00:00:39.020> like<00:00:40.020> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
square by the way like that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.970 
square by the way like that
then<00:00:41.719> put<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> car<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.590> has<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
then put it in the car now it has to be

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
then put it in the car now it has to be
cobblestone<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.480> least<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:45.870> it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
cobblestone now at least I think it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
cobblestone now at least I think it's
gonna<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.500> cobblestone<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
gonna be cobblestone so it's like that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.069 
gonna be cobblestone so it's like that
and<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.800> hospital<00:00:50.610> time<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and it's like a hospital time with a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
and it's like a hospital time with a
block<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> middle<00:00:53.360> now<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> people<00:00:56.520> don't

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
block in the middle now so people don't

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
block in the middle now so people don't
teleport<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:58.280> Waypoint<00:00:59.629> you<00:01:00.629> get<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.140> use

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
teleport to your Waypoint you get to use

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.730 
teleport to your Waypoint you get to use
signature<00:01:01.920> blocks<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.530 

sorry<00:01:07.520> that's<00:01:07.939> that's<00:01:08.390> mud<00:01:10.060> right<00:01:11.060> anyway<00:01:13.540> so

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
sorry that's that's mud right anyway so

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.320 
sorry that's that's mud right anyway so
yes<00:01:14.689> signatures<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.610> basically<00:01:17.030> a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
yes signatures and this is basically a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.219 
yes signatures and this is basically a
combination<00:01:17.689> of<00:01:18.200> blocks<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.869> I'm<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.080> gonna

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
combination of blocks so I'm just gonna

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.240 
combination of blocks so I'm just gonna
go<00:01:21.470> ahead<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.950> stick<00:01:23.080> those<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.649> that

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
go ahead and stick those in that

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.429 
go ahead and stick those in that
direction<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:28.189> eat

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
direction and eat

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.010 
direction and eat
so<00:01:30.439> that's<00:01:30.619> East<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:31.610> that's<00:01:31.820> East<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:32.450> West

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
so that's East so that's East and West

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.719 
so that's East so that's East and West
this<00:01:33.560> one's<00:01:33.799> East<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:35.030> one's<00:01:35.179> West<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.770> then

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
this one's East that one's West and then

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.359 
this one's East that one's West and then
there's<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.509> these<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.409> here<00:01:39.679> which<00:01:40.220> is

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
there's that these so here which is

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.389 
there's that these so here which is
north<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.819> south<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.470> for<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:42.950> I'll<00:01:43.250> put

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
north and south so for this I'll put

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.480 
north and south so for this I'll put
sand<00:01:43.759> in<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.810> that's<00:01:44.929> my<00:01:45.200> signature<00:01:45.740> now<00:01:46.429> I

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
sand in so that's my signature now I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.059 
sand in so that's my signature now I
hope<00:01:46.789> it's<00:01:47.000> not<00:01:47.119> taking<00:01:47.630> I'll<00:01:48.409> right<00:01:48.740> click<00:01:48.770> on

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
hope it's not taking I'll right click on

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.730 
hope it's not taking I'll right click on
the<00:01:49.130> middle<00:01:49.340> block<00:01:49.810> yep<00:01:50.810> that's<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.289> Waypoint

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
the middle block yep that's it Waypoint

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.620 
the middle block yep that's it Waypoint

idea<00:01:57.409> what<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.590> says<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.720> Waypoint

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
idea what that says and the Waypoint

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.130 
idea what that says and the Waypoint
signature<00:02:00.649> is<00:02:00.799> no<00:02:01.220> longer<00:02:01.459> needed<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.659> we'll

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
signature is no longer needed so we'll

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.800 
signature is no longer needed so we'll
keep<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.560> our<00:02:03.740> head<00:02:04.240> there<00:02:05.240> we'll<00:02:05.569> just

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
keep that in our head there we'll just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.029 
keep that in our head there we'll just
say<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:07.450> sand<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.720> north<00:02:08.989> we'll<00:02:09.649> just<00:02:09.890> say

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
say that sand is north we'll just say

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.320 
say that sand is north we'll just say
that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.050 

and<00:02:14.330> I'm<00:02:14.780> removing<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.940> people

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and I'm removing this so that people

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.780 
and I'm removing this so that people
don't<00:02:17.570> copy<00:02:17.810> my<00:02:17.990> signature<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.800> they<00:02:19.580> can

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
don't copy my signature and they can

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.310 
don't copy my signature and they can
teleport<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.080> very

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
teleport here because this is very

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.470

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
now I'll just go to spawn now let's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.770 
now I'll just go to spawn now let's
dream<00:02:33.410> craft<00:02:33.740> if<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.700> haven't<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.510> heard<00:02:35.660> you

dream craft if you haven't I heard you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.180 
dream craft if you haven't I heard you
noticed<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.470> should<00:02:36.770> come<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:36.980> blow

but some stolen almost no nice not cool
the<00:02:48.620> ice<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:52.490> that's<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> Waypoint<00:02:53.360> now

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
the ice and so that's the Waypoint now

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.190 
the ice and so that's the Waypoint now
we're<00:02:53.990> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.260> build<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.800> teleporter<00:02:55.370> and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
we're going to build the teleporter and

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.520 
we're going to build the teleporter and
this<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.830> five<00:02:58.310> by<00:02:58.490> five<00:02:58.520> square<00:02:59.030> again<00:02:59.530> two

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
this is a five by five square again two

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.960 
this is a five by five square again two
three<00:03:00.980> four<00:03:01.520> five<00:03:02.290> leave<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> gap<00:03:03.620> one<00:03:04.370> two

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
three four five leave the gap one two

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.120 
three four five leave the gap one two
three<00:03:05.540> four<00:03:06.140> five<00:03:06.710> like<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:08.320> then<00:03:09.320> one<00:03:09.860> block

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
three four five like that then one block

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.490 
three four five like that then one block
in<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.610> then<00:03:11.570> in<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> middle<00:03:11.960> leave<00:03:12.320> that

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.610 
in and then in the middle leave that
blank<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.780> then<00:03:15.440> put

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
blank so it's like that and then put

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.330 
blank so it's like that and then put
spikes<00:03:15.890> on<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.460> like<00:03:19.610> that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
spikes on it so it's like that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.250 
spikes on it so it's like that
hang<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.090> it's<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:25.020> now<00:03:26.020> if<00:03:26.170> you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
wondering how I'm doing that I'm
pressing<00:03:27.700> f1<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.250> now<00:03:30.819> we<00:03:30.910> need<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.120> put<00:03:31.270> our

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
pressing f1 so now we need to put our

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.530 
pressing f1 so now we need to put our
signature<00:03:31.930> box<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:33.989> if<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.200> type<00:03:35.380> compass

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
signature box in and if I type compass

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.809 
signature box in and if I type compass
I'm<00:03:37.540> facing<00:03:37.840> north<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.620> we<00:03:39.099> said<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.550> Sun

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
I'm facing north and we said that Sun

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.870 
I'm facing north and we said that Sun
does<00:03:40.060> not<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.860> we'll<00:03:42.010> put<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.400> north<00:03:42.640> and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
does not so we'll put that in north and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.670 
does not so we'll put that in north and
south<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:44.610> we'll<00:03:45.610> fill<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:45.940> rest<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.680> Inwood

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
south and we'll fill the rest in Inwood

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.600 
south and we'll fill the rest in Inwood
because<00:03:48.610> that's<00:03:48.819> our<00:03:49.000> signature<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:50.610> we'll

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
because that's our signature and we'll

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.270 
because that's our signature and we'll
put<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.819> cobblestone<00:03:52.209> block<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> middle

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
put a cobblestone block in the middle

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.850 
put a cobblestone block in the middle
and<00:03:54.280> we'll<00:03:54.400> right-click<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.860> nothing's
