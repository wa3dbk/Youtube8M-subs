in<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.209> documentary<00:02:15.540> format<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:17.010> couldn't<00:02:17.280> tell

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
in a documentary format we couldn't tell

people to stop and to redo things we had

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.310 
people to stop and to redo things we had
to<00:02:20.820> work<00:02:20.970> around<00:02:21.150> them<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> important

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
to work around them so the important

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.290 
to work around them so the important
thing<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.620> being<00:02:22.890> very<00:02:23.070> fast<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.819> agile<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
thing is being very fast and agile and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
thing is being very fast and agile and
being<00:02:25.200> able<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> reposition<00:02:25.770> quickly<00:02:26.520> and

being able to reposition quickly and
work<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> would<00:02:28.200> when<00:02:28.380> you're

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
work just as you would when you're

filming any other documentary a lot of
the<00:02:30.870> time<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> ability<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
extensively light what you're working on

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.020 
extensively light what you're working on
this<00:02:34.980> meant<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.340> there<00:02:35.670> are<00:02:35.730> only<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.970> few

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
this meant that there are only a few

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.729 
this meant that there are only a few
occasions<00:02:36.720> where<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:36.989> could<00:02:37.110> bring<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.500> lights

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
occasions where we could bring in lights

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.100 
occasions where we could bring in lights
but<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> majority<00:02:38.820> at<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.269> time<00:02:39.510> we're<00:02:39.810> really

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
but a majority at a time we're really

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.110 
but a majority at a time we're really
trying<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.560> work<00:02:40.800> with<00:02:41.010> combination<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
trying to work with combination is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.670 
trying to work with combination is
available<00:02:42.630> practical<00:02:43.140> light<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> room

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
available practical light in the room

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.490 
available practical light in the room
and<00:02:44.370> also<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.269> small<00:02:45.600> amount<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.050> light<00:02:46.260> we

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
and also just a small amount of light we

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.449 
and also just a small amount of light we
could<00:02:46.650> add<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:48.000> camera<00:02:48.330> does<00:02:48.590> amazing<00:02:49.590> 1080p

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
could add this camera does amazing 1080p

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.830 
could add this camera does amazing 1080p
it's<00:02:51.000> beautiful<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:53.300> also<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.510> because

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it's beautiful and and also it because

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.690 
it's beautiful and and also it because
porky<00:02:55.380> internally<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.070> that's<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.519> thing

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
porky internally and that's the thing

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.180 
porky internally and that's the thing
that<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.540> gives<00:02:57.930> us<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.350> edge<00:02:58.829> with<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that I think gives us the edge with this

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.340 
that I think gives us the edge with this
camcorder<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> ability<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.600> recording

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
camcorder is the ability to recording

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.740 
camcorder is the ability to recording
the<00:03:01.440> XQD<00:03:01.950> card<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:03.000> key<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.329> tunnel<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the XQD card for key and tunnel and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110 
the XQD card for key and tunnel and
1080p<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.680> there's<00:03:05.190> really<00:03:05.340> no<00:03:05.579> reason<00:03:05.760> why

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
1080p so there's really no reason why

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.490 
1080p so there's really no reason why
you<00:03:06.150> can't<00:03:06.570> acquire<00:03:07.049> 4k<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:09.049> create<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> 1080p

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
you can't acquire 4k and create a 1080p

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.819 
you can't acquire 4k and create a 1080p
master<00:03:11.510> when<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.900> thought<00:03:13.200> closer

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
master when then and I thought closer

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.069 
master when then and I thought closer
about<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.370> sort<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.640> narrative<00:03:14.880> format<00:03:15.510> we

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
about the sort of narrative format we

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.699 
about the sort of narrative format we
should<00:03:16.290> use<00:03:16.920> for<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> FS<00:03:17.610> 7<00:03:18.030> film<00:03:18.440> we<00:03:19.440> really

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
should use for the FS 7 film we really

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.259 
should use for the FS 7 film we really
wanted<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.310> across<00:03:20.459> something<00:03:21.090> which

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
wanted to get across something which

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.830 
wanted to get across something which
should<00:03:21.709> allow<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.010> viewer<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.519> watch<00:03:24.360> every

should allow the viewer to watch every

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.660 
should allow the viewer to watch every
