00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
of room in the bench you'd hardly ever

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
see this in an NHL game today would you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.860 
see this in an NHL game today would you
do<00:03:23.640> many<00:03:23.820> penalties<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.270> leaving<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.720> bench

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
and stuff like that Valli leave the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.530 
and stuff like that Valli leave the
bench<00:03:26.910> yes<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:28.520> hate<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.700> say<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.060> but<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.330> think

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
bench yes I hate to say this but I think

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.790 
bench yes I hate to say this but I think
in<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.690> way<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:30.870> need<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.470> bit<00:03:31.650> of

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
in a way we need a little bit of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.820 
in a way we need a little bit of
intensity<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:33.480> draw<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.260> kind<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.650> there's

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
intensity to draw that kind of there's

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.410 
intensity to draw that kind of there's
when<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.489> listen<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.910> buildings<00:03:36.270> when

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
when you listen to buildings when

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.820 
when you listen to buildings when
there's<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.630> good<00:03:36.870> good<00:03:37.200> fight<00:03:37.470> going<00:03:37.650> on

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
there's a good good fight going on

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.770 
there's a good good fight going on
generally<00:03:38.130> speaking<00:03:38.700> people<00:03:38.910> don't<00:03:39.540> really

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
generally speaking people don't really

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.110 
generally speaking people don't really
get<00:03:39.900> hurt<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.500> real<00:03:40.709> nasty<00:03:41.459> fight<00:03:41.910> it's

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
get hurt and in real nasty fight it's

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.150 
get hurt and in real nasty fight it's
it's<00:03:42.930> Jenny<00:03:43.290> guy<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.709> de<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.980> guy<00:03:44.100> you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
it's Jenny guy in de and the guy you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.830 
it's Jenny guy in de and the guy you
might<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.580> little<00:03:44.700> cut<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.180> whatever<00:03:45.390> but

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
might get a little cut or whatever but

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.340 
might get a little cut or whatever but
what<00:03:46.320> what<00:03:46.680> what<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.640> what<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.750> really<00:03:49.200> be

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
what what what can what can really be

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.520 
what what what can what can really be
done<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:50.390> stick<00:03:51.390> damage<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.049> all<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
done is stick damage and all that and I

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.020 
done is stick damage and all that and I
think<00:03:52.590> when<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> lot<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.489> stick<00:03:53.790> work

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
think when you have a lot of stick work

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.390 
think when you have a lot of stick work
and<00:03:54.330> Michelle<00:03:55.110> Sammy's<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> big<00:03:55.860> grin<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.160> his

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
and Michelle Sammy's a big grin on his

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.310 
and Michelle Sammy's a big grin on his
face<00:03:56.459> when<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.660> lot<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.870> stick<00:03:58.140> work

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
face when you have a lot of stick work

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.630 
face when you have a lot of stick work
out<00:03:58.500> there<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.709> think<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.040> interest<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.519> be

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
out there I think the interest can be

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.370 
out there I think the interest can be
more<00:03:59.820> severe<00:04:00.120> or<00:04:00.180> guys<00:04:00.510> going<00:04:00.870> after<00:04:01.019> knees

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
more severe or guys going after knees

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.289 
more severe or guys going after knees
and<00:04:01.769> somehow<00:04:02.220> along<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.580> way<00:04:02.790> you've<00:04:03.000> got<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
and somehow along the way you've got to

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.449 
and somehow along the way you've got to
protect<00:04:03.600> your<00:04:03.780> teammates<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.709> think<00:04:05.340> at

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
protect your teammates and I think at

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.310 
protect your teammates and I think at
times<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:06.239> rules<00:04:06.450> don't<00:04:06.660> allow<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.170> do

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
times the rules don't allow you to do

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.870 
times the rules don't allow you to do
that<00:04:07.530> because<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.130> instigation<00:04:08.549> rule

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
that because of the instigation rule

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.120 
that because of the instigation rule
things<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.959> I'd<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.950> see<00:04:11.100> a

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
things like that so I I'd like to see a

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.680 
things like that so I I'd like to see a
little<00:04:11.310> bit<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.730> come<00:04:11.970> back<00:04:12.180> because<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
little bit of that come back because the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.920 
little bit of that come back because the
intensity<00:04:13.170> level<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.590> there
