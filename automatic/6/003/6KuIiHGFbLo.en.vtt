00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
long awaited for years I don't know how

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.870

I<00:04:38.600> personally<00:04:39.139> feel<00:04:39.290> about<00:04:39.560> what<00:04:39.800> he<00:04:39.919> did<00:04:40.130> but

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
I personally feel about what he did but

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.790 
I personally feel about what he did but
maybe<00:04:41.330> it'll<00:04:41.540> play<00:04:41.600> out<00:04:41.840> in<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.169> storyline

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
maybe it'll play out in the storyline

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.860 
maybe it'll play out in the storyline
and<00:04:43.040> it'll<00:04:43.340> make<00:04:43.490> sense<00:04:43.520> later<00:04:43.910> on<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.630> we'll

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
and it'll make sense later on and we'll

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.950 
and it'll make sense later on and we'll
get<00:04:45.020> used<00:04:45.229> to<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.440> but<00:04:45.770> he<00:04:46.490> actually<00:04:46.960> unmasks

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960
