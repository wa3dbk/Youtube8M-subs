Yeti<00:00:04.950> coolers<00:00:05.340> we're<00:00:06.150> here<00:00:06.299> talking<00:00:06.480> about

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
Yeti coolers we're here talking about

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.390 
Yeti coolers we're here talking about
the<00:00:07.020> Yeti<00:00:07.440> hopper<00:00:07.980> here<00:00:08.219> at<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.570> bar<00:00:09.920> demo<00:00:10.920> day

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the Yeti hopper here at the bar demo day

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
the Yeti hopper here at the bar demo day
so<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> Yeti<00:00:12.090> hopper<00:00:12.510> came<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:12.900> last<00:00:13.050> year

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
so the Yeti hopper came out last year

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.740 
so the Yeti hopper came out last year
was<00:00:13.590> our<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:13.769> size<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> hopper<00:00:14.940> 30<00:00:15.240> this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
was our first size of the hopper 30 this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.359 
was our first size of the hopper 30 this
is<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.990> smaller<00:00:16.349> size<00:00:16.439> which<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.920> came<00:00:17.099> out<00:00:17.250> with

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
is a smaller size which we came out with

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.420 
is a smaller size which we came out with
this<00:00:17.490> spring<00:00:17.760> plus<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> hopper<00:00:18.630> 20<00:00:19.080> no<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.650> for

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
this spring plus the hopper 20 no so for

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.150 
this spring plus the hopper 20 no so for
years<00:00:20.640> we've<00:00:20.850> made<00:00:21.029> hard<00:00:21.330> sided<00:00:21.570> coolers<00:00:22.160> but

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
years we've made hard sided coolers but

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
years we've made hard sided coolers but
that's<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> stationary<00:00:24.660> cooler<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that's really a stationary cooler that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's really a stationary cooler that
you're<00:00:25.320> gonna<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> beach<00:00:26.100> and<00:00:26.340> be

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
about it is this t zip zipper so this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
about it is this t zip zipper so this
zipper<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:38.130> you'll<00:00:38.250> find<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> hazmat

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
zipper is what you'll find on the hazmat

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660 
zipper is what you'll find on the hazmat
suits<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> survival<00:00:41.070> zipper<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.579> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
suits it's a survival zipper so it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
suits it's a survival zipper so it
doesn't<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.719> completely<00:00:43.379> leak<00:00:43.620> proof<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
doesn't it's completely leak proof and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.569 
doesn't it's completely leak proof and
airtight<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> any<00:00:46.410> ice<00:00:46.680> any<00:00:47.039> liquid<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
airtight so any ice any liquid that you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
airtight so any ice any liquid that you
put<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> thing<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> literally<00:00:48.840> tip

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
put in this thing you can literally tip

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so the zipper is fantastic it's got of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 
so the zipper is fantastic it's got of
insulation<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.910> each<00:00:57.030> side<00:00:57.360> an<00:00:57.930> inch<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
insulation on each side an inch of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
insulation on each side an inch of
closed<00:00:58.590> cell<00:00:58.890> foam<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.579> again<00:00:59.910> SH<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> half

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
closed cell foam and again SH and a half

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
closed cell foam and again SH and a half
of<00:01:00.510> installation<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> bottom<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
of installation on the bottom and that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
of installation on the bottom and that
closed<00:01:02.309> cell<00:01:02.520> foam<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.910> great<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.359> any

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
closed cell foam is great because any

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.760 
closed cell foam is great because any
moisture<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.989> gets<00:01:04.259> in<00:01:04.410> there<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.649> gonna

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
moisture that gets in there it's gonna

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.080 
moisture that gets in there it's gonna
reject<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
reject it so it's not going to be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.750 
reject it so it's not going to be
absorbed<00:01:06.210> by<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> pool<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.610> these

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
absorbed by the pool and then these

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.539 
absorbed by the pool and then these
sides<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.439> welded<00:01:10.710> seams<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
sides here have welded seams so it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.100 
sides here have welded seams so it's
very<00:01:11.760> similar<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.240> you'll<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.930> on

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
very similar to what you'll see on on

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.740 
very similar to what you'll see on on
really<00:01:13.890> tough<00:01:14.310> durable<00:01:14.729> waders<00:01:15.240> maybe<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
really tough durable waders maybe in the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
really tough durable waders maybe in the
fly-fishing<00:01:16.200> community<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.640> preaches

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
fly-fishing community but this preaches

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.980 
fly-fishing community but this preaches
the<00:01:18.630> same<00:01:19.670> same<00:01:20.670> durability<00:01:21.060> factor<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.869> our

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the same same durability factor that our

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
the same same durability factor that our
hard<00:01:22.200> static<00:01:22.470> coolers<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> still

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
hard static coolers have and it still

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.240 
hard static coolers have and it still
has<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> ice<00:01:24.060> retention<00:01:24.600> capabilities<00:01:25.250> I've

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
has the ice retention capabilities I've

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.480 
has the ice retention capabilities I've
used<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:27.090> full<00:01:27.500> full<00:01:28.500> range<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.189> day

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
used it it has full full range of a day

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
used it it has full full range of a day
full<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> ice<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.390> you're<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> beach<00:01:30.990> it

full of ice if you're on the beach it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.350 
full of ice if you're on the beach it
also<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.369> capability<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.060> longer

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
also has the capability to go longer

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
also has the capability to go longer
