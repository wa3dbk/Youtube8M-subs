00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
because as the case I've just cited they

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.330 
because as the case I've just cited they
are<00:03:55.750> not<00:03:55.959> alone<00:03:56.350> there<00:03:56.650> are<00:03:56.709> many<00:03:57.070> young

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
people do things like this and even if

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.100 
people do things like this and even if
they<00:04:00.970> don't

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
they don't

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.979 
they don't
we've<00:04:02.830> only<00:04:03.010> got<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.519> look<00:04:03.730> around<00:04:03.880> YouTube<00:04:04.660> to

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
we've only got to look around YouTube to

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.820 
we've only got to look around YouTube to
see<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.410> value<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:06.070> young<00:04:06.310> people<00:04:06.820> how<00:04:07.060> much

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
see the value of young people how much

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.619 
see the value of young people how much
ability<00:04:08.830> they<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.370> how<00:04:09.910> much<00:04:10.120> fun<00:04:10.510> they<00:04:10.780> have

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.569 

there<00:04:14.629> they're<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.290> nice<00:04:15.530> ordinary<00:04:16.160> people

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
there they're just nice ordinary people

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.000 
there they're just nice ordinary people
and<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.090> they<00:04:17.299> are<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.900> course<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.530> norm

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
and and they are of course the norm

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.230 
and and they are of course the norm
I'm<00:04:19.489> sure<00:04:19.820> there's<00:04:20.120> far<00:04:20.419> more<00:04:21.370> old<00:04:22.370> people<00:04:23.030> who

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
I'm sure there's far more old people who

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.450 
I'm sure there's far more old people who
misbehave<00:04:23.930> than<00:04:24.260> young<00:04:24.530> people<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.250> young

III don't know but it's just an example

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.480 
III don't know but it's just an example
I<00:05:22.550> think<00:05:22.610> of<00:05:23.150> of<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.260> goodness<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.979> the

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
I think of of the goodness of the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.600 
I think of of the goodness of the
goodness<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:26.090> youth<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:27.680> course<00:05:30.610> that's

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
goodness of youth and of course that's

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.089 
goodness of youth and of course that's
my<00:05:31.970> opinion<00:05:32.270> really<00:05:32.660> um<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.440> haven't<00:05:33.800> plotted

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
my opinion really um I haven't plotted

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.010 
my opinion really um I haven't plotted
this<00:05:34.490> very<00:05:34.760> well<00:05:35.030> have<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.510> make<00:05:35.810> an

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
this very well have I to make an

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.839 
this very well have I to make an
argument<00:05:36.590> but<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:36.860> think<00:05:37.280> you<00:05:37.400> know<00:05:37.610> what<00:05:37.820> I

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
argument but I think you know what I

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:38.440 
argument but I think you know what I
mean

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
mean

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.219 
mean
and<00:05:41.020> so<00:05:42.020> let's<00:05:42.919> leave<00:05:43.400> it<00:05:43.580> there<00:05:43.789> and<00:05:44.229> that's

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
and so let's leave it there and that's

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.270 
and so let's leave it there and that's
my<00:05:45.500> opinion<00:05:46.099> and<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:48.139> young<00:05:48.650> people<00:05:48.860> are

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
my opinion and the young people are

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.279 
my opinion and the young people are
going<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.639> be<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.910> people<00:05:50.330> who<00:05:50.360> are<00:05:50.870> going<00:05:51.139> to

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
going to be the people who are going to

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.620 
going to be the people who are going to
be<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.770> scientists<00:05:52.520> and<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.760> doctors<00:05:52.789> and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
be the scientists and the doctors and

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.490 
be the scientists and the doctors and
the<00:05:54.880> politicians<00:05:55.880> of<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.479> future<00:05:56.990> who<00:05:57.200> are

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
the politicians of the future who are

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.350 
the politicians of the future who are
going<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:58.930> manage<00:05:59.930> all<00:06:00.349> of<00:06:00.620> us<00:06:00.770> old<00:06:01.220> people<00:06:01.460> so

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
going to manage all of us old people so

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.440 
going to manage all of us old people so
I<00:06:02.660> think<00:06:02.960> we<00:06:03.470> should<00:06:03.770> give<00:06:03.979> them<00:06:04.280> great<00:06:04.910> credit

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
I think we should give them great credit

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.439 
I think we should give them great credit
for<00:06:05.720> their<00:06:05.900> abilities<00:06:06.590> and<00:06:06.919> all<00:06:07.700> right<00:06:08.150> there

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
for their abilities and all right there

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.260 
for their abilities and all right there
will<00:06:08.599> always<00:06:08.780> be<00:06:09.199> a<00:06:09.229> few<00:06:09.680> who<00:06:10.099> are<00:06:10.430> beyond<00:06:10.910> hope

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
will always be a few who are beyond hope

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.020 
will always be a few who are beyond hope
but<00:06:11.660> they're<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:12.380> very<00:06:12.919> very<00:06:13.280> small<00:06:13.669> minority

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
but they're a very very small minority

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.730 
but they're a very very small minority
and<00:06:15.010> my<00:06:16.010> hopes<00:06:16.310> for<00:06:16.639> the<00:06:16.729> future

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740
