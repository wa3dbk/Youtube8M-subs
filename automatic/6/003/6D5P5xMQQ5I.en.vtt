00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.930
 no no 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.750
 hello guys and girls that kind of like 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.160
 tour and good here this a new video and 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.350
 in this case I will open 100 thousand 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.029
 coins for the team of the week that 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.699
 it just came out what should have 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.430
 come out here we have it with just to 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.810
 7 o'clock in the afternoon and it should have gone 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.059
 and here we have it the truth is that I'm going to 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.379
 take a look at it because neither 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.789
 had seen very well the truth is that 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.289
 there are a lot of silvers that interest me 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.839
 in principle, we have a Christian 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.069
 ronaldo de makoun interests me a lot 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.749
 because he is a player that I already liked 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:45.969
 last year and well I think that I 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.109
 You may like me I also 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.909
 player that interests me very much but 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.199
 I think it will be carillo after 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.019
 silver on the bench as you see the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.969
 Nobodies looks very good but 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.469
 what a good look the player is 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.299
 quite interesting is the world is this 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.190
 It is very expensive, probably because it has 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.539
 pretty rhythm and good shot I do not know there 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.969
 many interesting pictures that the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.199
 truth is that I could be interested and 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.880
 well let's see if we have a bit of 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.880
 loose so we're not going to open 100 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.409
 and let's see if we need it, we have 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.320
 a little bit of luck, so 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.430
 nothing we're going to go to the envelopes and we're going to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.120
 start there are no envelopes 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.490
 there are not about these specials but not 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.340
 there's so let's start as you see 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.290
 I have 626 25,000 coins so nothing 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.640
 I have to get to 525,000 so nothing 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.280
 we will see that we play the first envelope 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.530
 and the first one we play samoa in this 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.760
 player of the juventus that by the way already 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.430
 I have it so we're going to look at it 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.310
 mallet put the list of transferable the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.140
 america t shirt and good ones 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.210
 contracts always numbers had to be given 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.979
 so well let's send them here the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.360
 training plus 10 I do not know if it will cost 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.450
 a lot so let's send the deck by 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.610
 if perhaps after we have touched muñoz that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.920
 well I'm going to stay total for 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.149
 discard what I keep and we're going to 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.830
 discard the rest let's see if 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.080
 we are lucky the truth is that ya 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.220
 I say that there are enough players 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.869
 silver that interests me so I'm going to 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 open also silver envelopes I'm going to 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.050
 open about 45 after can be the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.729
 method what it is to get out a few 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.020
 of gold after silver to see if we have 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.850
 lucky because the truth is that silver 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.290
 so there are players that interest me and 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.670
 good has played and will see this for the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.270
 grace that is not hands touch and you will see 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.460
 we also had to leave son bic 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.930
 but I'm going to stay because it's a 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.850
 player that I also like the year 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.300
 I was past in life and I already help you 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.040
 to the premier so imagine the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.180
 contracts and let's see here that has 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.850
 touched be saltillo and such but not 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.170
 has only got three watermarks and 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.910
 nothing does not interest us the rest what 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.440
 we discard the moment I can not 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.960
 complain more I'm the first one who has 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.670
 touched to samoa and such and such in this bat 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.390
 every thread so I'm not going to 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.520
 complain and we go there if we touch any 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.410
 of silver because this week of silver well 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.990
 that there are two or three players that I believe 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.370
 which are interesting especially the wells 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.490
 this one that looks like it's pretty 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.520
 expensive because by the average you have 91 of 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.050
 rhythm has 75 of shot can be 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.660
 quite quite expensive has touched us 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.180
 pool 193 fuck then to measure 193 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.730
 care we have touched the birmingham city 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.290
 The shield 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.460
 there is nothing that interests us I'm going to 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.540
 discard everything 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.950
 Normally yes I normally stay the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.240
 German silver juice playing I think that 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.330
 these are pretty bad so I do not 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.180
 I'll stay but never say never know 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.160
 what is said but I do not want me 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.710
 touch the truth the truth is that I do not know 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.320
 if you have more chance of eye host 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.510
 Care has touched us to squares eye 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.930
 care we have been overlooked 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.090
 ported by the pt for the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.620
 one of the league of manager of state and 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.969
 you touch the box again the truth that 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 what a surprise it has taken me when 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.689
 seen like this is I think it 's the first 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.390
 times that has touched me on about everything 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.630
 what I wear when fifa so so 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.930
 good 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.220
 in the beginning I'm going to keep it and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.770
 we will see to see what I do with it this we 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.690
 johnson has touched andújar and Well 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.820
 the rest does not interest us much so 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.200
 let's save the contracts and give now 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.970
 discard good because we have already touched 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.770
 something interesting the truth check me 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.200
 I think it 's about 60,000 coins or 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.210
 something like that so good is already a thing 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.410
 quite interesting in this envelope is 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.230
 pretty good and good I all the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.060
 decoration I'll keep it just in case and 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.630
 good has touched us the already is also 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.940
 touched gamberini gamberini I keep it 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.050
 the day he sent it to the deck because the truth 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.180
 is that I've tried it two or three times 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.800
 has always given him opportunities and such and 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.160
 It has never finished convincing me 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.160
 that good sent it to the deck and it 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.930
 I can take advantage of another else we 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.810
 to keep the envelopes or be the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.490
 contracts and we discard the acts of 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.889
 iturra that I already have it because you ramis a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.870
 Lyon the initial envelope of fifa 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.419
 and I could not sell it or anything like that 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.330
 I do not keep it and it is very tied this 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.919
 year I went to plus it's very small but not 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.509
 you notice the theme that he is the 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.430
 remove easily and I liked that 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.529
 enzo enough already going very well 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.249
 let's see another about to see what we 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:04.800
 touch we go there to see the little witch 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:12.749
 pretty well we have the cone 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:15.889
 arbeloa what remained kings and sergio 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.889
 I would surely kill myself 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.469
 let's catch all the lessons this 

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:24.419
 we are going to look at the deck that bursts me 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.399
 very much because I do not use it the subject 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.129
 to put more 10 attributes to the 

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:31.169
 players and such and I get very confused 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.029
 because when I'm going to apply a contract 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.349
 that's before the contracts and almost 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.419
 I always go in and I have to go out again 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.860
 and such and I lose time so those 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.270
 usually always my thing to the deck what 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.680
 discard directly 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.480
 and the truth is that it fucks me not because 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.220
 you lose time and such we have touched 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.430
 cambiasso 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.150
 the architect did not move to young 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.590
 we are going to send the deck 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.290
 This cool shield is not a weird shield 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.240
 I'm cool getafe portuguese league I keep it 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.650
 all the lessons that I can 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.080
 always be the subject of the leagues of 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.730
 manager, I would just stay since some 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.260
 leagues that it seems that it does not but it costs in 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.260
 veneers good cambiasso I'll keep it 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.080
 let's go there the last one about let's see 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.720
 that touches us 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.319
 we go there exactly the last one we 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.539
 we were in 525,000 stuck right and we 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.490
 touch is moulin is moulin has touched us 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.639
 also rubén that this one plays in the 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.720
 villarreal last year I think we've 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.020
 touched man 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.310
 well it does not look good man is the 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.310
 activation of the val in day 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.160
 the lane manager or side league 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.130
 right does not cost much is mobile and 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.160
 we 're going to look at the deck we're staying 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.200
 the contracts 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.330
 against titles contracts 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.190
 and we discard the others so nothing 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.920
 this has been the pact pending hundreds 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.060
 of hundreds of thousands of ten thousand coins the 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.680
 It's true that I can not complain 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.540
 touched to squares and I have touched some 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.280
 a little something more interesting truth 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.080
 so I can not complain as you see me 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.560
 has touched boxes in moulin law have 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.780
 and see elias I love zz so I do not 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.949
 I can complain and nothing else so nothing
