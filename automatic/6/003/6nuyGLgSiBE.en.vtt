00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.160 
instance I know there is which is why
I've<00:02:51.480> opted<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.900> make<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.079> video<00:02:52.290> about<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:54.170> but

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
I've opted to make a video about it but

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.589 
I've opted to make a video about it but
like<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.440> said<00:02:55.650> my<00:02:56.099> concerns<00:02:56.549> are<00:02:56.909> what<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:57.450> know

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
like I said my concerns are what I know

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.970 
like I said my concerns are what I know
it's<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:57.989> expensive<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.799> means

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
it's going to be expensive so that means

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.960 
it's going to be expensive so that means
that<00:02:59.190> there's<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.609> lot<00:02:59.940> of

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that there's going to be a lot of

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.970 
that there's going to be a lot of
negotiating<00:03:00.750> around<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:02.030> too<00:03:03.030> i<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.269> that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
negotiating around that too i think that

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.839 
negotiating around that too i think that
you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:06.840> there's<00:03:07.440> other<00:03:07.680> clubs<00:03:08.280> which<00:03:08.670> is

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
you know there's other clubs which is

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.839 
you know there's other clubs which is
always<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.180> concern<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:10.799> know<00:03:10.889> because<00:03:11.340> i<00:03:11.489> cap

always a concern you know because i cap

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.270 
always a concern you know because i cap
on<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.750> occasion<00:03:13.290> i<00:03:13.500> think<00:03:13.739> we<00:03:13.859> can<00:03:14.040> match

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
on this occasion i think we can match

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.699 
on this occasion i think we can match
the<00:03:14.489> sort<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.819> money<00:03:15.000> I'm<00:03:15.150> s<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.659> assume<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.530> don't

hundred two hundred you get silly so the

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.210 
hundred two hundred you get silly so the
big<00:03:50.910> concern<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:52.169> that<00:03:52.590> there<00:03:53.190> are

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
big concern really is that there are

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.009 
big concern really is that there are
interested<00:03:53.849> parties<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.690> Liverpool

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
interested parties but Liverpool

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.210 
interested parties but Liverpool
obviously<00:03:55.349> feel<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.680> they've<00:03:55.829> got<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> good

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
obviously feel that they've got a good

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.509 
obviously feel that they've got a good
chance<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.639> doing<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:57.060> real<00:03:57.209> sudden<00:03:58.519> wouldn't

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
chance of doing it real sudden wouldn't

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.979 
chance of doing it real sudden wouldn't
be<00:03:59.609> trying<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:00.449> they<00:04:00.540> wouldn't<00:04:00.720> be<00:04:00.810> trying

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
be trying and so they wouldn't be trying

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.479 
be trying and so they wouldn't be trying
to<00:04:01.079> negotiate<00:04:01.379> something<00:04:01.919> if<00:04:02.099> they<00:04:02.220> didn't
