00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.270
 the curve 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.190
 could happen but only eyes 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.100
 20 less when it rains or you have a 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.940
 little feeling in the first 23 curves 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.720

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.369
 already little profile what in the rain website 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.770
