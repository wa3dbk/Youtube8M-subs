i think it may even be expired like does

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
i think it may even be expired like does
this<00:02:21.959> stuff<00:02:22.200> expire<00:02:22.740> because<00:02:23.130> i'm<00:02:23.459> sure<00:02:23.640> this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
this stuff expire because i'm sure this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.600 
this stuff expire because i'm sure this
is<00:02:24.000> expired<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.380> how<00:02:25.530> much<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.860> flat<00:02:26.400> on

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.190 
is expired but that's how much I flat on
my<00:02:26.700> hair<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.240> even<00:02:27.360> put<00:02:27.750> heat<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:27.959> my<00:02:28.170> hair

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
my hair I don't even put heat on my hair

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.990 
my hair I don't even put heat on my hair
like<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.920> even<00:02:29.190> use<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> whole<00:02:29.819> bottle

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
like that to even use the whole bottle

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
like that to even use the whole bottle
so<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.230> probably<00:02:31.470> gonna<00:02:31.650> last<00:02:31.950> me<00:02:32.130> for
