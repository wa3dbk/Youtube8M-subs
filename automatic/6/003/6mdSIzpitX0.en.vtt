00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.400
 again naughty testing ground 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.090
 today to traditional nines 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.309
 tag we add another five 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.860
 from out of 400 case and I already told 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.860
 now it will be 330 s 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.360
 first and how to check under the tag 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.729
 your ideas 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.960
 but this is a separate conversation and topic for 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.000
 separate film our task is different 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.909
 leave push pull mercury 5 with screw 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 all came a tenths of an inch native screw 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.439
 come along with a motor from belgium and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.539
 see how the boat goes to the lens 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.740
 the camera hit only that chases races 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.720
 when I moved from the bank already to the deck 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.549
 such a stern-loading boat on the straight 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.100
 overclocked to over thirty 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.990
 kilometers per hour due to substantial 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 displacement of the center of gravity in the stern at 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 wave passing 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.439
 quite predictable fluctuations but without 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 Stalling in delphi nirovaniya window 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.049
 instant speed when looked 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.270
 it was not even the bank 30.4 kilometers 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.209
 per hour and mostly speed fluctuated 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.399
 from 29 two to twenty nine 8 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.929
 the boat was perfectly managed without 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.569
 the slightest hint of a side 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:19.410
 slippage with minimum roll 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:21.239
 allowing you to pitch any garages roll in 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.750
 side to one in the circulation just by 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.750
 classics 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.099
 and 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.920
 you can see how well the bottom works 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.350
 does not stick to water at all and without dragging 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.760
 on itself unnecessary weight 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.340
 the boat turned out very salable with 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.410
 excellent handling 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.330
 but smoke 5 a little shorter a day or more minutes 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.750
 are located antique vita tional plate 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.360
 so from under him noticeably spray but 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.580
 the direction of this flow back therefore 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.790
 even coming downwind like drinking nothing 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.610
 flew this size boat fits and 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.260
 for one with a five such a set 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.570
 selfish and for two but then on the transom 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.370
 asking for something from 8 horsepower and 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.910
 above 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.580
 tests completed and smart heads 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.940
 continue to grimace creating new 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.940
 project
