00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 to guys brothers of minecraft from mons io 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.870
 I'm a piece today, I'm here to introduce you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.690
 la de force mod 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.849
 let's start right away but let's see what 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 introduces us this new fashion begins 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 immediately telling you that this fashion is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.330
 still work in progress but for work 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.369
 they are really doing 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 satisfactory we can say then is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.010
 an alternative to the ever wars mode una 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
 valid alternative because I say yes because 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.400
 being by let's say for now yet 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 work in progress is really beautiful 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.260
 mode as we activate lightsaber by pressing 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 r this light beam will be activated 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.040
 we have two swords that of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 of algiers that what is now that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 of the site one of blue and one of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.579
 red color for now have the same 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.010
 effects i mean i'll show you now 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.420
 how to use the effects of these 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.610
 swords and what they do 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.219
 I remember again that I still work 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.199
 in progress and is really beautiful for now 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.840
 there are still few features though 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.239
 from the screenshots of future things that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.129
 will want to do I have to say he is doing a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.140
 good job as we activate the force 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 holding down the right button 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.220
 you see that even the water is hit 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.840
 from this sort of force strength 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 let's say it's marked with lines 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 also that you will find in the table of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.909
 spells you see here are the textures are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 a little paid like those of the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.299
 of objects I mean and what 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.600
 we are doing this with strength in the meantime 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.630
 over the same these swords I must say 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.820
 look, now i practically killed him 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.070
 I'm shooting it off by force 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.500
 look at how to use it on big man ed 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.960
 it is that it leaves and so does not do so much 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 damage but if we withdraw the blow 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.500
 normal of the sword so look 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
 catches on practically one 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.409
 sharpless I don't know how long I try to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.290
 do is a test on the witter then 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.290
 let's see how much resistance the heads with 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.250
 her was so much the creative too 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.770
 just one 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.920
 the head and oritan is true that if it is there 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.690
 skeleton dated the heads the heads where 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.780
 I find here meanwhile I must say that i 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.450
 guys you will find for now with less 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.100
 mode videos I'll make more videos on others 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.560
 genres for the simple reason that 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.880
 as they have updated 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.250
 there are a really lousy number I say 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.590
 debugging for now so they have it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.420
 solved through this version though 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.420
 I have to say that I have enough work 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.510
 useless since it did n't help 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.950
 this update or here is indeed for 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.320
 let's take lives spending it 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.570
 initial outbreak 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.050
 come on you want to see if the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.070
 strength on with her very good now 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.600
 explodes perfect come here ok it works 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.220
 also on the process as you see and also goes to 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.530
 long distance we try to give it a shot 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510
 look at the damage is really high I have to 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.730
 say that with a few bodies we can 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 kill a with her novra cells comes 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.360
 I'm giving like a dozen take damage 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.540
 even when he defends himself and is already dead 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.630
 how did you see the star but has it in 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.940
 hand here's nothing guys I have to say that is 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.040
 a great fashion is still work in progress 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.049
 so don't expect so much for 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.850
 now then in the next versions it will be 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.530
 much better 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.959
 expect new videos on the tea 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.720
 legend of her o'brien the let's play e 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.610
