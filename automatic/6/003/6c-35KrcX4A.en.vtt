00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.170 
to the minecraft forms where the post
was<00:03:45.989> originally<00:03:46.620> created<00:03:46.769> by<00:03:47.130> auntie<00:03:47.609> mod<00:03:47.819> PE

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
was originally created by auntie mod PE

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.979 
was originally created by auntie mod PE
so<00:03:48.569> anyway<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.910> level<00:03:51.269> right<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:51.510> and

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
so anyway I have one level right now and

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.050 
so anyway I have one level right now and
it<00:03:52.380> looks<00:03:52.590> like<00:03:52.680> none<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.549> those<00:03:53.760> are<00:03:53.940> one

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060
