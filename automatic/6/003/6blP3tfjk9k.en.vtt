three hours I mean they were trying very

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.400 
three hours I mean they were trying very
hard<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:05.310> let<00:00:06.150> their<00:00:06.330> voices<00:00:06.540> be<00:00:06.750> heard<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
hard to let their voices be heard and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.669 
hard to let their voices be heard and

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
chant CM Punk and all that and there's a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.320 
chant CM Punk and all that and there's a
couple<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.219> spots<00:00:11.550> throughout<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.120> night

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
couple of spots throughout the night

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
couple of spots throughout the night
where<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> didn't<00:00:13.259> mind<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.950> particular

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
where I didn't mind it in particular

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.750 
where I didn't mind it in particular
when<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.299> came<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.529> Divas<00:00:17.190> match<00:00:17.490> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
when it came to the Divas match I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
when it came to the Divas match I
believe<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.660> SCADA<00:00:19.050> teaming<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.980> with

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
believe it was a SCADA teaming up with

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.480 
believe it was a SCADA teaming up with
Alicia<00:00:20.490> Fox<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.570> take<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.930> The<00:00:22.050> Bella<00:00:22.230> Twins

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
even though it was somewhat of a decent

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.509 
even though it was somewhat of a decent
match<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:25.470> didn't<00:00:26.039> mind<00:00:26.070> them

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
match I actually didn't mind them

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
chanting it during that particular

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
taken on Emma and Santino I just thought

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400 
taken on Emma and Santino I just thought
that<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:37.980> silly<00:00:38.550> altogether<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.809> didn't

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that was just silly altogether I didn't

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.470 
that was just silly altogether I didn't
mind<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> fans<00:00:41.309> were<00:00:41.640> chanting<00:00:41.670> then

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
mind it when the fans were chanting then

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.889 
mind it when the fans were chanting then
but<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.590> hear<00:00:43.860> them<00:00:44.100> chanting<00:00:44.489> Christian<00:00:45.390> vs

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
but to hear them chanting Christian vs

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.319 
but to hear them chanting Christian vs
sheamus<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.340> had<00:00:47.489> some<00:00:47.730> people<00:00:47.760> say<00:00:48.180> all

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250

these two lock it up so many times are
ready<00:00:55.770> especially<00:00:56.129> when<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.699> was<00:00:56.820> over<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
ready especially when it was over the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
understand that point but the past

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.280 
understand that point but the past
couple<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> times<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.870> they've<00:01:04.110> been

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
for real it could have been worse guys

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.510 
for real it could have been worse guys
we<00:01:11.970> could<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.390> seen<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> match<00:01:13.049> again<00:01:13.860> we

titus O'Neil and Darren Young and that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.810 
titus O'Neil and Darren Young and that
really<00:01:17.670> hasn't<00:01:18.060> been<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.979> anywhere<00:01:19.979> okay<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
really hasn't been going anywhere okay I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
really hasn't been going anywhere okay I
remember<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:21.689> guys<00:01:21.960> fought<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.470> last

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
remember these guys fought on last

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980 
remember these guys fought on last
week's<00:01:23.040> main<00:01:23.280> event<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.909> thought<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
week's main event I thought that was a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.469 
week's main event I thought that was a
yawn<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.590> thought<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
yawn I thought what they did at the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
yawn I thought what they did at the
elimination<00:01:27.990> chamber<00:01:28.439> pay-per-view<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
elimination chamber pay-per-view was a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
elimination chamber pay-per-view was a
young<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.200> honestly<00:01:31.200> could<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.530> been<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> lot

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
young so honestly could have been a lot

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.760 
young so honestly could have been a lot
worse<00:01:32.070> guys<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.270> honestly<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
worse guys but honestly I think for the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
worse guys but honestly I think for the
Chicago<00:01:35.369> fans<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.970> were<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Chicago fans that were there in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.550 
Chicago fans that were there in
