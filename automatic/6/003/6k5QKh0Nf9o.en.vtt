 hello I'm better 18 and today I'm going to teach you how to pass the gt to san 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.770
 andreas' by rip 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.840
 it took me a long time to upload it to end parts and sfx to half fire so 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.649
 please if you download them I commented do not score 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.859
 warned that all download links are in the description of the video are 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.109
 six links of the five ends of the sfx 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.880
 and one of the game for the games saved and also warned that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.539
 you can download all the links together 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.519
 good let's start with the patch this patch what it does is create us a 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.240
 folder in my documents called gt a san andreas' usher falls 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.480
 Inside this folder will be the games saved in gallery will be 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.510
 the photos we take with the camera and in usher trates we can put our 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.900
 favorite songs to listen to while we drive on the radio 'call 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.510
 user songs 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.380
 to install this patch they just have to enter the download link they give to 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.430
 click rotates a plus to start the download 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.940
 unzip the rar file when unzipping it will appear a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.620
 installer 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.560
 When we open it, a window appears in a strange language 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.750
 I think it's French 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.830
 give you the courier par here we look where we have installed the gt a san 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.510
 andreas in my case my pc disk c program files gt a san andreas 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.190
 they give him to accept then to install and this poster will come out asking us if 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.010
 we want to replace you give it the uvi pour tous I give it to annul because 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.420
 I already have it but you choose that option and ready 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080
 they would have to have the patch installed 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.190
 now we are going to install the crashes silos sfx the crashes are the radios 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.450
 for example radio x my favorite csr 'radio los santos 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.720
 among others 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.180
 and the sfx are the voices background music sounds of missions and exempt 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.810
 I repeat the notice that you can download all the links together or in parallel 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 because they are uploaded to half file 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.280
 when we download all the links make sure you have all the files 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.010
 They are downloaded in the same folder 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.860
 to unzip you right click the first part of the ends and sfx 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.869
 the one that is called star goes to us and jordi cioch or point part 1 i sfx valley jordiet 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.269
 and eight point for everything 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.530
 you give right click to those two files and they give you to extract here this will take 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:16.469
 a little 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.829
 when they are unzipped all the files will appear correctly 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.049
 two folders one call crash if the other sfx copy or cut the two 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.739
 folders paste them into the audio folder that is where we have 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.859
 installed the gt a san andreas 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.209
 they will ask if they want to replace 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.799
 I give it to cancel but you give your yes to everything wait for it to be replaced 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.229
 everything and 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.989
 already have the gt a san andreas' full 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.219
