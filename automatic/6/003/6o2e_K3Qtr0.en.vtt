to<00:00:05.100> describe<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> do<00:00:06.029> what<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.299> want<00:00:06.450> to

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
to describe how to do what you want to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.820 
to describe how to do what you want to
do<00:00:06.629> i<00:00:06.660> thought<00:00:06.930> it'd<00:00:07.020> be<00:00:07.049> easier<00:00:07.500> just<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
do i thought it'd be easier just to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.669 
do i thought it'd be easier just to
quickly<00:00:08.660> record<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.719> video<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.170> show<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.410> how

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
quickly record a video to show you how

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.230 
quickly record a video to show you how
to<00:00:10.769> do<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.700> want<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.300> combine<00:00:12.900> two<00:00:14.240> objects

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
to do it you want to combine two objects

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.390 
to do it you want to combine two objects
into<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> single<00:00:16.049> object<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.590> attach<00:00:17.039> them

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
into a single object that attach them

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.700 
into a single object that attach them
you<00:00:18.119> were<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> right<00:00:18.750> track<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.500> have

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you were on the right track you do have

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.950 
you were on the right track you do have
to<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> combined<00:00:20.490> well<00:00:21.270> after<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.750> do<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to do a combined well after you do the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.810 
to do a combined well after you do the
combined<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.189> somehow<00:00:23.430> merge

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
combined then you have to somehow merge

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720 
combined then you have to somehow merge
the<00:00:24.060> vertices<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.680> two<00:00:26.039> objects<00:00:26.580> together

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the vertices of the two objects together

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.140 
the vertices of the two objects together
to<00:00:27.119> form<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> single<00:00:27.810> object<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:29.000> starting<00:00:30.000> by

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to form a single object so starting by

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.940 
to form a single object so starting by
creating<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.080> two<00:00:32.009> cube<00:00:32.369> objects<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:39.950> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
creating the two cube objects here to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:01:03.410 
creating the two cube objects here to
the<00:00:41.070> top<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 

okay<00:01:04.259> there's<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.799> two<00:01:05.009> objects<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> they're

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
okay there's our two objects and they're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.539 
okay there's our two objects and they're
not<00:01:05.939> quite<00:01:06.360> exactly<00:01:06.509> lined<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.130> let's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
not quite exactly lined up so let's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.700 
not quite exactly lined up so let's
first<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.509> get<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> fixed<00:01:10.350> I'll<00:01:10.500> take

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
first of all get that fixed I'll take

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.420 
first of all get that fixed I'll take
these<00:01:10.890> four<00:01:11.880> verts<00:01:12.299> oh<00:01:15.530> snap<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> there

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
these four verts oh snap them to there

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.190 
these four verts oh snap them to there
and<00:01:18.360> I'll<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:20.720> these<00:01:21.720> four<00:01:22.110> verts<00:01:23.960> then<00:01:24.960> I'll

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and I'll take these four verts then I'll

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
and I'll take these four verts then I'll
snap<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.789> I'm<00:01:27.090> doing<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
snap up to here and I'm doing that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.980 
snap up to here and I'm doing that
snapping<00:01:27.899> by<00:01:28.880> moving<00:01:29.880> moving<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.689> vertices

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
snapping by moving moving the vertices

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
snapping by moving moving the vertices
along<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> axis<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> move<00:01:32.460> them<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
along the axis I want to move them on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260 
along the axis I want to move them on
and<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:33.450> holding<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.030> middle<00:01:36.030> mouse

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and then holding down the middle mouse

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.230 
and then holding down the middle mouse
are<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.750> C<00:01:36.990> key<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:38.190> curved<00:01:38.460> snap<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.030> then

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
are the C key for curved snap I then

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.230 
are the C key for curved snap I then
middle<00:01:39.630> mouse<00:01:39.810> gesture<00:01:40.500> over<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> net<00:01:41.789> curve

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
middle mouse gesture over that net curve

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.419 
middle mouse gesture over that net curve
and<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.659> snaps<00:01:43.200> those<00:01:43.470> guys<00:01:43.830> together<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
and it snaps those guys together so

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.760 
and it snaps those guys together so
there<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.569> like<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.170> said<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.590> can

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
there we go so like you said you can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.820 
there we go so like you said you can
take<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.190> object<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> object<00:01:48.830> this

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
take this object and that object this

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.800 
take this object and that object this
one<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.789> you<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:50.940> hit<00:01:51.270> combined

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
one in this one and you can hit combined

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
one in this one and you can hit combined
and<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.979> combines<00:01:53.220> them<00:01:53.580> together<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and it combines them together into a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.190 
and it combines them together into a
single<00:01:54.330> object<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.380> sign<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.830> pivot<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.429> can

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
single object if I sign on a pivot I can

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
single object if I sign on a pivot I can
take<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.440> move<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.280> together<00:01:59.640> now<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
take and move them together now when I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
take and move them together now when I
select<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.350> both<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> want

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
select one I get them both but you want

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.440 
select one I get them both but you want
to<00:02:04.860> make<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.250> object<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> first

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
to make them one object so the first

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.099 
to make them one object so the first
thing<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.680> need<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:09.239> realize<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.049> you

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
thing you need to do is realize that you

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.500 
thing you need to do is realize that you
got<00:02:10.259> two<00:02:10.440> faces<00:02:10.950> inside<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.579> here<00:02:11.850> right<00:02:12.239> so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
got two faces inside of here right so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.150 
got two faces inside of here right so
temporarily<00:02:12.989> I'm<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.500> separate<00:02:13.950> these

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
temporarily I'm going to separate these

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120 
temporarily I'm going to separate these
two<00:02:14.489> make<00:02:15.359> this<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.630> little<00:02:15.900> easier<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.769> so

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
two make this a little easier to do so

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.710 
two make this a little easier to do so
before<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.549> combine<00:02:18.030> them<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.359> just<00:02:18.540> hit<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
before I combine them so I just hit the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.120 
before I combine them so I just hit the
separate<00:02:19.109> so<00:02:19.260> there's<00:02:19.440> separate<00:02:19.739> objects

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
separate so there's separate objects

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.099 
separate so there's separate objects
again<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.549> actually<00:02:20.820> going<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.150> pull<00:02:21.959> them

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
again I'm actually going to pull them

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.310 
again I'm actually going to pull them
apart<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> connect<00:02:24.989> these<00:02:25.109> guys

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
apart I want to connect these guys

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.930 
apart I want to connect these guys
together<00:02:25.530> eventually<00:02:25.829> so<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> first<00:02:26.670> thing<00:02:26.760> I

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
together eventually so the first thing I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.060 
together eventually so the first thing I
need<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.840> need<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.140> add<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.290> geometry

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
need to do is I need to add the geometry

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.440 
need to do is I need to add the geometry
that<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.250> need<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.609> be<00:02:29.730> able<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.000> connect<00:02:30.299> them

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that I need to be able to connect them

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.970 
that I need to be able to connect them
so<00:02:30.600> I'm<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.989> do<00:02:31.140> an<00:02:31.260> insert<00:02:31.680> edge<00:02:31.950> loop

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
so I'm going to do an insert edge loop

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.610 
so I'm going to do an insert edge loop
here<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:33.120> I'm<00:02:33.720> going<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> throw<00:02:34.079> an<00:02:34.230> edge<00:02:34.350> loop

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
here and I'm going to throw an edge loop

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.979 
here and I'm going to throw an edge loop
right<00:02:34.920> around<00:02:35.190> here<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.930> did

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
right around here and just like I did

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.319 
right around here and just like I did
before<00:02:37.230> I'm<00:02:37.560> gonna<00:02:37.680> hit<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.859> W<00:02:38.280> key<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.209> now

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
before I'm gonna hit the W key and now

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.599 
before I'm gonna hit the W key and now
i'm<00:02:39.480> moving<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.049> since<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.739> this

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
i'm moving that since this is a this

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.870 
i'm moving that since this is a this
object<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.269> just<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.900> cube<00:02:43.350> i<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.760> instead<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
object is just a a cube i can instead of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.610 
object is just a a cube i can instead of
slight<00:02:45.209> edge<00:02:45.480> i<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.079> move<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.500> edge

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
slight edge i can just move the edge

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.160 
slight edge i can just move the edge
where<00:02:46.859> I<00:02:46.950> want<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.519> then<00:02:47.700> hit<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.170> holding

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
where I want and then hit this holding

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.750 
where I want and then hit this holding
the<00:02:49.290> V<00:02:49.470> key<00:02:49.739> down<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> middle<00:02:50.609> mouse

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the V key down I can middle mouse

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.849 
the V key down I can middle mouse
gesture<00:02:51.299> or<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.720> vertex<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.470> now<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> know

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
gesture or that vertex and now I know

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.250 
gesture or that vertex and now I know
that<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.220> edge<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.730> lined<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.390> with<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that this edge is lined up with that and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.199 
that this edge is lined up with that and
in<00:02:55.709> order<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.980> combine<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:56.640> guys<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.150> don't

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
in order to combine these guys I don't

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.479 
in order to combine these guys I don't
want<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.840> internal<00:02:58.380> faces<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.340> to

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
want to have internal faces so I have to

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.240 
want to have internal faces so I have to
take<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.730> face<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.600> face

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.890 

and<00:03:03.880> delete<00:03:04.180> them<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.970> can<00:03:07.540> take<00:03:07.720> this

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and delete them and now I can take this

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.240 
and delete them and now I can take this
guy<00:03:08.050> again<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:09.010> can<00:03:09.190> put<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.490> back<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:11.160> can<00:03:12.160> be

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
guy again and I can put it back I can be

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.520 
guy again and I can put it back I can be
SuperDuper<00:03:12.670> precise<00:03:13.390> about<00:03:13.600> this<00:03:13.990> or<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> can

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
SuperDuper precise about this or I can

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.140 
SuperDuper precise about this or I can
just<00:03:14.560> sort<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:14.980> eyeball<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.460> like<00:03:15.730> I'm<00:03:15.880> doing

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
just sort of eyeball it like I'm doing

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.390 
just sort of eyeball it like I'm doing
right<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:17.560> what<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:17.800> can<00:03:18.040> do<00:03:18.220> now

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
right there and then what I can do now

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.870 
right there and then what I can do now
is<00:03:18.430> take<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.030> part<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.340> other<00:03:21.459> combined

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
is take that part do it other combined

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.460 
is take that part do it other combined
again<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:24.300> now<00:03:25.300> what<00:03:25.510> i<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.750> do<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:25.959> grab

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
again and now what i can do is grab

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.920 
again and now what i can do is grab
those<00:03:26.709> two<00:03:26.770> vertices<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.790> go<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.090> merge<00:03:28.600> verte

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
those two vertices and go to merge verte

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.080 
those two vertices and go to merge verte
and<00:03:29.140> then<00:03:29.950> i<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.250> do<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> same<00:03:30.670> thing<00:03:30.940> with

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and then i can do the same thing with

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.140 
and then i can do the same thing with
these<00:03:31.270> two<00:03:31.480> vertices<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.459> now<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.850> see<00:03:34.120> that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
these two vertices and now you see that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.140 
these two vertices and now you see that
that<00:03:34.860> heavy<00:03:35.860> edge<00:03:36.130> goes<00:03:36.489> away<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.970> means

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
that heavy edge goes away that means

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.290 
that heavy edge goes away that means
those<00:03:37.450> those<00:03:38.400> vertices<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:39.730> combined<00:03:40.150> and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
those those vertices are combined and

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.090 
those those vertices are combined and
that's<00:03:40.480> now<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> single<00:03:41.140> edge<00:03:41.380> instead<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.830> two

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
that's now a single edge instead of two

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.940 
that's now a single edge instead of two
edges<00:03:42.550> or<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.760> border<00:03:43.180> edge<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.470> i<00:03:44.530> can<00:03:44.770> select

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
edges or a border edge so i can select

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.690 
edges or a border edge so i can select
those<00:03:45.250> two<00:03:45.520> guys<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.530> merge<00:03:47.530> again<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.220> now

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
those two guys and merge again and now

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.050 
those two guys and merge again and now
we<00:03:48.760> have<00:03:51.209> two<00:03:52.209> cubes<00:03:52.540> combined<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.760> there<00:03:54.940> you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
we have two cubes combined so there you

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.210 
we have two cubes combined so there you
