loads<00:01:44.420> been<00:01:44.630> released<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.170> see<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.440> battery

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
loads been released you see the battery

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.250 
loads been released you see the battery
coming<00:01:46.070> back<00:01:46.280> up<00:01:46.580> this<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.720> 12<00:01:48.020> volt<00:01:48.200> battery

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
coming back up this is a 12 volt battery

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.290 
coming back up this is a 12 volt battery
so<00:01:48.770> we<00:01:48.890> either<00:01:48.979> have<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.280> low<00:01:49.580> state<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.030> charge

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
so we either have a low state of charge

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.380 
so we either have a low state of charge
we<00:01:50.600> do<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.020> bad<00:01:51.290> battery<00:01:52.240> shortly<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
we do have a bad battery shortly the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.240 
we do have a bad battery shortly the
load<00:01:53.570> will<00:01:53.720> be<00:01:53.750> applied<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.440> second<00:01:54.890> time<00:01:55.040> on

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
load will be applied the second time on

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.440

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
vehicle back up let's try to check those

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.380 
vehicle back up let's try to check those
two<00:02:42.250> here's<00:02:43.250> our<00:02:43.400> new<00:02:43.550> battery<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
two here's our new battery the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.180 
two here's our new battery the
installation<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.500> reversal<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
installation is just a reversal of the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.140 
installation is just a reversal of the
removal<00:02:46.730> procedure
