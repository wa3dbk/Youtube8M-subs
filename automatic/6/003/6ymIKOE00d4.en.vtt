00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.170
 m 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.209
 the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.070
 before emigrating to Canada it's this 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.750
 language story that can worry a 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.489
 a little bit the other we ask ourselves 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.079
 questions we say to myself is I going there 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.780
 arrive 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.710
 yes everyone there is this 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.510
 talent collector it's just a 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.010
 matter of time and all the world 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.769
 for some it takes six months to 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.360
 others it takes two years but it's worth 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.739
 the sentence 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.470
 regarding this last job and 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.829
 the job preceding bilingualism was 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.589
 a small team compulsory thing 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.589
 so what I bring that for sure is 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.220
 precisely this ability to evolve in 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.199
 both languages 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.049
 on the professional level should not have 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.559
 afraid of not being able to speak English 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.089
 because we have so much 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.490
 of immigrants what people are 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.000
 already accustomed to hearing English who 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.220
 is not correct and that's it 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080
 really this side where we give the thing to 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.210
 a person to show what she is 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.130
 able to do in this country that 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 asserts itself and ennahdha the francophones 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.820
 have managed a little 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.499
 difficult in some places to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 survive by keeping their one without 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:29.659
 shut yourself open to others 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.909
 it's important is more and more 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.619
 many young anglophones have their 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.130
 language that decides to learn the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.859
 French 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.310
 that's important from a province to 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.810
 the other 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.759
 you are able with organizations of 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.649
 improve yourself 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.179
 other language when I arrived in 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.509
 saskatchewan there were organizations 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.390
 that they were ready to teach 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.360
 English to see you 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 allow me to become net when 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.210
 we are new to redon here although we 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.700
 speaks that French should not be 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 put in the head that language 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 French is a handicap 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.490
 we must rather put ourselves in the head 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.860
 that we are human beings endowed 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.760
 ability to learn and then to 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.709
 perfecting so it takes a certain 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.370
 moment accept the fact that one is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.450
 Francophone and agreed to engage in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 the way to learn English
