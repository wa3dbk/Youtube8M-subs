00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 we find ourselves today with a big 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.000
 exploit cook and I start with my 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.460
 phase all naked and dry I apply 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.150
 the eye contour wonderful look 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 of sanoflore and then as cream 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.720
 hello I use the cream at the pile of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.359
 doctor at the time he is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.510
 via moisturizing that is not too oily 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.230
 so that feels more and that I like 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.230
 Verry much 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.640
 then I put a little balm to 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.920
 lips if these loustics Hebron of weleda 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.720
 which is not bad which is better in summer 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 because they do a little bit in truth 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.160
 little echoes and then that I attack the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.620
 make up so I use the tinted cream 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.620
 pure radiance of nars encoder groenland 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.640
 that I still love as much as I am 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
 really getting to the bottom at 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.309
 bottom of the nineteenth is not too much 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.839
 sun right now but that's the spf of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.790
 30 days so we apply everywhere to the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.730
 hand because I think that's what 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.860
 works best and then I tap 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.500
 a little bit to try to fade 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.890
 possible fingerprints that refuses 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.470
 that they could have insinuated on my 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 face 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.860
 the same thing on the front and it's already 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.080
 a little better 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.570
 I attack then it anti serves so I 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.960
 went back to the mix of the two colors to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.000
 know of custard and of to and the weight and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.940
 ben hello i do not know the ginger anymore 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.920
 this is good I remember so I 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.720
 still put more than start 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.650
 ginger 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.620
 ginger it's really just for 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.530
 warm up a little bit of size 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.690
 so I apply audois shame gesture well 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.710
 everything all over the net 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.270
 usually and with what's on my 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.840
 homework I do a little bit the outline of the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.910
 stuffy 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.140
 the wings of the nose this is very 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.190
 slight because in general I do not like 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.440
 see one thing one was completely 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.960
 the lure I attack the eyebrows with 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.379
 my beloved arms or at claude lined 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.360
 brown in color mahogany so the tree 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.550
 very simple I'm just drawing a whole 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.410
 little bit eyebrows especially at the level 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.459
 of the head 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.660
 what they are a little bit they are 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.489
 all types offered only at the level of 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.700
 the head of this thing is still 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.069
 awesome 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.580
 it really takes two seconds I l 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.040
 adore and then those moments of the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.560
 naughty base and the banik team is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.030
 still not here it is still there 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.000
 is ever on the entire eyelid 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.040
 is a little bit gold and it's the inside 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.650
 I'm obviously suffering 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.360
 something is to be impartial I 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.950
 continue with this very beautiful shadows to 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.530
 eyelids from l'orÃ©al that I could 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.630
 create as much so there like that I 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.190
 can not remember 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.440
 world is not very serious 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.989
 so I apply them on all my 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.690
 eyelid with a small brush six 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.510
 ending 2010 sets of water and 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.090
 then I put a little bit in the corner 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.680
 internally on precisely to catch 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.680
 really a very nice effect a 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 potential 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.220
 I take it so that's darker from the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.500
 john's fans head had of her and I 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.889
 come then miserably tempted of iron 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:34.000
 little bananas and bananas 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:37.120
 so you can see it is 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.900
 because that's it after serious 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.549
 so the same thing on the other side and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.790

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.019

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.060
