00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.930 

kind<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.269> taper<00:00:44.480> off<00:00:44.719> this<00:00:45.489> yeah<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.550> think<00:00:46.670> we

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
kind of taper off this yeah I think we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.369 
kind of taper off this yeah I think we
got<00:00:46.969> away<00:00:47.210> from<00:00:47.480> our<00:00:47.629> game<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.839> little<00:00:48.019> bit<00:00:48.109> in<00:00:48.289> a

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
got away from our game a little bit in a

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.569 
got away from our game a little bit in a
second<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:48.980> every<00:00:49.429> turn<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:49.820> puck<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.030> lot<00:00:50.269> and

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
second and every turn the puck a lot and

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.529 
second and every turn the puck a lot and
we<00:00:52.579> gave<00:00:52.729> them<00:00:52.879> they<00:00:53.690> got<00:00:53.839> the<00:00:53.960> momentum<00:00:54.199> and

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
we gave them they got the momentum and

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.880 
we gave them they got the momentum and
so<00:00:56.539> it's<00:00:56.690> not<00:00:56.839> exactly<00:00:57.019> all<00:00:57.409> we<00:00:57.530> want<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.769> play

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
so it's not exactly all we want to play

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.560 
so it's not exactly all we want to play
we<00:00:58.039> want<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.280> play<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.460> full<00:00:58.699> 60<00:00:58.969> minutes<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.479> we

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
we want to play a full 60 minutes and we

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.500 
we want to play a full 60 minutes and we
didn't<00:00:59.809> do<00:00:59.869> that<00:00:59.930> tonight<00:01:00.969> Jonathan<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.390> much

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.119 
didn't do that tonight Jonathan so much
attention<00:01:02.809> was<00:01:03.049> paid<00:01:03.079> on<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.500> defensive<00:01:04.070> zone

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
attention was paid on the defensive zone

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.370 
attention was paid on the defensive zone

to<00:01:06.439> make<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.740> system<00:01:06.950> coming<00:01:07.430> into<00:01:07.580> this

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
to make the system coming into this

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.340 
to make the system coming into this
season<00:01:07.909> how<00:01:08.119> did<00:01:08.149> you<00:01:08.360> assess<00:01:08.689> from<00:01:09.229> your

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.749 
season how did you assess from your
point<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.649> view<00:01:09.710> how<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.100> one<00:01:10.280> for<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.580> team

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
point of view how that one for the team

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.529 
point of view how that one for the team
tonight<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:12.789> thought<00:01:13.789> we<00:01:13.939> played<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.210> solid

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
tonight I thought we played a solid

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.639 
tonight I thought we played a solid
first<00:01:14.929> period<00:01:15.289> I<00:01:15.830> definitely<00:01:16.729> want<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.649> get

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
first period I definitely want to get

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.100 
first period I definitely want to get
that<00:01:18.770> first<00:01:19.039> first<00:01:19.789> goal<00:01:20.030> back<00:01:20.270> he<00:01:20.720> found<00:01:20.990> on

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
that first first goal back he found on

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.949 
that first first goal back he found on
it<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.679> fooled<00:01:21.890> me<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:22.190> bit<00:01:22.429> but<00:01:22.670> I

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959 
it and it fooled me a little bit but I

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.559 
it and it fooled me a little bit but I
just<00:01:23.959> saw<00:01:24.049> our<00:01:24.080> second<00:01:24.619> period<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.250> like<00:01:26.209> Roby

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
just saw our second period we like Roby

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.059 
just saw our second period we like Roby
just<00:01:26.780> mentioned<00:01:27.229> I<00:01:27.289> think<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.649> got<00:01:27.799> away<00:01:27.920> from

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
just mentioned I think we got away from

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.020 
just mentioned I think we got away from
our<00:01:28.399> game<00:01:29.240> plan<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.310> that's<00:01:31.580> when<00:01:31.819> they

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
our game plan and and that's when they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.309 
our game plan and and that's when they
they<00:01:32.240> gave<00:01:32.420> me<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.539> little<00:01:32.659> bit<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.899> momentum<00:01:33.020> in

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
they gave me a little bit of momentum in

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.260 
they gave me a little bit of momentum in
the<00:01:33.470> game<00:01:33.649> but<00:01:33.799> we<00:01:34.399> battled<00:01:34.729> back<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:34.940> then

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the game but we battled back and then

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.059 
the game but we battled back and then
they<00:01:35.450> got<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:35.990> funny<00:01:36.229> bounce<00:01:36.470> at<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.679> end
