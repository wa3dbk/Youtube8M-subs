00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
that yeah I i think it's it's nice

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.530 
that yeah I i think it's it's nice
because<00:02:47.800> he<00:02:47.890> knows<00:02:48.250> where<00:02:48.550> we<00:02:48.820> are<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.420> know

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
because he knows where we are you know

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.600 
because he knows where we are you know
he<00:02:49.660> knows<00:02:49.840> how<00:02:50.530> we<00:02:50.590> feel<00:02:50.709> like<00:02:51.250> when<00:02:51.489> we're

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
he knows how we feel like when we're

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.280 
he knows how we feel like when we're
getting<00:02:51.700> tired<00:02:52.060> he<00:02:52.420> knows<00:02:52.600> like<00:02:52.810> when<00:02:53.019> we<00:02:53.140> need

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
getting tired he knows like when we need

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.050 
getting tired he knows like when we need
a<00:02:53.320> break<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.040> think<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.340> also<00:02:54.489> makes<00:02:54.820> us

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
a break and I think that also makes us

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.320 
a break and I think that also makes us
want<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> work<00:02:55.750> harder<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.530> him<00:02:56.739> because<00:02:57.330> you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
want to work harder for him because you

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.180 
want to work harder for him because you
know<00:02:58.420> he's<00:02:58.690> he<00:02:59.170> treats<00:02:59.440> us<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.739> well<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.100> we

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
know he's he treats us so well so we

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.680 
know he's he treats us so well so we
want<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.430> give<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.700> back<00:03:00.880> yeah<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.450> can

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690
