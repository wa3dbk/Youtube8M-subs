the<00:00:23.970> talents<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.480> using<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:24.869> now

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the talents that I'm using there now

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
the talents that I'm using there now
technically<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.460> not<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.820> using<00:00:27.180> all

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
technically I'm not actually using all

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.140 
technically I'm not actually using all
these<00:00:27.960> talents<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> video<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.970> that's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
these talents in the video but that's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.390 
these talents in the video but that's
because<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.720> forgot<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.019> swap<00:00:31.320> them<00:00:31.560> this

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
because I just forgot to swap them this

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.910 
because I just forgot to swap them this
is<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> setup<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.510> would<00:00:33.720> use<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.680> was

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
is the setup that I would use if I was

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.880 
is the setup that I would use if I was
planning<00:00:35.219> ahead<00:00:35.309> properly<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.739> main

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
planning ahead properly so the main

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
planning ahead properly so the main
thing<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.160> don't<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.640> healing<00:00:38.850> elixirs<00:00:39.410> which

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
thing I don't have healing elixirs which

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
thing I don't have healing elixirs which
would<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.890> nice<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.460> extra<00:00:41.670> heals<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
would be nice for the extra heals and I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850 
would be nice for the extra heals and I
don't<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> tire<00:00:42.930> pet<00:00:43.260> which<00:00:43.590> would<00:00:43.770> be

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
don't know the tire pet which would be

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.119 
don't know the tire pet which would be
good<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.030> DPS<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> other<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.050> level<00:00:46.860> 90

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
good for the DPS the other two level 90

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.869 
good for the DPS the other two level 90
talents<00:00:47.760> aren't<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.300> useful<00:00:49.489> but<00:00:50.489> yeah

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
talents aren't really useful but yeah

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
talents aren't really useful but yeah
this<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> fight<00:00:52.110> isn't<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> difficult

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this is a fight isn't all that difficult

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
this is a fight isn't all that difficult
so<00:00:53.730> let's<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.120> rewind<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> we'll<00:00:54.809> get

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
so let's just rewind and we'll get

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
so let's just rewind and we'll get
started<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> walkthrough<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> before

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
started with the walkthrough so before

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
started with the walkthrough so before
you<00:01:00.000> begin<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> poll<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.199> should<00:01:01.379> consider

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you begin the poll you should consider

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
you begin the poll you should consider
which<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.000> five<00:01:03.210> Drake's<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> have

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
which of the five Drake's you have

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
which of the five Drake's you have
activated<00:01:04.649> for<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.129> particular<00:01:05.430> rate<00:01:05.789> as

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
activated for your particular rate as

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.660 
activated for your particular rate as
you<00:01:06.990> may<00:01:07.110> recall<00:01:07.260> three<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> five<00:01:08.250> Drake's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you may recall three of the five Drake's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.520 
you may recall three of the five Drake's
are<00:01:08.820> randomly<00:01:09.240> selected<00:01:09.720> every<00:01:09.990> raid<00:01:10.260> week

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
are randomly selected every raid week

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.149 
are randomly selected every raid week
and<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.119> active<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.159> depending

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and those will be active and depending

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
and those will be active and depending
on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> three<00:01:14.610> changed<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> dynamics<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
on the three changed the dynamics and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.030 
on the three changed the dynamics and
the<00:01:16.080> abilities<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> fight<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.860> this

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the abilities for the fight so in this

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
the abilities for the fight so in this
case<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.820> doesn't<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.360> matter<00:01:21.659> which<00:01:21.930> ones

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
case it doesn't really matter which ones

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.070 
case it doesn't really matter which ones
you<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.439> except<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.299> another<00:01:24.540> Scion

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
you get except if you have another Scion

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.520 
you get except if you have another Scion
if<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.310> another<00:01:26.549> sign<00:01:26.790> active<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
if you have another sign active then the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
if you have another sign active then the
fight<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.890> significantly<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.000> difficult

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
fight is significantly more difficult

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.370 
fight is significantly more difficult
it's<00:01:30.689> still<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.080> hard<00:01:32.479> but<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:34.170> does

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it's still not very hard but it does

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's still not very hard but it does
make<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> more<00:01:34.680> challenging<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.340> don't

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
make it more challenging if you don't

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.090 
make it more challenging if you don't
have<00:01:35.579> another<00:01:35.759> sign<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.570> basically

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
have another sign you can just basically

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.200 
have another sign you can just basically
activate<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.250> three<00:01:38.490> Drake's<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> same

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
activate all three Drake's at the same

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
activate all three Drake's at the same
time<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.710> everything<00:01:41.220> down<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
time and just a everything down and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
time and just a everything down and
cackled<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.540> way<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> victory<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
cackled your way to victory but if you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.230 
cackled your way to victory but if you
have<00:01:44.159> another<00:01:44.400> sign<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.060> more

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
have another sign you have to be more

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
have another sign you have to be more
careful<00:01:45.950> now<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> reason<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
careful now the reason for this is that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
careful now the reason for this is that
the<00:01:48.180> nether<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.869> apply<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> buff<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.979> health

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the nether will apply a buff to health

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.789 
the nether will apply a buff to health
us<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> fight<00:01:51.180> called<00:01:52.049> frenzied<00:01:52.500> assault

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
us for the fight called frenzied assault

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.609 
us for the fight called frenzied assault
and<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:54.030> increases<00:01:54.450> offices<00:01:55.049> attack<00:01:55.380> damage

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and this increases offices attack damage

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.959 
and this increases offices attack damage
by<00:01:55.920> 120%<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.530> dangerous<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.219> he

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
by 120% and this is dangerous because he

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
by 120% and this is dangerous because he
will<00:02:00.119> also<00:02:00.509> use<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.899> malevolent<00:02:01.380> strikes

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
will also use the malevolent strikes

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.450 
will also use the malevolent strikes
ability<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> stacking<00:02:04.860> healing

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
ability this is a stacking healing

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.419 
ability this is a stacking healing
reduction<00:02:05.939> debuff<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.869> player<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:08.100> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
reduction debuff on the player and it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.400 
reduction debuff on the player and it
increases<00:02:08.759> heat<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.269> reduces<00:02:09.720> healing<00:02:10.019> by<00:02:10.140> 6%

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
increases heat or reduces healing by 6%

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.680 
increases heat or reduces healing by 6%
per<00:02:10.920> stack<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.300> 15

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
per stack and this can go up to 15

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.619 
per stack and this can go up to 15
stacks<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.730> connects

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
stacks and this connects

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.619 
stacks and this connects
or<00:02:16.230> apply<00:02:16.680> stack<00:02:17.040> every<00:02:17.340> time<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.879> melee<00:02:18.390> hit

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
or apply stack every time a melee hit

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.069 
or apply stack every time a melee hit
connects<00:02:18.989> pretty<00:02:19.290> much<00:02:19.579> so<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.780> reason<00:02:22.049> that

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
connects pretty much so the reason that

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.899 
connects pretty much so the reason that
attack<00:02:22.469> speed<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.099> dangerous<00:02:23.280> obviously

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
attack speed is so dangerous obviously

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.739 
attack speed is so dangerous obviously
is<00:02:23.999> because<00:02:24.359> this<00:02:24.870> will<00:02:25.109> go<00:02:26.099> very<00:02:26.280> quickly

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:26.749 
is because this will go very quickly

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.089 
is because this will go very quickly
when<00:02:27.749> it<00:02:27.959> offices<00:02:28.409> attacking<00:02:28.859> a<00:02:28.889> hundred

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
when it offices attacking a hundred

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.509 
when it offices attacking a hundred
twenty<00:02:29.280> percent<00:02:29.579> faster<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:32.099> you<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.400> have

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
twenty percent faster so if you do have

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.879 
twenty percent faster so if you do have
the<00:02:32.609> nether<00:02:32.760> Sion<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.439> therefore<00:02:34.439> malevolent

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
the nether Sion and therefore malevolent

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.940 
the nether Sion and therefore malevolent
strikes<00:02:35.129> will<00:02:35.879> be<00:02:36.000> an<00:02:36.090> issue<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.950> suggest

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
strikes will be an issue I suggest

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.619 
strikes will be an issue I suggest
taking<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.340> easy<00:02:38.519> you'll<00:02:38.969> want<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.180> attack<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
taking it easy you'll want to attack the

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.119 
taking it easy you'll want to attack the
nether<00:02:39.980> first<00:02:41.060> by<00:02:42.060> itself<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.750> once<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.919> dies

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
nether first by itself and once it dies

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.670 
nether first by itself and once it dies
then<00:02:44.849> houses<00:02:45.239> will<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:46.169> actually<00:02:46.469> once<00:02:46.620> you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
then houses will are actually once you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.709 
then houses will are actually once you
just<00:02:46.859> activate<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.639> helpless<00:02:48.419> will

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
just activate it really helpless will

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.659 
just activate it really helpless will
attack<00:02:49.049> slightly<00:02:50.040> slower<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.489> have<00:02:50.639> a

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
attack slightly slower and have a

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.129 
attack slightly slower and have a
reduced<00:02:51.389> hit<00:02:51.719> chance

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
reduced hit chance

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.809 
reduced hit chance
so<00:02:52.500> less<00:02:52.919> likely<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.459> you'll<00:02:53.609> get<00:02:53.760> a

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
so less likely that you'll get a

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.199 
so less likely that you'll get a
malevolent<00:02:54.209> strike<00:02:54.599> stack<00:02:55.280> once<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.549> nether

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
malevolent strike stack once the nether

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.059 
malevolent strike stack once the nether
sign<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.719> is<00:02:57.930> dead<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.469> can<00:02:58.590> activate<00:02:58.889> this

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
sign is is dead you can activate this

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.580 
sign is is dead you can activate this
the<00:02:59.459> next<00:03:00.359> drakes<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.079> this<00:03:01.199> case<00:03:01.409> I'm

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the next drakes so in this case I'm

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890 
the next drakes so in this case I'm
doing<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.889> sleet<00:03:02.329> because<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.510> will<00:03:03.599> apply<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
doing the sleet because it will apply a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
doing the sleet because it will apply a
stun<00:03:04.290> effect<00:03:04.439> to<00:03:04.949> health<00:03:05.129> as<00:03:05.310> every<00:03:05.459> once<00:03:05.639> in<00:03:05.699> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
stun effect to health as every once in a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.339 
stun effect to health as every once in a
while<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.169> again<00:03:07.169> that<00:03:07.349> just<00:03:07.590> reduces<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
while and again that just reduces the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.539 
while and again that just reduces the
chance<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.469> malevolent<00:03:10.739> strikes<00:03:11.159> will<00:03:11.370> stay

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
chance that malevolent strikes will stay

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.659 
chance that malevolent strikes will stay
active<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:12.000> me<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.169> then<00:03:13.980> finally<00:03:14.459> whatever

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
active on me and then finally whatever

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.970 
active on me and then finally whatever
Drake<00:03:15.329> is<00:03:15.510> remaining<00:03:15.840> other<00:03:16.560> than<00:03:16.799> those<00:03:16.919> two

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
Drake is remaining other than those two

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.909 
Drake is remaining other than those two
is<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.790> least<00:03:18.060> important<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.689> as<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.650> said<00:03:19.829> if

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
is the least important and as I said if

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.490 
is the least important and as I said if
you<00:03:19.979> don't<00:03:20.099> have<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.519> nether<00:03:21.049> Sion<00:03:22.049> in<00:03:22.290> your

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you don't have the nether Sion in your

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.349 
you don't have the nether Sion in your
setup<00:03:22.919> then<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.639> doesn't<00:03:23.909> matter<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> whole<00:03:24.209> lot

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
setup then it doesn't matter a whole lot

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.020 
setup then it doesn't matter a whole lot
which<00:03:24.689> order<00:03:25.199> you<00:03:25.319> do<00:03:25.500> or<00:03:25.769> how<00:03:26.459> often<00:03:26.729> you<00:03:26.819> grab

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
which order you do or how often you grab

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.550 
which order you do or how often you grab
them<00:03:27.209> or<00:03:27.299> anything<00:03:27.449> like<00:03:27.659> that<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:28.439> all

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
them or anything like that it's it's all

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.420 
them or anything like that it's it's all
pretty<00:03:28.769> easy

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.679 

now<00:03:32.430> one<00:03:32.639> thing<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.939> should<00:03:33.180> be<00:03:33.209> careful

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
now one thing you should be careful

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.569 
now one thing you should be careful
about<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.229> you<00:03:34.769> don't<00:03:35.009> get<00:03:35.129> health<00:03:35.370> is

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
about is that you don't get health is

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.050 
about is that you don't get health is
too<00:03:36.359> low<00:03:37.189> before<00:03:38.189> you<00:03:38.489> finish<00:03:38.669> all<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
too low before you finish all the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.379 
too low before you finish all the
Drake's<00:03:39.299> off<00:03:39.769> if<00:03:40.769> hellfish<00:03:41.189> reaches<00:03:41.489> 50%<00:03:41.790> he

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
Drake's off if hellfish reaches 50% he

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.240 
Drake's off if hellfish reaches 50% he
will<00:03:42.509> sort<00:03:42.689> of<00:03:42.750> enter<00:03:43.049> second<00:03:43.530> phase<00:03:43.739> where<00:03:44.069> he

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
will sort of enter second phase where he

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.920 
will sort of enter second phase where he
has<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> new<00:03:44.579> ability<00:03:44.819> called<00:03:45.239> furious<00:03:45.689> roar

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
has a new ability called furious roar

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.920 
has a new ability called furious roar
and<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.729> not<00:03:48.090> all<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.329> dangerous<00:03:48.689> when

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
and this is not all that dangerous when

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.420 
and this is not all that dangerous when
it's<00:03:49.049> just<00:03:49.199> human<00:03:49.379> health<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.799> there<00:03:50.159> you<00:03:50.310> can

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it's just human health is there you can

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.689 
it's just human health is there you can
see<00:03:50.549> he's<00:03:50.699> casting<00:03:51.090> now<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:53.069> just<00:03:53.159> stuns<00:03:53.519> you

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
see he's casting now it just stuns you

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.059 
see he's casting now it just stuns you
over<00:03:53.939> and<00:03:54.060> over<00:03:54.239> for<00:03:54.509> about<00:03:54.720> 4<00:03:55.049> 5<00:03:55.680> seconds

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
over and over for about 4 5 seconds

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.610 
over and over for about 4 5 seconds
total<00:03:56.479> but<00:03:57.479> obviously<00:03:58.229> if<00:03:58.379> you're<00:03:58.500> being

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
total but obviously if you're being

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.259 
total but obviously if you're being
attacked<00:03:58.919> by<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> lot<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.400> other<00:03:59.549> targets<00:04:00.030> then

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
attacked by a lot of other targets then

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.159 
attacked by a lot of other targets then
this<00:04:00.419> is<00:04:00.599> somewhat<00:04:01.290> scary<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:03.000> your<00:04:03.810> main<00:04:03.959> goal

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
this is somewhat scary so your main goal

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.050 
this is somewhat scary so your main goal
should<00:04:04.409> be<00:04:04.500> once<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:05.250> finish<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.639> Drake's

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
should be once you finish the Drake's

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.469 
should be once you finish the Drake's

and you have 10 or more stacks on the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.170 
and you have 10 or more stacks on the
brew<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.620> obviously<00:04:42.460> that's<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.729> great<00:04:42.910> time
