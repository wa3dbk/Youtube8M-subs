00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.460
 as mentioned in a past program 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.410
 crime in our beautiful city 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.320
 does not respect even the beings 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.170
 ethereal some time ago I was stripped 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.300
 of an iphone 4s and since then I decided 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.670
 never carry such a device 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.699
 expensive that's how I got a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.939
 huawei phone a 83 50 also 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.220
 known as boulder or rock a name 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.189
 which by its nature he was 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.379
 as a finger ring a paperweight 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 the return is a phone too 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.360
 simple android strap and has keyboard 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 like blackberry but it's definitely a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 device that did not fill 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.269
 needs of our ghost if what 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.489
 only you need is a phone that 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.469
 make calls send messages like 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.839
 whatsapp and normal text and that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.000
 also pull the odd emulator this 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.089
 device meets although with many 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.250
 reservations before such regrettable acquisition 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.350
 and the price premium engine with which 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.059
 they sell the phones in our country 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.159
 the digital drug team was given a 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.960
 task of achieving the impossible get a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.940
 cellular for our ghost that is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 powerful and economical 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.130
 let it work like san google 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.899
 send inter websites and euros 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 the mobiles that are commercialized 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.500
 exclusively for the Chinese market have 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.990
 greatly improved over time 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.299
 We have big name brands like 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 They are Xiaomi and it made me be able to you 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.619
 for you with the greats like samsung but 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.299
 who unfortunately decide to stay in their 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.100
 country of origin and if it is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.590
 exported lose their attractiveness to 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.450
 raise its price due to resale 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.140
 on the other hand we have other brands a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.569
 little less known and more modest as 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.800
 yahoo shop or among others or like in this 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:51.490
 case of age the technology happy life 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.220
 the thw uve 200 is physically a clone 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.110
 of the htc water flight but of entrails 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.290
 rather comparable to those of the samsung 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.690
 galaxy s3 with an approximate cost of 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.540
 three thousand pesos in the Chinese market not 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.720
 has nothing to envy the latter 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.720
 good if perhaps the nfc for those who 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.540
 come to use or the gorilla glass for 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.849
 those who have little stomachs 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.459
 the phone has two slots for 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.560
 chips that work at the same time and you 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.829
 allows you to choose from which line you want 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.709
 that calls or messages like this come out 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.840
 how to deactivate anyone gave away in case 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.810
 you have a line of work and you do not want 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.329
 I felt you bursting in, your life comes 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.189
 with Android 4.2 and the and it lies factory 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.840
 although in our most recent version 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.689
 of the operative works so 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.989
 impeccable and 5 ellis has a screen 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:48.370
 5-inch ips with a resolution of 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.069
 1280 x 720 pixels 8 gb of memory 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.859
 internal a quad-core mediatek processor 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.349
 1.5 GHz Hertz Front Camera 5 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.500
 megapixels and rear camera 8 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.750
 megapixels the weak points of this 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.120
 device would be that the rear camera was 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.370
 slows down when you take photos or videos 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.950
 with low light and the gyroscope sensor 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.790
 has an inverted axis when you place the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.960
 phone upright 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.760
 fortunately both are errors of 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.260
 firmware that can be repaired with 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.100
 an update by the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.430
 manufacturer or with a custom rom 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.870
 if you take into account that thl w200 and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.880
 apart from having a phone name 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.370

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.260
 phone to most people 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.150

 the power of a range device

 medium-high or the price of a range 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.050
