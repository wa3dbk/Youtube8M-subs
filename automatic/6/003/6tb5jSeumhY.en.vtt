style<00:01:06.390> case<00:01:07.380> ninth<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.250> used<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> make

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
style case ninth where they used to make

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
style case ninth where they used to make
them<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> Tomball<00:01:10.890> series

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
them you got to go to the Tomball series

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
them you got to go to the Tomball series
which<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.150> understandable<00:01:12.750> everything<00:01:13.170> goes

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
which is understandable everything goes

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
which is understandable everything goes
up<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.000> anywhere<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
up and that's a anywhere I think it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
up and that's a anywhere I think it
starts<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.860> $300<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> own<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> old

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
starts at $300 so if you own the old

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.820 
starts at $300 so if you own the old
