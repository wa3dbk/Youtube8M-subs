00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.360
 I have again yes I know 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.700
 little problem 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.760
 and yes, there are quite a few right now 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.810
 cool things to wear 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.539
 Of course, now always pull and 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.050
 Although nice new transfer squares 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.160
 new transfer and doumbia city hall drives 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.010

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.530
 he was yesterday to it but we do everything 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.540

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.129
 unfortunately so zeger checks are there he had to 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.570
 then we look, of course, then we have 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.120
 also player of the day 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.940
 namely pascal mario gomez more that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.079
 match and tomovic so really cool 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.550
 things you like to pull naturally 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.899
 other team of the week has it 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.399
 actually only shown and it works 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.449
 of course special picks one 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.930
 pull pendant 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.410

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.899
 otherwise not that things 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.160
 I'm actually interested in that 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.220
 actually now the things you open 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.650
 but to become every case, I think 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.340
 I hope for a political purpose 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.300
 not bad first the special 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.580
 I would say effects 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.760
 Let's start one today 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.480
 hour and I think say flow 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.480
 We all have our eyes 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.190
 we will just close our eyes 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:11.660
 and we have to weak in a short time 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.660
 one was considered celtic 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.400
 No 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.780
 nice 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.849
 now time which begins from the already 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.610
 again good 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:30.650
 short was in the first 30 castle hole I 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.870
 that's something really cool 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.069
 is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.069
 today I would tell you but im 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.900
 The next one of these eyes was pitted 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.680
 was really lucky in the short 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.810
 first pack or first set first mega 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.579
 set is for the second and watch 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:58.940
 Just go or not how it works 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:03:00.430
 pack that's my goodness is already 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:08.689
 again a bit outdated 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:11.079
 he will pick up the course, okay, more 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.079
 value 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:25.890
 kasami and ninetieth pace is not 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.420
 bad but an expect is a lospech 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.079
 So only because I only 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:40.889
 six celebration and one more way 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.889
 brought so neese spec and 14 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:52.919
 I hold the wiso together one 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.919
 Bundestag is then you do not see it 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:19.170
 yes it is all right tiotÃ© beating 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:24.060
 and curling spec this account is running 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:27.650
 In any case, what happened to her 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:34.940
 Sterling 90s is about 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:41.580
 In 2001 , Pater had a value in the next case 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:44.060
 So yes , I think it was hunter 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.870
 around the 10 degrees 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.870
 but I am not sure 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 10 

00:04:54.619 --> 00:05:00.529
 today relate the tooth 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:04.019
 again I think oh oh my god i 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:07.349
 you see that people as all page is 

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:09.709
 fits because I thought that we would like them 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:16.709
 but today , unfortunately, is not 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:19.769
 after all, silver players like him 

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:22.139
 Friends but friends after all that is 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:24.569
 now my second I am not that 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.669
 in fact the only way that can play on 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:32.369
 but this was short stoner 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.169
 what more could you want with the park opening 

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:35.969
 I would say goodbye 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.069
 if you please 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.229
 and I think about wanting that 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.299
 first so by the first but that way 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.119
 match online that I shot now 

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:47.369

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.519
 I'm out skin in until the next one 

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:49.519
