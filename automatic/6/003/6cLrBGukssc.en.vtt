extend to me through outwards so that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.750 
extend to me through outwards so that
you've<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.580> screw

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you've got a little bit of screw

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.750 
you've got a little bit of screw
sticking<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:13.200> screw<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
sticking out then screw I just got the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
sticking out then screw I just got the
whole<00:01:14.909> cable<00:01:15.119> put<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.200> screw<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
whole cable put on there just screw it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.219 
whole cable put on there just screw it
in<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:17.340> grin<00:01:17.520> step<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> should

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
in just grin step that's what it should

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
in just grin step that's what it should
look<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.400> what's<00:01:20.820> not

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
look like this about what's not

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
look like this about what's not
centering<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.689> probably<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.020> five<00:01:22.290> mil<00:01:22.530> 6

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
centering it's probably about five mil 6

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.760 
centering it's probably about five mil 6
ml<00:01:23.330> but<00:01:25.490> I'll<00:01:26.490> show<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.090> now<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.740> try<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
ml but I'll show you here now just try a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.350 
ml but I'll show you here now just try a
bit<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> practice<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:31.460> then<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bit of practice so then it's kind of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
bit of practice so then it's kind of
hard<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> thread<00:01:34.140> scott<00:01:34.470> started<00:01:34.829> once

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
hard to get a thread scott started once

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
hard to get a thread scott started once
you<00:01:35.100> start<00:01:35.340> screwing<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.689> idea<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you start screwing it in the idea of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
you start screwing it in the idea of
putting<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> first<00:01:37.860> time<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.220> taking

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
putting it in the first time then taking

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.749 
putting it in the first time then taking
out<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.990> make<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> easier<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> second<00:01:41.729> time

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
out is to make it easier the second time

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.330 
out is to make it easier the second time
around<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.810> put<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.049> got<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
around to put this in and then got it in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.080 
around to put this in and then got it in
you<00:01:47.340> might<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> put<00:01:47.759> some<00:01:47.790> silicone

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you might want to put some silicone

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.319 
you might want to put some silicone
around<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.140> seal<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:51.000> some

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
around there to seal it up or get some

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.260 
around there to seal it up or get some
heat<00:01:52.320> activated<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.220> shrink<00:01:53.640> wrapping<00:01:53.939> tape

load of other crumpled floor now alright
so<00:03:22.180> that's<00:03:22.299> how<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.480> fix<00:03:22.720> these<00:03:22.900> little

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
so that's how you fix these little

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.800 
so that's how you fix these little
things<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:24.640> probably<00:03:25.269> that's<00:03:25.540> actually

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
things that is probably that's actually

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.880 
things that is probably that's actually
probably<00:03:25.900> right<00:03:26.260> just<00:03:26.530> about<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.769> right

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
probably right just about the right

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.850 
probably right just about the right
length<00:03:27.130> for<00:03:27.400> an<00:03:28.269> engine<00:03:28.630> oh<00:03:31.079> wow<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.380> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
length for an engine oh wow so the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.300 
length for an engine oh wow so the
quarter<00:03:33.280> was<00:03:33.430> down<00:03:33.730> here<00:03:34.060> somewhere<00:03:35.310> that's

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
quarter was down here somewhere that's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.220 
quarter was down here somewhere that's
just<00:03:36.489> about<00:03:36.670> right<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:38.579> that's<00:03:39.579> how<00:03:39.790> we<00:03:39.850> go<00:03:40.230> fix

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
just about right so that's how we go fix

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.390 
just about right so that's how we go fix
yeah<00:03:41.850> standard<00:03:42.850> little<00:03:44.100> ignition<00:03:45.100> blow<00:03:45.250> this

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
yeah standard little ignition blow this

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.890 
yeah standard little ignition blow this
up<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.780> can<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.079> on<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.470> about<00:03:47.680> any

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
up this you can do on just about any

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.229 
up this you can do on just about any
small<00:03:49.900> equation<00:03:50.290> call<00:03:50.440> like<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
small equation call like this but you

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.759 
small equation call like this but you
need<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.510> make<00:03:52.690> sure<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.079> get<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.380> bit<00:03:53.620> here

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
need to make sure you get this bit here

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.319 
need to make sure you get this bit here
right<00:03:54.040> otherwise<00:03:54.370> afford<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.820> gets<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.180> there

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
right otherwise afford to gets in there

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.759 
right otherwise afford to gets in there
the<00:03:55.450> connections<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.049> there<00:03:56.260> will<00:03:56.410> corrode

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
the connections in there will corrode

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.300 
the connections in there will corrode
and<00:03:57.100> see<00:03:57.970> all<00:03:58.120> those<00:03:58.209> spark<00:03:59.040> even<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.160> it's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
and see all those spark even if it's

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.819 
and see all those spark even if it's
just<00:04:00.370> noise<00:04:00.700> job<00:04:01.030> even<00:04:01.269> if<00:04:01.450> Bobby<00:04:02.170> Day<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.620> fog

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
just noise job even if Bobby Day and fog

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.330 
just noise job even if Bobby Day and fog
gets<00:04:03.040> into<00:04:03.489> where<00:04:03.820> it's<00:04:04.120> stored<00:04:04.329> like<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.570> chef

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
gets into where it's stored like a chef

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.619 
gets into where it's stored like a chef
you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.180> screw<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.569> so<00:04:08.180> good<00:04:09.180> luck<00:04:09.360> if<00:04:09.510> you

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
you can screw it up so good luck if you

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.590 
you can screw it up so good luck if you
dry<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.870> see<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.470> later
