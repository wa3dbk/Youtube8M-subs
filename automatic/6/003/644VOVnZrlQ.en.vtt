00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
I mean they're all running track the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.720 
I mean they're all running track the
touch

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
touch

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.640 
touch
I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.870 

research<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.740> do<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.190> androids<00:03:15.550> finally

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
research to do that and androids finally

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.670 
research to do that and androids finally
catching<00:03:16.150> up<00:03:16.240> with<00:03:16.330> all<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.510> stuff<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.020> Sony

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680

I<00:03:17.830> mean<00:03:17.950> their<00:03:18.069> interface<00:03:18.550> is<00:03:18.700> really

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
I mean their interface is really

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.850 
I mean their interface is really
primitive<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.480> honest<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:23.080> we're<00:03:23.620> talking

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
primitive to be honest so we're talking

a<00:03:46.550> Macintosh<00:03:49.730> well<00:03:50.730> we<00:03:50.849> will<00:03:51.000> that's<00:03:51.209> one<00:03:51.360> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
a Macintosh well we will that's one of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.580 
a Macintosh well we will that's one of
the<00:03:51.510> reasons<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:51.870> wouldn't<00:03:52.110> let<00:03:52.170> us<00:03:52.230> go<00:03:52.440> in

with<00:03:52.709> microphones<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.340> believe<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.790> they

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
with microphones I believe is that they

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.910 
with microphones I believe is that they
didn't<00:03:54.569> want<00:03:54.629> us<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.930> ask<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.379> question
