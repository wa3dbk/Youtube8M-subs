hey<00:00:00.179> guys<00:00:00.359> so<00:00:00.630> today<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:00.930> want<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.199> compare<00:00:01.469> the

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hey guys so today I want to compare the

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey guys so today I want to compare the
galaxy<00:00:02.070> grant<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> little<00:00:03.060> bit<00:00:03.179> against<00:00:03.600> the

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
galaxy grant to a little bit against the

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.590 
galaxy grant to a little bit against the
galaxy<00:00:04.259> s5<00:00:04.710> so<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> know<00:00:05.730> these<00:00:06.060> devices

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
galaxy s5 so I know these devices

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.250 
galaxy s5 so I know these devices
doesn't<00:00:06.930> cost<00:00:07.550> around<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.970> same<00:00:09.210> but<00:00:10.139> it

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
doesn't cost around the same but it

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.200 
doesn't cost around the same but it
still<00:00:10.440> could<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.769> some<00:00:11.190> fun<00:00:11.460> things<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.030> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
still could be some fun things here to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.789 
still could be some fun things here to
compare<00:00:12.570> them<00:00:12.750> because<00:00:13.080> some<00:00:13.469> people<00:00:13.769> are

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
compare them because some people are

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.680 
compare them because some people are
interested<00:00:14.219> some<00:00:14.790> people<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.210> want<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.509> see

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
interested some people just want to see

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.269 
interested some people just want to see
what<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.740> different<00:00:17.570> comparing<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.949> galaxy<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
what it's different comparing a galaxy a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.970 
what it's different comparing a galaxy a
high-end<00:00:20.760> galaxy<00:00:21.240> device<00:00:21.359> versus<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.830> like

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
high-end galaxy device versus a can like

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.960 
high-end galaxy device versus a can like
mid-range<00:00:23.490> galaxy<00:00:24.180> device<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> some<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
mid-range galaxy device so some of the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.650 
mid-range galaxy device so some of the
first<00:00:27.180> key<00:00:27.750> things<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:29.090> that<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> different

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
first key things here that is different

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
first key things here that is different
and<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.769> say<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.790> if

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and that I can say all right now is if

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120 
and that I can say all right now is if
we<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> different<00:00:33.960> display<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.590> they

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we do have a different display and they

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.729 
we do have a different display and they
are<00:00:35.219> almost<00:00:35.399> identical<00:00:35.820> size<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.870> which<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
are almost identical size here which is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.130 
are almost identical size here which is
come<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.640> mean<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.660> take<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:40.050> up

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
come from I mean when we take them up

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
come from I mean when we take them up
here<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> ohms

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
here you can kind of see that the ohms

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.000 
here you can kind of see that the ohms
identical<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.469> side<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.890> do

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
identical I see on the left side we do

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.479 
identical I see on the left side we do
have<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.399> galaxy<00:00:44.940> grand<00:00:45.329> 2<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> also

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
have the galaxy grand 2 and we can also

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.430 
have the galaxy grand 2 and we can also
see<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> material<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.289> actually

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
see the material here I was actually

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
see the material here I was actually
quite<00:00:49.860> priced<00:00:50.430> how<00:00:51.030> good<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.780> galaxy<00:00:52.500> grand<00:00:52.649> 2

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
quite priced how good the galaxy grand 2

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.119 
quite priced how good the galaxy grand 2
felt<00:00:53.719> because<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.230> using<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
felt because it's using this kind of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
felt because it's using this kind of
letter<00:00:56.309> material<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> Galaxy<00:00:57.600> Note<00:00:57.750> 3

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
letter material that the Galaxy Note 3

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.799 
letter material that the Galaxy Note 3
also<00:00:58.530> comes<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> used<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.570> mean

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
also comes with and used because I mean

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
also comes with and used because I mean
I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.379> galaxy<00:01:01.680> s5<00:01:01.920> didn't<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
I think the galaxy s5 didn't get this

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
I think the galaxy s5 didn't get this
because<00:01:03.110> it's<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> waterproof<00:01:04.979> phone

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
because it's like a waterproof phone

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.820 
because it's like a waterproof phone
this<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> course<00:01:06.119> isn't<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.590> water

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this one of course isn't or it's a water

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
this one of course isn't or it's a water
assistant<00:01:08.340> phone<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.630> handle<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
assistant phone it can handle that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.350 
assistant phone it can handle that
pretty<00:01:10.380> well<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.729> feels<00:01:11.820> Barbara

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
pretty well but this just feels Barbara

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.710 
pretty well but this just feels Barbara
quality<00:01:12.810> doesn't<00:01:13.020> find<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.710> feel<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.030> same<00:01:15.330> as

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
quality doesn't find it feel the same as

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
quality doesn't find it feel the same as
my<00:01:16.790> Galaxy<00:01:17.790> Note<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.509> Galaxy<00:01:19.229> Note<00:01:19.350> 3<00:01:19.409> see

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
my Galaxy Note the Galaxy Note 3 see

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
my Galaxy Note the Galaxy Note 3 see
this<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> feels<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:22.680> like

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
this one it feels a little bit more like

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
this one it feels a little bit more like
more<00:01:23.430> quality<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.000> more<00:01:24.570> real<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.020> think

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
more quality I think more real I think

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.469 
more quality I think more real I think
that<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> black<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.549> does<00:01:26.759> compared<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that this black it does compared to this

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.520 
that this black it does compared to this
one<00:01:28.159> which<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.520> pretty<00:01:29.790> interesting

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
one which is pretty pretty interesting

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.219 
one which is pretty pretty interesting
so<00:01:31.530> another<00:01:32.100> thing<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.479> notice<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
so another thing here that I notice is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
so another thing here that I notice is
that<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.530> feels<00:01:34.740> pretty<00:01:34.950> thick<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that it feels pretty thick and the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.770 
that it feels pretty thick and the
galaxy<00:01:36.780> grand<00:01:37.310> has<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> thick<00:01:39.299> design

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
galaxy grand has a like a thick design

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.789 
galaxy grand has a like a thick design
to<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.720> pretty<00:01:43.290> interesting<00:01:43.500> I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to it which is pretty interesting I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
to it which is pretty interesting I'm
going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> say<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.939> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> feels<00:01:45.479> badass<00:01:45.869> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
going to say it kind of feels badass I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.380 
going to say it kind of feels badass I
think<00:01:46.229> feels<00:01:46.740> very<00:01:47.420> nicely<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:48.990> hand

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
think feels very nicely in your hand

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.120 
think feels very nicely in your hand
versus<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> galaxy's<00:01:51.960> file<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.470> feels<00:01:52.710> way

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
versus the galaxy's file which feels way

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.109 
versus the galaxy's file which feels way
lighter<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.880> way<00:01:54.180> thinner<00:01:54.979> I<00:01:55.979> don't<00:01:56.850> like

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
lighter and way thinner I don't like

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
lighter and way thinner I don't like
this<00:01:57.659> kind<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.930> book<00:01:58.200> design<00:01:58.790> on<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.439> galaxy

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
this kind of book design on the galaxy

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
this kind of book design on the galaxy
s5<00:02:02.299> versus<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.869> clean<00:02:04.649> look<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
s5 versus more of a clean look here that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
like in plastic so that may not matter

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.930

too<00:02:13.250> much

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
too much

this<00:03:04.100> low<00:03:04.310> side<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.420> definitely<00:03:05.540> be

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
this low side so that can definitely be

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.100 
this low side so that can definitely be
fun<00:03:06.620> things<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.310> know<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.750> mean<00:03:08.900> yes

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
fun things there to know and I mean yes

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.410 
fun things there to know and I mean yes
if<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.440> bring<00:03:09.680> up<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.190> area<00:03:10.489> for<00:03:10.880> example<00:03:11.330> you

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
if we bring up this area for example you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.170 
if we bring up this area for example you
can<00:03:11.569> see<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.900> there's<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.670> super<00:03:13.670> big<00:03:13.910> big

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.120 
720p over there which it looks so so
much<00:03:47.690> better<00:03:47.750> it's<00:03:48.230> pretty<00:03:48.560> amazing<00:03:48.769> actually

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
much better it's pretty amazing actually

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.120 
much better it's pretty amazing actually
how<00:03:49.519> much<00:03:49.730> better<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.780> looks<00:03:50.959> from<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.859> sides

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
how much better it looks from the sides

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.640 
how much better it looks from the sides
and<00:03:52.700> all<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.209> something<00:03:54.109> really<00:03:54.200> nice<00:03:54.440> what

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
and all that something really nice what

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.220 
and all that something really nice what
they're<00:03:54.799> doing<00:03:55.160> here<00:03:55.910> 500<00:03:56.660> inches<00:03:56.810> play

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
versus 525 inch display here so it's

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.000 
versus 525 inch display here so it's
actually<00:03:59.750> bigger<00:04:00.049> on<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.290> gas<00:04:00.440> here<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.829> you

actually bigger on the gas here and you

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.949 
actually bigger on the gas here and you
can<00:04:01.190> probably<00:04:01.730> also<00:04:01.910> hear<00:04:02.209> up<00:04:02.329> here<00:04:02.569> that<00:04:02.810> on

only comes in a TA vice variant but

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.699 
only comes in a TA vice variant but
eight<00:04:16.159> gigabytes<00:04:16.640> still

on<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.610> galaxy<00:05:22.090> s5<00:05:22.419> so<00:05:23.080> that's<00:05:23.710> pretty<00:05:24.250> sweet

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
on the galaxy s5 so that's pretty sweet

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.330 
on the galaxy s5 so that's pretty sweet
actually<00:05:24.669> for<00:05:24.970> mid-range<00:05:25.180> device<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.340> some

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
actually for mid-range device and some

actually for mid-range device and some
other<00:05:27.550> things<00:05:27.880> here<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.690> do<00:05:28.840> get<00:05:28.990> quad-core

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
other things here you do get quad-core

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.890 
other things here you do get quad-core

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
it's a 7 which is not super impressive

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.249 
it's a 7 which is not super impressive
athletes<00:06:00.280> it's<00:06:00.669> pretty<00:06:01.060> can<00:06:01.750> be<00:06:01.870> pretty<00:06:02.080> bad

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
athletes it's pretty can be pretty bad

they<00:06:07.990> had<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.199> one<00:06:08.320> that<00:06:08.530> this<00:06:08.710> going<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:08.949> kill

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
they had the one that this going to kill

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
they had the one that this going to kill
more<00:06:09.490> dairy<00:06:09.789> is<00:06:10.120> going<00:06:10.659> to<00:06:10.870> be<00:06:11.699> the<00:06:12.699> galaxy's

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
more dairy is going to be the galaxy's

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.610 
more dairy is going to be the galaxy's
far<00:06:13.449> clearly<00:06:13.750> it's<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.080> major<00:06:14.349> major

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
far clearly it's a major major

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.580 
far clearly it's a major major
difference<00:06:15.039> between<00:06:15.159> 305<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.120> 3mm<00:06:16.750> 30<00:06:17.259> but

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
difference between 305 and 3mm 30 but

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.969 
difference between 305 and 3mm 30 but
305<00:06:18.250> can<00:06:18.520> still<00:06:18.759> handle<00:06:19.330> a<00:06:19.539> lot<00:06:19.690> of<00:06:19.810> games<00:06:20.020> so

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
305 can still handle a lot of games so

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.830 
305 can still handle a lot of games so
you<00:06:21.039> better<00:06:21.580> check<00:06:21.880> that<00:06:21.909> out<00:06:22.210> especially<00:06:22.539> if

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
you better check that out especially if

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.860 
you better check that out especially if
they<00:06:22.930> are<00:06:22.960> optimized<00:06:23.530> that<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.979> can<00:06:24.190> be<00:06:24.310> really

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
they are optimized that it can be really

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.879 
they are optimized that it can be really
nice<00:06:25.870> experience<00:06:26.229> actually

you<00:06:39.590> do<00:06:39.770> get<00:06:39.949> some<00:06:40.249> special<00:06:40.939> features<00:06:41.889> inside

you do get some special features inside

basically<00:06:51.979> in<00:06:52.219> the<00:06:52.550> window<00:06:52.909> here<00:06:53.090> but<00:06:53.270> then

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
basically in the window here but then

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.269 
basically in the window here but then
again<00:06:53.509> there's<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.930> lot<00:06:54.110> of<00:06:54.169> apps<00:06:54.379> that<00:06:54.650> can<00:06:54.770> do

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
again there's a lot of apps that can do

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.529 
again there's a lot of apps that can do
similar<00:06:55.580> things<00:06:55.810> probably<00:06:56.810> for<00:06:57.499> you<00:06:58.129> and<00:06:58.539> so

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
similar things probably for you and so

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.879 
similar things probably for you and so
you<00:06:59.629> can<00:06:59.810> kind<00:07:00.050> of<00:07:00.169> get<00:07:00.289> a<00:07:00.319> little<00:07:00.469> bit<00:07:00.620> of<00:07:00.800> that

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 
you can kind of get a little bit of that

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.409 
you can kind of get a little bit of that
experience<00:07:01.279> on<00:07:01.520> the<00:07:01.610> icy<00:07:01.759> ground<00:07:01.939> too<00:07:02.240> but

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:23.089 
like what you pay but this one is a

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:27.839 
like what you pay but this one is a
little<00:07:23.360> bit<00:07:23.569> underpowered<00:07:23.930> @dm<00:07:25.389> the<00:07:26.389> grand<00:07:26.870> -

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849 
little bit underpowered @dm the grand -

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:30.700 
little bit underpowered @dm the grand -
it's<00:07:28.849> a<00:07:28.969> nice<00:07:29.180> device<00:07:29.539> but<00:07:29.900> the<00:07:30.229> core<00:07:30.439> core

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
it's a nice device but the core core

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.189 
it's a nice device but the core core
processor<00:07:31.249> is<00:07:31.460> not<00:07:31.669> super<00:07:32.150> good<00:07:32.300> at<00:07:32.539> one

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
processor is not super good at one

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.749 
processor is not super good at one
particular<00:07:33.469> hurts<00:07:33.860> especially<00:07:34.250> for<00:07:34.699> the

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 
particular hurts especially for the

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830 
price you pay for this one and you

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.320 
price you pay for this one and you
