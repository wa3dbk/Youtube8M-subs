Celsius<00:00:22.400> considering<00:00:23.400> she<00:00:23.550> doesn't<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
Celsius considering she doesn't have a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.230 
Celsius considering she doesn't have a
humidifier<00:00:24.470> now<00:00:25.490> honestly<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:26.970> do

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
humidifier now honestly I don't do

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.390 
humidifier now honestly I don't do
anything<00:00:27.570> special<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.039> course<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
anything special for them of course in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160 
anything special for them of course in
the<00:00:29.490> winter<00:00:29.580> time<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.210> more<00:00:30.449> humidity<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the winter time I have more humidity and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.959 
the winter time I have more humidity and
probably<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:31.769> will<00:00:31.920> pick<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.189> more<00:00:32.640> humidity

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
probably they will pick up more humidity

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.450 
probably they will pick up more humidity
than<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> summertime<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.290> wintertime<00:00:35.219> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
than in the summertime so wintertime is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
than in the summertime so wintertime is
okay<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> summertime<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
okay for them but in the summertime I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
okay for them but in the summertime I
don't<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> humidifier<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
don't have a humidifier in this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
don't have a humidifier in this
particular<00:00:40.350> area<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:41.129> Phalaenopsis

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
particular area because Phalaenopsis

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
particular area because Phalaenopsis
don't<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.059> need<00:00:42.329> too<00:00:42.719> much<00:00:42.840> humidity<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.620> do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
don't really need too much humidity I do

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
don't really need too much humidity I do
miss<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> guess

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
miss them from time to time so I guess

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
miss them from time to time so I guess
the<00:00:46.350> aerial<00:00:46.649> roots<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.190> missed<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the aerial roots get missed it when I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
the aerial roots get missed it when I
missed<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.840> orchids<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.370> don't

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
missed my orchids but I really don't

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510 
missed my orchids but I really don't
know<00:00:50.850> crazy<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.899> misting<00:00:52.680> every<00:00:52.980> day<00:00:53.190> these

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
know crazy about misting every day these

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
know crazy about misting every day these
aerial<00:00:54.030> roots<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.500> adapted

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
aerial roots they actually have adapted

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
aerial roots they actually have adapted
some<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.879> orchids<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:58.170> really

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
some of my orchids have really really

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.790 
some of my orchids have really really
crazy<00:00:58.770> aerial<00:00:59.430> roots<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
crazy aerial roots as you can see and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
crazy aerial roots as you can see and
they<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:01.829> grow<00:01:02.309> whenever<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> growing

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
they will grow whenever the growing

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420 
they will grow whenever the growing
season<00:01:03.719> starts<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.710> stop<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.250> take

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
season starts and they will stop or take

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
season starts and they will stop or take
a<00:01:05.460> break<00:01:05.729> whenever<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.170> bloom

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
a break whenever you are get is in bloom

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.910 
a break whenever you are get is in bloom
and<00:01:08.180> yeah<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.900> fertilized<00:01:10.409> whenever<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and yeah they get fertilized whenever I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
and yeah they get fertilized whenever I
fertilize<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.610> kid<00:01:11.970> whenever<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.330> water<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
fertilize your kid whenever I water the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
fertilize your kid whenever I water the
orchid<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.500> more<00:01:13.770> water<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.460> other

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
orchid they get more water but other

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210 
orchid they get more water but other
than<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.360> don't<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:16.140> crazy<00:01:16.470> now

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
than that I really don't go crazy now

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
than that I really don't go crazy now
regarding<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:17.970> environment<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.229> it's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
regarding your environment I think it's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
regarding your environment I think it's
a<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:20.070> good<00:01:20.340> environment<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:20.880> Phalaenopsis

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
a very good environment for Phalaenopsis

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
a very good environment for Phalaenopsis
they<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.439> temperature<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
they really like that temperature and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640 
they really like that temperature and
the<00:01:23.640> 40<00:01:23.909> percent<00:01:24.240> humidity<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.380> not

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the 40 percent humidity is actually not

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
the 40 percent humidity is actually not
that<00:01:25.860> low<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> filling<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.790> OPS's<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that low for a filling in OPS's so I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
that low for a filling in OPS's so I
think<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:28.920> well<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.549> any

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
think they will do pretty well in any

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
think they will do pretty well in any
case<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.500> aerial<00:01:31.860> roots

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
case if you see that the aerial roots

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.429 
case if you see that the aerial roots
get<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.790> wrinkly<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.720> start<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> miss

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
get really wrinkly you can start to miss

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
get really wrinkly you can start to miss
them<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.520> wouldn't<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.180> crazy

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
them but I really wouldn't go that crazy

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
them but I really wouldn't go that crazy
about<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.560> wouldn't<00:01:37.829> worry<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
about it I really wouldn't worry that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.080 
about it I really wouldn't worry that
much<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> orchid<00:01:40.110> has<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.950> most<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
much because the orchid has the most of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
much because the orchid has the most of
its<00:01:42.329> roots<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.229> pot<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.920> get

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
its roots in the pot and they do get

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.179 
its roots in the pot and they do get
water<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.049> hydration<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.710> hydrate

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
water and hydration and they can hydrate

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.120 
water and hydration and they can hydrate
the<00:01:47.820> orchid<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> answer<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.590> exact

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the orchid so to answer to your exact

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
the orchid so to answer to your exact
question<00:01:50.520> which<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.509> how<00:01:51.810> long<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.619> actually

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
question which is how long they actually

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.940 
question which is how long they actually
last<00:01:53.280> without<00:01:53.640> being<00:01:53.939> missed<00:01:54.439> well<00:01:55.439> honestly

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
last without being missed well honestly

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
last without being missed well honestly
I<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.790> some<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> these<00:01:57.390> roots<00:01:57.630> never

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I don't know some of these roots never

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.340 
I don't know some of these roots never
saw<00:01:58.229> water<00:01:59.210> because<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.020> know<00:02:01.110> they're<00:02:01.320> just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
saw water because you know they're just

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
saw water because you know they're just
so<00:02:01.649> long<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.399> when<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.579> soak<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> pot<00:02:03.360> some<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so long that when I soak the pot some of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
so long that when I soak the pot some of
them<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.829> water<00:02:05.070> at<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
them really don't get water at all so I

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
them really don't get water at all so I
guess<00:02:06.450> they're<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.689> designed<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.469> absorb

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
guess they're just designed to absorb

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.070 
guess they're just designed to absorb
any<00:02:08.009> amount<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.489> moisture

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
any amount of moisture

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.640 
any amount of moisture
that's<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.710> air<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.690> yeah<00:02:12.260> they<00:02:12.440> can

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
that's in the air so yeah they can

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.130 
that's in the air so yeah they can
actually<00:02:12.800> last<00:02:13.250> indefinitely<00:02:14.120> even<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
actually last indefinitely even in the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.490 
actually last indefinitely even in the
summertime<00:02:15.880> every<00:02:16.880> bit<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.180> water<00:02:18.110> every

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
summertime every bit of water every

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.090 
summertime every bit of water every
droplet<00:02:18.890> every<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.320> moisture<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
droplet every you know moisture in the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.470 
droplet every you know moisture in the
air<00:02:22.250> they<00:02:22.520> will<00:02:22.640> pick<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:22.970> up<00:02:23.150> actually

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
air they will pick it up actually

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.990 
air they will pick it up actually
because<00:02:24.050> that's<00:02:24.290> what<00:02:24.620> they're<00:02:25.130> made<00:02:25.160> for

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
because that's what they're made for

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.640 
because that's what they're made for
so<00:02:26.420> yeah<00:02:27.400> yeah<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.430> know<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:29.300> did<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> sort<00:02:30.530> of
