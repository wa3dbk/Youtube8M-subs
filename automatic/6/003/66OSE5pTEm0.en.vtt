and<00:00:05.680> here<00:00:05.830> we<00:00:05.950> are<00:00:05.980> back<00:00:06.100> ready<00:00:06.580> to<00:00:06.670> make<00:00:06.880> our

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
and here we are back ready to make our

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.600 
and here we are back ready to make our
first<00:00:07.330> hole<00:00:07.689> shell<00:00:08.109> for<00:00:08.920> the<00:00:08.980> winding<00:00:09.309> lane

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
first hole shell for the winding lane

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.610 
first hole shell for the winding lane
bracelet<00:00:10.000> to<00:00:10.450> do<00:00:10.570> this<00:00:10.719> we<00:00:10.929> need<00:00:10.960> to<00:00:11.110> forward

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
bracelet to do this we need to forward

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.650 
bracelet to do this we need to forward
loop<00:00:11.950> chain<00:00:12.420> six<00:00:13.420> and<00:00:15.090> the<00:00:16.090> reason<00:00:16.390> that<00:00:16.480> we're

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
loop chain six and the reason that we're

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.970 
loop chain six and the reason that we're
putting<00:00:18.390> half<00:00:19.390> shells<00:00:19.779> at<00:00:20.140> either<00:00:20.439> end<00:00:20.770> of<00:00:20.860> the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.100 
putting half shells at either end of the
bracelet<00:00:21.430> is<00:00:21.759> to<00:00:22.390> control<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:23.400> waviness<00:00:25.110> so

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
bracelet is to control the waviness so

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.959 
bracelet is to control the waviness so
that<00:00:26.349> no<00:00:26.559> matter<00:00:26.710> how<00:00:27.009> many<00:00:27.189> scallops<00:00:27.790> you

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:27.969 
that no matter how many scallops you

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.660 
that no matter how many scallops you
make<00:00:28.239> the<00:00:29.169> ends<00:00:29.500> will<00:00:29.649> always<00:00:30.070> meet<00:00:31.290> perfectly

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.670

anchor the beads and you now have your
first<00:01:34.390> whole<00:01:35.080> show<00:01:35.440> let's<00:01:35.890> go<00:01:36.070> on<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.340> make

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
first whole show let's go on and make

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.870 
first whole show let's go on and make

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
one more shell before I skip ahead to

one more shell before I skip ahead to
the<00:01:40.090> end<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> bracelet<00:01:41.700> six<00:01:43.439> forward<00:01:44.439> loop

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
the end of the bracelet six forward loop

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
the end of the bracelet six forward loop
chains

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.990 

and<00:01:52.450> again<00:01:52.900> we<00:01:53.050> always<00:01:53.440> treat<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.700> last

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
and again we always treat the last

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120 
and again we always treat the last
forward<00:01:55.840> loop<00:01:56.110> chain<00:01:56.380> as<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.800> turning<00:01:57.100> chain

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
forward loop chain as the turning chain

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.820 
forward loop chain as the turning chain
so<00:01:57.730> we're<00:01:58.390> going<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.780> yarn<00:01:59.020> over<00:01:59.230> pick<00:01:59.620> up<00:01:59.650> a

so we're going to yarn over pick up a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.230 
so we're going to yarn over pick up a
loop<00:02:00.010> in<00:02:00.160> each<00:02:00.430> of<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.870> previous<00:02:01.990> five<00:02:03.570> one

two<00:02:08.460> three<00:02:10.590> four<00:02:12.300> five<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.930> then<00:02:14.850> we<00:02:15.850> want<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
two three four five and then we want to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.960 
two three four five and then we want to
anchor<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> previous<00:02:17.080> shell<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> turn

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
anchor it to the previous shell so turn

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.690 
anchor it to the previous shell so turn
