00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:06.100
 there is a boy and this is a trick for 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.839
 those who wear glasses even if in 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.170
 actually a make up that I love and that 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.059
 so you can all start the 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.799
 my video for vogue eyewear these are 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.840
 the glasses I wear today have 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.150
 these beautiful colors that they are 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.650
 going very much this spring 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.390
 summer also this fantasy 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.910
 small strips have been seen very much on the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.380
 catwalks if you have seen then start 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.930
 I didn't show you my makeup but 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.840
 it is a cream concealer and I apply it 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.850
 with the brush duo fibers for an effect 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.130
 more natural to the sun for good on all 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.579
 imperfections on the contour area 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.980
 eyes on the sides of the nose and then passed to the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.200
 foundation the obligation as usual 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.610
 that my sponge always dampened 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 dampened I recommend it because the effect 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.079
 it's more natural then it doesn't suck 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.440
 too much product I'm not going to serve 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.350
 too much produced the smoke I respect it for 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.960
 well down towards the neck and then fix it 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.149
 with my face powder this is a powder 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.210
 to one says peter suicide you know use 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.159
 almost always 52 cinemas in the summer yet 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.830
 more because they give a compline effect 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.400
 life 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.680
 they are perfect and then primed this prime 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.270
 and rocchi I go to tapping on all 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.520
 the eyelid is the step to the eye shadows 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.180
 the one who uses a very clear eye shadow 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 and an illuminant because with a trick 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.350
 for those who wear glasses to the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.020
 Dark eye shadows can be a little bit 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.940
 too exaggerated can weigh it down 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 look so I wo n't be too much color 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.060
 study and vague later with a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.370
 light brown I go to score instead 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.550
 the fold to give depth to the 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.320
 look I bring the brownish up 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.340
 at the beginning of the eye then also towards 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.110
 the outside on the outside corner then always 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.530
 of the same palette I take this that 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.900
 a glittery bronze and very shimmer e 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.450
 very summery this but I think I go 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.300
 to apply it over the entire eyelid 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.060
 I go mobile and then blend it well with 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 brown 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.829
 in the fold always from the palette I go to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.079
 take a slightly darker brown 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.720
 Also this and a lot of letters and 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.349
 I apply only on the outside of the eyelid 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.170
 mobile 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.610
 this too I am going to blend it well 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.400
 with the rest of the colors in a way not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.319
 there have been too obvious and then it 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.450
 same color the same brownish it 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.550
 I also wear games on my eyelashes 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.410
 lower I'm not going to create a line 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.060
 too much I recommend myself because with 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.360
 the lenses of the glasses to consecrate 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940
 bigger can create a tra below 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.060
 then we don't like the eye 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.880
 I'm going to blend everything well with a 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 clean and soft brush now not me 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.130
 all we have to do is switch to eyeliner 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.620
 trick use an eyeliner that stands 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.050
 well with the color of the frames 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.060
 glasses then me 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.820
 one purple which by the way as well 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.560
 you know according to color theory to 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.330
 the eyes also stand out a lot 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.160
 green instead a usual alternative i 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.260
 dark eyes could be an eyeliner 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.350
 Friday I like very much with him 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.710
 hazel eyes and then yes I go to 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.140
 spend my channel across the board 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.510
 in short, the lashes making it a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.390
 little more often as usual verse 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.910
 the end on the hill and then the color 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.280
 from the outside just continuous the line is 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.350
 the opposite also on the tops of Ferioli also 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.620
 here I recommend a very long line 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.900
 thin I try to go as much as possible 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.090
 close to eyelashes possible for non 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.820
 cover the brown and then with the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.980
 first brush I go and it also fades 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.240
 the farmhouse always facing outwards towards 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300
 up 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.100
 then he passed strictly to the black pencil 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.710
 black pencil inside the rhyme 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.740
 because we use a viola could do 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.540
 look more like the eyes than not 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.700
 rossati so I never like to dare but 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.580
 all purple inside the eye e 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.370
 then spread the black pencil also on the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.010
 upper rhyme you saw and then passed 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.709
 to the mascara I spread it on the lashes 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.300
 lower I do not go too abundant 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.280
 always for the same reason because with 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.720
 glasses could create a work 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.030
 a little too much I am pronounced and then 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.950
 a on the upper lashes not applied 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.350
 the farmer because all extension online 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.840
 They would all dance forever and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.910
 then I go to fill the eyebrows with 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.190
 a pencil of the color of mine 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.410
 eyebrows naturally I fill up 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.410
 all empty spaces 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.350
 and now all I have to do is comb my hair 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.210
 I always comb upwards and then like that 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.940
 doing I also go to blur the matica 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.370
 so all seems more natural then blush 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.170
 this is a beautiful packaging 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.890
 among other things, I am going to apply blush 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.430
 on the planks up to the base of the 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.280
 hair 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.360
 always near the ear towards the 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.659
 bass 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.440
 ennio blasco I would say more natural and then the 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:09.509
 step to the lipstick this is a splendid one 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.030
 very natural is neither too light 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.820
 too dark so everyone is fine 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.770
 the Turks need very little 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.770
 apply them on the lips 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.380
 evola this is our result 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.240
 final our right for glasses 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.949
 let me know in the comments if there is 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.009
 liked I recommend 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.370
 I send you a mega I do 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.370
 to the next
