00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.200
 the regional and argentina 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.360
 one of them was identified 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.210
 he acted correctly 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 or the first 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.510
 she would have died as a result of the possible lack of responsibility 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.080

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.649
