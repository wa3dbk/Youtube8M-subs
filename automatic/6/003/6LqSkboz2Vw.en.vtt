00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
my name is marcin I study mechanical

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.070 
my name is marcin I study mechanical
engineering

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
engineering

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:13.640 
engineering
I<00:00:08.630> like<00:00:09.630> visits<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.950> science<00:00:11.460> since<00:00:12.650> primary

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
I like visits in science since primary

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.720 
I like visits in science since primary
school<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:16.220> mechanical<00:00:17.220> engineering<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
school and mechanical engineering is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.660 
school and mechanical engineering is
about<00:00:17.850> mechanics<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.900> physics<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
about mechanics and physics and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
about mechanics and physics and
basically<00:00:20.670> all<00:00:21.000> technologies<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> do

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
basically all technologies have to do

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.210 
basically all technologies have to do
mechanical<00:00:23.039> engineering<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:25.010> really<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
mechanical engineering so I really I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.800 
mechanical engineering so I really I
really<00:00:26.460> enjoy

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
applied and got the scholarship to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.280 
applied and got the scholarship to
Malaysia<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.180> had<00:00:43.330> had<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:44.020> choose<00:00:44.260> between

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
Malaysia and I had had to choose between

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.869 
Malaysia and I had had to choose between
many<00:00:45.070> University<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.710> two<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.309> them<00:00:48.520> came

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
many University and to two of them came

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.570 
many University and to two of them came
to<00:00:48.940> my<00:00:49.180> mind<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.660> was<00:00:49.840> Monash<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.340> Curtin

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
to my mind one was Monash and Curtin

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.619 
to my mind one was Monash and Curtin
so<00:00:52.270> at<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.750> end<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:53.519> researched<00:00:54.519> found<00:00:55.480> out

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
so at the end I researched found out

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.520 
so at the end I researched found out
curtains<00:00:55.900> engineering<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.949> better<00:00:57.790> so<00:00:58.530> chose

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
curtains engineering is better so chose

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.370 
curtains engineering is better so chose
Curtin<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.989> end<00:01:02.110> of<00:01:02.199> my<00:01:02.290> second<00:01:02.739> year<00:01:02.769> I

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
Curtin at the end of my second year I

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.600 
Curtin at the end of my second year I
will<00:01:05.380> be<00:01:05.850> transferring<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.119> Perth<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:09.369> the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
will be transferring to Perth and do the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.460 
will be transferring to Perth and do the
second<00:01:10.119> two<00:01:10.210> years<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.660> I<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:17.020> employers

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
second two years and I think employers

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.279 
second two years and I think employers
nowadays<00:01:17.979> are<00:01:18.369> seeking<00:01:18.640> not<00:01:19.539> only<00:01:19.810> good

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
nowadays are seeking not only good

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.990 
nowadays are seeking not only good
students<00:01:21.039> with<00:01:22.030> good<00:01:22.539> academics<00:01:23.140> but<00:01:23.380> also

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
students with good academics but also

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560 
students with good academics but also
good<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.990> shows<00:01:26.229> how<00:01:26.500> involved<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.759> student<00:01:28.240> is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
good it shows how involved a student is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.930 
good it shows how involved a student is
and<00:01:28.810> how<00:01:29.470> much<00:01:29.619> student<00:01:30.280> cares<00:01:30.490> about<00:01:30.759> their

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
and how much student cares about their

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.789 
and how much student cares about their
community<00:01:31.619> which<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:33.300> succeeded<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.799> real

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
community which and succeeded a real

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.860 
community which and succeeded a real
project<00:01:36.400> before<00:01:36.640> graduating

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.530 

I<00:01:41.990> see<00:01:42.980> myself<00:01:43.220> I'm<00:01:44.890> leading<00:01:46.270> managing<00:01:47.270> a

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
I see myself I'm leading managing a

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.950 
I see myself I'm leading managing a
company<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.370> started<00:01:50.270> up<00:01:52.960> regarding

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
company that I started up regarding

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.650 
company that I started up regarding
green<00:01:54.260> technology<00:01:54.890> which<00:01:55.130> would<00:01:55.400> be<00:01:55.660> helpful

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
green technology which would be helpful

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.650 
green technology which would be helpful
for<00:01:56.900> humankind<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.860> our<00:01:58.130> planet<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.480> like

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
for humankind and our planet so I like

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.490 
for humankind and our planet so I like
to<00:02:00.490> say<00:02:01.490> our<00:02:01.760> planet<00:02:02.180> but<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.660> be<00:02:02.900> have<00:02:03.470> a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
to say our planet but to be have a

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.570 
to say our planet but to be have a
little<00:02:03.860> little<00:02:04.130> part<00:02:04.580> saving<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.480> planet
