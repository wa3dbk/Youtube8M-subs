00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
this little launcher right here which is

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.450 
this little launcher right here which is
called<00:00:25.869> AT&amp;T<00:00:26.230> launcher<00:00:27.009> can<00:00:27.130> you<00:00:27.250> believe

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
called AT&amp;T launcher can you believe

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.630 
called AT&amp;T launcher can you believe
that<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:28.179> what<00:00:29.109> this<00:00:29.259> mod<00:00:29.529> does<00:00:29.800> is<00:00:30.009> it<00:00:30.460> just

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
that so what this mod does is it just

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640 
that so what this mod does is it just
allows<00:00:30.910> us<00:00:31.089> to<00:00:31.240> shoot<00:00:31.419> TNT<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.259> at<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.439> same

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
allows us to shoot TNT and at the same

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.220 
allows us to shoot TNT and at the same
time<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:33.100> also<00:00:33.130> allows<00:00:33.580> us<00:00:33.790> to<00:00:34.150> gain<00:00:34.450> resources

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
time it also allows us to gain resources

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.529 
time it also allows us to gain resources
so<00:00:35.710> as<00:00:35.950> you<00:00:36.100> can<00:00:36.220> see<00:00:36.370> there<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.700> a<00:00:36.730> bit<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:36.970> XP

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
so as you can see there is a bit of XP

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.450 
so as you can see there is a bit of XP
that<00:00:37.780> is<00:00:37.930> because<00:00:38.260> it's<00:00:38.410> Eva<00:00:38.620> blown<00:00:38.920> up<00:00:39.129> coal

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
that is because it's Eva blown up coal

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.150 
that is because it's Eva blown up coal
or<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.899> don't<00:00:41.289> know<00:00:41.379> what's<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.980> other<00:00:42.039> one

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
or I don't know what's the other one

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.630 
or I don't know what's the other one
that<00:00:42.280> gives<00:00:42.430> XP<00:00:42.969> I<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.719> that's<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.410> if<00:00:45.250> i<00:00:45.460> do

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
that gives XP I and that's it so if i do

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.610 
that gives XP I and that's it so if i do
blow<00:00:45.910> happen<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.390> blow<00:00:46.570> up<00:00:46.719> coal<00:00:47.050> or<00:00:47.199> iron<00:00:47.230> is<00:00:47.590> a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
blow happen to blow up coal or iron is a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.639 
blow happen to blow up coal or iron is a
bit<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:47.860> cut<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.280> down<00:00:48.699> there<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.289> if<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:50.469> blow

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
bit of cut and down there so if I blow

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.349 
bit of cut and down there so if I blow
it<00:00:50.770> up<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.129> then<00:00:51.219> I<00:00:51.309> head<00:00:51.460> down<00:00:51.520> almost<00:00:52.059> lover

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
it up and then I head down almost lover

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.830 
it up and then I head down almost lover
I<00:00:52.690> had<00:00:53.350> scary<00:00:53.770> music<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.460> I've<00:00:55.300> forgotten

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
I had scary music and I've forgotten

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.139 
I had scary music and I've forgotten
down<00:00:56.050> here<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.289> might<00:00:56.590> actually<00:00:56.769> pick<00:00:57.309> up<00:00:57.460> those

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
down here I might actually pick up those

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.930 
down here I might actually pick up those
iron<00:00:58.719> blocks<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.199> I<00:00:59.260> felt<00:00:59.620> this<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.399> a<00:01:00.430> great

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
iron blocks that I felt this is a great

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.049 
iron blocks that I felt this is a great
way<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.420> getting<00:01:01.989> some<00:01:02.320> resources<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:03.399> it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
way of getting some resources and it

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.910 
way of getting some resources and it
really<00:01:04.390> really<00:01:04.750> does<00:01:04.989> help<00:01:05.260> actually<00:01:05.770> it's

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
really really does help actually it's

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.710 
really really does help actually it's
very<00:01:06.160> fast<00:01:06.460> ways<00:01:06.760> but<00:01:07.150> a<00:01:07.180> lot<00:01:07.270> quicker<00:01:07.450> than

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
very fast ways but a lot quicker than

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.840 
very fast ways but a lot quicker than
mining<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.500> also<00:01:08.770> pretty<00:01:09.010> much<00:01:09.160> gives<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.640> an

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
mining and also pretty much gives you an

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.330 
mining and also pretty much gives you an
unlimited<00:01:10.600> supply<00:01:10.869> of<00:01:11.320> cobblestone<00:01:12.040> because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
unlimited supply of cobblestone because

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.469 
unlimited supply of cobblestone because
you<00:01:12.549> know<00:01:12.670> you're<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:12.939> going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.150> go<00:01:13.240> down

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
you know you're just going to go down

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.080 
you know you're just going to go down
and<00:01:13.509> you're<00:01:13.689> going<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.840> pick<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:14.170> all<00:01:14.350> up<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
and you're going to pick it all up so

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.929 
and you're going to pick it all up so
let's<00:01:16.270> try<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.509> one<00:01:16.689> here<00:01:16.930> bang<00:01:17.680> there<00:01:18.640> we<00:01:18.729> go

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
let's try this one here bang there we go

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.810 
let's try this one here bang there we go
oh<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.840> didn't<00:01:20.110> block<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.290> iron<00:01:21.250> okay<00:01:21.640> let's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
oh I didn't block the iron okay let's

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.999 
oh I didn't block the iron okay let's
see<00:01:21.909> if<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.090> works<00:01:22.119> now<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.380> blows<00:01:23.590> up<00:01:23.650> the

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
see if it works now so it blows up the

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.510 
see if it works now so it blows up the
iron<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:26.020> blew<00:01:26.320> up<00:01:26.530> completely<00:01:27.130> which<00:01:27.400> I

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
iron and it blew up completely which I

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.880 
iron and it blew up completely which I
guess<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.729> not<00:01:27.970> good<00:01:28.270> but<00:01:28.750> in<00:01:28.960> other<00:01:29.200> cases<00:01:29.290> you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
guess is not good but in other cases you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.609 
guess is not good but in other cases you
will<00:01:30.100> actually<00:01:30.369> get<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.450> other<00:01:32.140> guy<00:01:32.439> like

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
will actually get the other guy like

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.889 
will actually get the other guy like
this<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.979> co-op<00:01:33.280> proves<00:01:33.579> my<00:01:33.729> point<00:01:33.759> there<00:01:34.540> you

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
this and co-op proves my point there you

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.810 
this and co-op proves my point there you
can<00:01:34.930> actually<00:01:35.649> get<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.920> resources<00:01:36.250> just<00:01:36.610> want

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
can actually get the resources just want

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.899 
can actually get the resources just want
to<00:01:36.880> prove<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.409> at<00:01:38.619> times<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.189> quite

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
to prove it so at times it is quite

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.490 
to prove it so at times it is quite
risky<00:01:40.149> because<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.780> turns<00:01:41.020> out<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.320> like

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
risky because that turns out the like

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.280 
risky because that turns out the like
there<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.369> actually<00:01:42.880> end<00:01:43.270> up<00:01:43.479> blowing<00:01:43.960> up

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
there you can actually end up blowing up

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.330 
there you can actually end up blowing up
all<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:45.009> your<00:01:46.350> resources<00:01:47.350> with<00:01:47.710> such<00:01:47.920> as<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
all of your resources with such as the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.190 
all of your resources with such as the
iron<00:01:48.640> which<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.090> kind<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.540> good<00:01:49.689> but<00:01:49.899> kind<00:01:50.170> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
iron which is kind of good but kind of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.510 
iron which is kind of good but kind of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
actually tested this if i shoot a bunch

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.560 
actually tested this if i shoot a bunch
of<00:01:58.270> tnt<00:01:59.079> at<00:01:59.680> my<00:01:59.920> feet<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.399> cuz<00:02:01.270> i<00:02:01.329> know<00:02:01.450> they

actually added in it that old feature

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.330 
actually added in it that old feature
that<00:02:04.000> means<00:02:04.329> that<00:02:04.539> tnt<00:02:04.990> can<00:02:05.200> move<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:06.219> i

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
that means that tnt can move you so if i
