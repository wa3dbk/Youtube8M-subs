to the fact that we have our anti snag
guard<00:01:28.210> on<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.570> inside<00:01:28.930> just<00:01:29.140> here<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.830> stop

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
guard on the inside just here to stop

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.710 
guard on the inside just here to stop
the<00:01:30.190> zip<00:01:30.340> from<00:01:30.760> catching<00:01:30.940> on<00:01:31.150> any<00:01:31.270> material

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
the zip from catching on any material

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.870 
the zip from catching on any material
you'll<00:01:32.380> also<00:01:32.530> find<00:01:32.770> that's<00:01:33.220> backed<00:01:33.460> up<00:01:33.640> with

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
you'll also find that's backed up with

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.730 
you'll also find that's backed up with
this<00:01:34.120> luminous<00:01:34.690> piping<00:01:35.050> behind<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.440> up<00:01:35.620> as

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
this luminous piping behind this up as

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.020 
this luminous piping behind this up as
well<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.370> doesn't<00:01:36.520> catch<00:01:36.730> on

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
well just so that it doesn't catch on

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.230 
well just so that it doesn't catch on
now<00:01:37.330> if<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.320> do<00:01:38.380> open<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.800> up<00:01:38.860> you'll<00:01:39.490> see<00:01:39.730> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
now if I do open this up you'll see that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.210 
now if I do open this up you'll see that
we<00:01:40.390> have<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.570> full<00:01:40.870> length<00:01:41.050> zipper<00:01:41.320> baffle<00:01:41.890> runs

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
we have a full length zipper baffle runs

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.950 
we have a full length zipper baffle runs
all<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.430> way<00:01:42.580> around<00:01:42.910> here<00:01:43.330> that's<00:01:43.900> just

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
all the way around here that's just

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.990 
all the way around here that's just
going<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.260> stop<00:01:44.440> any<00:01:44.650> sort<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:44.920> drafts<00:01:45.640> or<00:01:45.760> cool

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
going to stop any sort of drafts or cool

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.470 
going to stop any sort of drafts or cool
spots<00:01:46.270> coming<00:01:46.420> in<00:01:46.660> through<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.290> zip<00:01:47.680> itself<00:01:48.130> I

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
spots coming in through the zip itself I

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.640 
spots coming in through the zip itself I
really<00:01:49.480> nice<00:01:49.630> feature<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:50.170> bag<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.560> the
