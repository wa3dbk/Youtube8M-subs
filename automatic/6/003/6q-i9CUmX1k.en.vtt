00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello my name is andrew i was working 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.769
 in company 1 we are remote 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.000
 trucks in the city of Vladivostok without 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.460
 Weekend today will tell you to 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.830
 debate on 10 tons and and hino trucks or 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.050
 Isuzu because they usually have disks 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.480
 same means when choosing 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.720
 it is important for you to know the outer diameter of the disk 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.730
 it is important to know the number of slots 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.789
 here inside and it is important to know the diameters by 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.809
 ridges and slots slots 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.290
 also when installing it is important if you are 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.510
 first time 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.330
 for example, you still don't know us 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.610
 here is the hub discs here you are entering 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.309
 regarding the disk here it is 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.870
 exactly flush so say so here 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.059
 here is this side which we flush 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.460
 set to the flywheel here this 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.110
 side which is convex nave her you 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.030
 and set to the side of the basket and so 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.539
 You are in the shop sellers you can 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.190
 offer two scenarios 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.890
 classic disc and cermet 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.170
 let's understand what is the difference between them 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.660
 the classic disk is its plus is that 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.300
 in that situation when you are sleeping 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.940
 clutch likely maha river basket 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.180
 you will stop the whole farther when you 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.920
 already burned it and the disc itself remained a whole 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.200
 that is, normal springs and no 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.490
 overheating and taffy radon go 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.920
 pretty easy in every store 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.509
 you can even pick up from korean from 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 Chinese from Russian is difficult to 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.490
 diameter matched 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.830
 Also, these discs are different in that they have 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.740
 softer inclusion 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.540
 such disks cost from 4 to 15 thousand in 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.960
 depending on the manufacturer and quality 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.400
 performance of cermet 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.110
 it means itself these inserts 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.950
 cermet are stronger than 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.869
 fiberglass 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.650
 so the drive will go longer and 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.600
 will be able 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.680
 take on more cargo then 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.800
 there are Japanese themselves 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.080
 put only on the tractor and such wheels 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.310
 further he has the disc itself is made of 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.010
 cast metal 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.440
 this is in contrast to the classic disk 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.390
 Here it is made such that the plates 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.430
 there is why and only why is it good 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 very often with classic discs 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.930
 hub separately tears away from 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.090
 from ferra.ru petals here it is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.520
 excluded 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.110
 There is a myth that pottery has more 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.840
 hard inclusion but we asked 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.030
 our customers but the driver claim 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.540
 that the inclusion of soft is good that is their 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.430
 suits such disks cost from 8 to 25 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.960
 thousand rubles, too, depending on 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.150
 producing countries and here is the quality 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.010
 execution 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.470
 These are the pros and cons of taking 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.360
 decisions you yourself will be at the end of our 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.640
