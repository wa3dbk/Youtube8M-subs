00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
hero and that's pretty significant

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.319 
hero and that's pretty significant
actually<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.339> mean<00:00:59.460> he's<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.089> best

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
actually I mean he's not one of the best

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.579 
actually I mean he's not one of the best
heroes<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.749> now<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> never<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.499> they

could<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.890> buff<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> does<00:01:02.879> save<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.179> some

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
could get buff but it does save you some
gold<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.839> perhaps<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.379> dollars<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.920> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
then you would head on over to Diablo

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.860 
then you would head on over to Diablo
and<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.890> once<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.430> game<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.570> would<00:02:36.690> actually

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and then once in game you would actually

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.470

see<00:02:37.410> an<00:02:37.920> achievement<00:02:38.280> pop<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.330> would<00:02:39.450> be

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
see an achievement pop up it would be

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.570

there<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.960> bottom<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.530> think<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.370> says

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
there on the bottom I think it says

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.450 
there on the bottom I think it says
something<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.000> heroes<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> Nexus<00:02:43.260> or<00:02:43.500> it
