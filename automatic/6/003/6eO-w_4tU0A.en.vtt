00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 very good to all of us who are in 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.680
 minecraft 1.7 points 2 with this charge of 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:15.740
 load sorry but here the town 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.640
 it's big not big but there's no 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.530
 blacksmith which is a little bittersmith 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.410
 but good god put the seeds by 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.020
 if anything and the curtains although they appear 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 over there and we're going to see a mod a sea that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.809
 is curious more than anything has time 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.490
 in this way it has enough time not 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.080
 there is no special action object 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.180
 he explained pulling because like in this 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.310
 just below 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.650
 a special diet but add a 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.650
 so cool a witch function 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.550
 in case there was some Spanish I will teach 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.930
 oslo but not the beast that we connect 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.360
 we can follow the arrows that we throw 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.309
 and that can be very cool god 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.380
 for pvp would be super super bÃ©tico 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.090
 let's see for example 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.000
 An objective 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.240
 I do not like where the bugs are here 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.429
 to the pig here like for example the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.909
 that we can throw normal arrows like 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.590
 always but if we keep the shift and 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.080
 we throw the arrow with the shift maintained 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.120
 one year 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 and we follow up arrow 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.840
 what is a mine but much more time what 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.990
 you're cross-eyed you know it blind angel 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.650
 well we have not killed you that we 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.650
 we continue until it falls 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.650
 so that if it falls very far like that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.650
 disappears the arrow is a bit weird 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 we can I'm trying to see if it looks 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.330
 value because the bird is throwing 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.460
 but only follows the first and does not pass 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.460
 nothing 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 add much more is this simply 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.820
 Spanish is not a sniper 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.260
 joe 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.110
 is very creative I'm really cool about this 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.470
 follow the arrow as you see is a mine 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.870
 but in fashion a lot of the part that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.210
 also I do not play provides then no 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.320
 I know how it goes to the shaft because I do not like what 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.320
 I tried once and we like to play 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.010
 I say that this can also serve 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.470
 for example , let's imagine that this is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.170
 our base and over there I do not know how it goes 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.680
 that's why I say with this we can gossip 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.680
 to the enemy 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.340
 the arrow costs us but we see 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.730
 around this would also be a little bit 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.319
 trap not logical because we could 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.269
 gossip what others have 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.560
 but cool dude, I'm really cool 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.550
 tracking that makes the arrow 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.550
 this super ethical 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.050
 I wanted to give you and failed is very peak 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.050
 has behind the mountains 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.680
 there is nothing especially we 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.810
 more mountain but it's cool 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.940
 simply keeping the shift is 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.720
 very very cool but good this is everything 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.820
 what we bring is curious 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.620
 mamola many days fried officiated this 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.950
 to follow the arrow but a tennis player and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.670
 the description is for 1.7 point 2 it 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.670
 install with forge as always a lot 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 all right 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.270
 stop killing one before finishing the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.900
 video 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.900
 all right
