sketch<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.700> our<00:01:45.090> shape<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
sketch out our shape I want to do a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.649 
sketch out our shape I want to do a
triangle<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.640> could<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> half<00:01:48.270> circle

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
triangle but you could do a half circle

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.679 
triangle but you could do a half circle
you<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.759> rectangle<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.360> could<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you could do a rectangle you could do a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
you could do a rectangle you could do a
square<00:01:52.229> however<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> triangle<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.149> fit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
square however a triangle really fit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
square however a triangle really fit
well<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> shape<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.560> book<00:01:55.860> then

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
well with the shape of this book then

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
well with the shape of this book then
you're<00:01:56.549> gonna<00:01:56.640> take<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.060> exacto<00:01:57.420> knife<00:01:57.780> if

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you're gonna take your exacto knife if

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
you're gonna take your exacto knife if
you<00:01:58.079> didn't<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.439> an<00:01:58.560> exacto<00:01:58.950> knife<00:01:59.100> you

you didn't have an exacto knife you
could<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> same<00:01:59.759> thing<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.149> scissors

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
could do the same thing with scissors

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.260 
could do the same thing with scissors
you<00:02:00.689> would<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.259> pick<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:02.670> much<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.119> your

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you would just pick up as much as your

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.300 
you would just pick up as much as your
scissors<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:03.899> through<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.979> work

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
scissors can go through and then work

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
scissors can go through and then work
through<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.240> scissors<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.719> way

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
through with your scissors that way

however what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.789> push<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.509> hard<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.020> but

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

going to push down as hard as I can but
the<00:02:10.800> exacto<00:02:11.190> knife<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.030> get

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the exacto knife and see if we can get

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.250 
the exacto knife and see if we can get
several<00:02:12.450> layers<00:02:12.720> out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
several layers out

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.020 
several layers out
time<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.069> just<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> outline<00:02:14.549> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
time and I'm just going to outline the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.089 
time and I'm just going to outline the
little<00:02:15.269> rough<00:02:15.480> sketch<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.500> triangle<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.069> I

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
little rough sketch of a triangle that I

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.979 
little rough sketch of a triangle that I
drew<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.030> only<00:02:18.209> need<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.599> if<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
drew that and you only need to go if you

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.030 
drew that and you only need to go if you
go<00:02:19.110> all<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.290> way<00:02:19.379> down<00:02:19.590> from<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.799> top<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
go all the way down from the top and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.679 
go all the way down from the top and
then<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.519> meeting<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.000> points<00:02:21.329> you'll<00:02:21.480> have

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
then just meeting the points you'll have

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.289 
then just meeting the points you'll have
your<00:02:21.840> triangle<00:02:22.430> perfectly<00:02:23.430> shaped<00:02:23.670> there<00:02:24.000> so

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
your triangle perfectly shaped there so

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.550 
your triangle perfectly shaped there so
let's<00:02:24.510> try<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.870> out<00:02:26.629> pressing<00:02:27.629> hard<00:02:27.840> be<00:02:28.379> sure

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
let's try this out pressing hard be sure

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.030 
let's try this out pressing hard be sure
to<00:02:28.680> keep<00:02:28.799> your<00:02:28.950> fingers<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.879> way<00:02:29.989> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
to keep your fingers out of the way and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
to keep your fingers out of the way and
you<00:02:32.040> may<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.670> hold<00:02:32.879> like<00:02:33.060> mine<00:02:33.329> my<00:02:33.629> spine

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you may have to hold like mine my spine

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.600 
you may have to hold like mine my spine
is<00:02:34.319> coming<00:02:34.680> through<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.099> may<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.459> to

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
is coming through so you may have to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.729 
is coming through so you may have to
hold<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.000> top<00:02:36.209> here<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.200> you're<00:02:37.319> gonna<00:02:37.409> press

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
hold the top here but you're gonna press

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.949 
hold the top here but you're gonna press
down<00:02:38.010> hard<00:02:40.879> trying<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:41.970> penetrate<00:02:42.239> as<00:02:42.689> many

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
down hard trying to penetrate as many

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.339 
down hard trying to penetrate as many
layers<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.349> possible<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.870> then<00:02:46.049> you're<00:02:46.200> going

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
layers as possible and then you're going

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:57.280 
layers as possible and then you're going
to<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.739> other<00:02:46.890> side<00:02:47.250> start<00:02:47.730> at<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> top

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.710 

okay<00:02:58.290> let's<00:02:58.680> see<00:02:59.069> if<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.430> works<00:02:59.700> oh<00:03:00.030> look<00:03:00.600> at

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
okay let's see if that works oh look at

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.650 
okay let's see if that works oh look at

we have our first few pieces how cute is

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.790 
we have our first few pieces how cute is
that<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:20.070> we<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.880> few<00:03:21.360> more<00:03:21.600> layers<00:03:22.260> here

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
that and we have a few more layers here

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.740 
that and we have a few more layers here
that<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.610> penetrated<00:03:24.360> through<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.480> can

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that we penetrated through so you can

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.990 
that we penetrated through so you can
just<00:03:28.020> pull<00:03:28.320> those<00:03:28.530> up<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.010> see<00:03:29.340> how<00:03:29.550> deep<00:03:29.850> it

just pull those up and see how deep it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.240 
just pull those up and see how deep it
actually<00:03:30.480> goes<00:03:33.560> when<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.650> get<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> point

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
actually goes when you get to the point

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.699 
actually goes when you get to the point
where<00:03:35.489> things<00:03:35.790> aren't<00:03:36.269> coming<00:03:37.230> out<00:03:37.380> as

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
where things aren't coming out as

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.620 
where things aren't coming out as
smoothly<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.690> rip<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.170> off<00:03:40.410> here<00:03:40.830> and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
smoothly you can rip this off here and

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
there's several ways to do this the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.800 
there's several ways to do this the
first<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.490> which<00:05:00.640> is<00:05:00.700> you<00:05:01.030> can<00:05:01.210> fold<00:05:01.600> over<00:05:02.020> and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
first of which is you can fold over and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.490 
first of which is you can fold over and
just<00:05:04.810> attach<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:05.410> by<00:05:05.920> glue<00:05:06.340> or<00:05:06.730> tape<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.570> have

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
just attach it by glue or tape and have

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.650 
just attach it by glue or tape and have
it<00:05:08.710> covered<00:05:08.890> up<00:05:09.100> like<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.000> then<00:05:10.420> you<00:05:10.540> would

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
it covered up like so and then you would

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.270 
it covered up like so and then you would
just<00:05:10.840> trim<00:05:11.290> these<00:05:11.800> excess<00:05:12.400> tails<00:05:12.790> off<00:05:13.120> or<00:05:14.280> what

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
start threading these through and what I

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.680 
start threading these through and what I
like<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.680> do<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:48.100> thread<00:05:48.490> them<00:05:48.670> from<00:05:49.240> one<00:05:49.450> end

to<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.140> middle<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.710> then<00:05:51.130> once<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.610> gets

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
to the middle and then once that gets

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.330 
to the middle and then once that gets
full<00:05:52.150> thread<00:05:52.480> from<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:52.840> other<00:05:53.050> end<00:05:53.350> back<00:05:53.710> you

could<00:05:54.580> thread<00:05:54.910> from<00:05:55.180> one<00:05:55.270> end<00:05:55.570> all<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.870> way<00:05:55.900> to

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
could thread from one end all the way to

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.840 
could thread from one end all the way to
the<00:05:56.170> other<00:05:56.290> however<00:05:56.680> that's<00:05:56.980> a<00:05:57.100> long<00:05:57.340> distance

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.640 
the other however that's a long distance
to<00:05:58.240> thread<00:05:58.480> them<00:05:58.600> now<00:05:58.960> as<00:05:59.230> you're<00:05:59.440> threading

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
to thread them now as you're threading

these be sure you're going the same way
either<00:06:01.720> up<00:06:01.990> from<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.320> bottom<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.800> then<00:06:03.370> down

either up from the bottom and then down

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.050 
either up from the bottom and then down
across<00:06:04.030> to<00:06:04.480> get<00:06:04.660> your<00:06:04.840> line<00:06:05.080> in<00:06:05.290> front<00:06:06.030> like<00:06:07.030> so

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
across to get your line in front like so

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.530 
across to get your line in front like so
or<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.770> have<00:06:08.980> it<00:06:09.130> like<00:06:09.370> this<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:10.090> would<00:06:10.300> be<00:06:10.330> the

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
or to have it like this it would be the

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.780 
or to have it like this it would be the
reverse<00:06:10.930> but<00:06:11.470> to<00:06:11.590> make<00:06:11.740> them<00:06:11.890> all<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.160> same<00:06:12.520> or

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
reverse but to make them all the same or

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.050 
reverse but to make them all the same or
rotating<00:06:13.540> I<00:06:13.660> think<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.290> will<00:06:14.470> do<00:06:14.710> these<00:06:14.980> all<00:06:15.640> the

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
rotating I think I will do these all the

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.880 
rotating I think I will do these all the
same<00:06:16.090> now<00:06:16.720> you<00:06:16.780> can<00:06:16.990> decide<00:06:17.140> how<00:06:17.350> much<00:06:17.530> space

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
same now you can decide how much space

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.560 
same now you can decide how much space
you<00:06:18.130> want<00:06:18.220> in<00:06:18.400> between<00:06:18.520> yours<00:06:19.030> but<00:06:19.300> they<00:06:19.390> are<00:06:19.540> a
