why we're planning to do it and that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660 
why we're planning to do it and that
whole<00:01:06.479> sort<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> thinking<00:01:07.110> process<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> just

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
whole sort of thinking process and just

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
whole sort of thinking process and just
in<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.880> different<00:01:09.000> format<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
in a different format and that's that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.719 
in a different format and that's that
still<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.860> worked<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.220> still<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> be

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
still to be worked out still to be

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
still to be worked out still to be
finalized<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:13.500> something<00:01:13.710> we're

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
finalized but it's something we're

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.850 
finalized but it's something we're
desperately<00:01:14.610> keen<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.530> reason

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
desperately keen to do and the reason

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
desperately keen to do and the reason
for<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.310> exactly<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
for that is exactly the same as the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
for that is exactly the same as the
reason<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.780> started<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.290> I'm<00:01:19.920> probably<00:01:20.220> more

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
reason we started with I'm probably more

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
reason we started with I'm probably more
so<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> year<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.110> heard<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.470> the

has been in the past we're coming under

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
has been in the past we're coming under
more<00:01:39.810> pressure<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.400> we<00:01:41.400> seem<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.729> coming

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
more pressure and we seem to be coming

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.399 
more pressure and we seem to be coming
under<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.299> pressure<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> weather<00:01:43.079> as

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
under more pressure from the weather as

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.880 
under more pressure from the weather as

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
farming is and I think there's a big

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.589 
farming is and I think there's a big
lesson<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.609> there<00:02:59.730> for<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.000> industry<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
lesson in there for the industry and

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.509 
lesson in there for the industry and
that<00:03:01.019> one<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> reasons<00:03:01.859> why<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.190> need<00:03:02.370> to

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
that one of the reasons why we need to

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.080 
that one of the reasons why we need to
keep<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.760> sort<00:03:03.389> of<00:03:03.480> communication<00:03:04.049> going
