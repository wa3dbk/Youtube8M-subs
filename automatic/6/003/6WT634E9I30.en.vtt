00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
now that yellow building over there is

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.759 
now that yellow building over there is
the<00:03:25.920> back<00:03:26.370> end<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.849> terminal<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.769> is

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the back end of the terminal this is

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.800 
the back end of the terminal this is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180 

and<00:03:38.819> then<00:03:39.270> as<00:03:39.599> we<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.959> off<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.470> direction

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
and then as we go off that direction

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.520 
and then as we go off that direction
that's<00:03:41.730> eastward<00:03:42.330> toward<00:03:44.090> Reno<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:46.110> over<00:03:46.410> the
