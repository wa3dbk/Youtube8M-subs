00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
seam and it turns out crooked or

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
with other once there's a hole in it
there<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.710> hole<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.220> permanently<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
there that hole is there permanently so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.600 
there that hole is there permanently so
you<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:09.990> precise<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.130> like

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you have to be very precise and like

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
you have to be very precise and like
very<00:01:12.240> planned<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:12.960> where<00:01:13.380> exactly

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very planned out about where exactly

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.350 
very planned out about where exactly
you're<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.220> putting<00:01:14.400> stitching<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you're going to be putting stitching and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800 
you're going to be putting stitching and
all<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.170> those<00:01:16.580> aspects<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.600> can't

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
all of those aspects because you can't

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
all of those aspects because you can't
really<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.110> never<00:01:20.040> start<00:01:20.280> over<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
really go back never start over if you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.660 
really go back never start over if you
mess<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.000> her<00:01:21.720> aesthetic<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.860> very<00:01:22.890> minimal

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
mess up her aesthetic is very minimal

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.719 
mess up her aesthetic is very minimal
it's<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.950> most<00:01:26.070> people<00:01:26.369> who<00:01:26.430> described

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's it's what most people who described

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.370 
it's it's what most people who described
as<00:01:26.850> classic<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> no-nonsense

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
as classic it's kind of a no-nonsense

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.100 
as classic it's kind of a no-nonsense
these<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.369> nice<00:01:29.850> materials<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.689> they're<00:01:30.960> put

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
these are nice materials and they're put

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
these are nice materials and they're put
together<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.520> very<00:01:33.210> much

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
together well and so it's very much

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
together well and so it's very much
about<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.590> appreciation<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.159> craftsmanship

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
about the appreciation of craftsmanship

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
about the appreciation of craftsmanship
whenever<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> come<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.320> kind<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
whenever I come up with a kind of a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120 
whenever I come up with a kind of a
random<00:01:38.460> idea<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.390> something<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.590> out

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
random idea of something for to make out

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.120 
random idea of something for to make out
of<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> denim<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.790> leather<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.360> all<00:01:43.049> text<00:01:43.979> her

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and say hey you should make this and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
and say hey you should make this and
then<00:01:47.640> three<00:01:48.060> hours<00:01:48.090> later<00:01:48.299> she'll<00:01:48.750> she'll

then three hours later she'll she'll
have<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.610> working<00:01:50.610> prototype<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.119> mean<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.479> guess

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
have a working prototype I mean I guess

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
have a working prototype I mean I guess
I<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:51.899> say<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:53.159> there's
