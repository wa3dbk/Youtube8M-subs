00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.420
 There, my people, we have one more 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.120
 video of this time here minecraft war 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.130
 for the quick dops here that as already 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 I commented in the last video will be videos 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 of that average about five 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.279
 roof minutes with fast services 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 So we can do some things. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.050
 here is interesting with some people 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 have doubts so they can leave you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 a little confused right? 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.910
 So that's it, I hope you like it. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 This idea is what we're going to do. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.099
 today as you saw in the title is 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.969
 find out what's in the clouds face 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.010
 exactly the clouds are not levels 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.140
 normal is that for example it is a cloud 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.120
 normal but there was that one had that type 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.579
 of soap opera is a bit different 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 we will see the secret of these clouds 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.450
 is the following on the internet many blocks 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.149
 So we can get there. 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.920
 I think it's enough then oh my 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.239
 God, here we go, let's see what 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 it may happen 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.739
 I think from here we come 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.440
 there but it's a bit of work to then 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 do with this mess but let's go 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 In this episode we will see what 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 The secret of this cloud is on 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.530
 A lot of people were wondering, is it possible? 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.780
 breaking the cloud and graphing is to do 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 Something about her I do not know about. 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.979
 true or not if we will find out 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 Right now, the guys here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.729
 continue to make these types of videos 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.170
 so in short but with content I 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.850
 I need your support. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.189
 so do not forget to leave your home and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.830
 that if you enjoy this type of video 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.630
 because it is very much help that the channel 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.450
 Do you understand me then? 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.790
 we are coming up here is come 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.000
 It 's almost here we'll try. 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.979
 find out the secret of these clouds 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 What do you think, these little dudes? 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.540
 Hides here, looks exactly here. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.659
 Damn these girls, we're going to go there. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.310
 Up here here it seems they 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.409
 they are like a block, right? 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.840
 because it is we will discover the color what these 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.659
 clouds can do here we are already here 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 Let's try breaking a block of them. 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.560
 Exactly guys, we got a good face. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.170
 like the cloud 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.180
 Look what a weird thing to see. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.469
 cloud here we can do what the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.879
 Can people do this? 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:11.459
 clÃ¡udia bloch korn angola block nook 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.990
 It does not seem to glue things like 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.120
 say is to structure this legacy 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.140
 Do you build something like that? 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 but the folks that old it founds 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.640
 looks just that the museum does not seem to fall 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.380
 She arrests me, Mother's daughter, no 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.000
 I asked to be putz and I died now in the islands. 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 Paul, now I'm going to fuck myself to go back to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.430
 there but live staff we got here 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.200
 discover the secret of this cloud there 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.900
 now we can try to make some 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.550
 different things there with her 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.530
 I need something that we can 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.630
 do in our house we discovered 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 that it is kraft, nor can we 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.740
 build things from it that is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.840
 very cool, can we try 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.910
 do some things in our house then 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.890
 that's what I wanted to make a short video 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.270
 Even for you, it 's killing curiosity. 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.400
 Do not even mention some curiosities. 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.560
 watching the minecraft war on the mote 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.900
 pec that can be very useful 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.390
 instead of making a video of one of the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.310
 same series in an episode that will not 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.380
 have nothing to do for example will have d'avila 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.780
 kill bose that start to rise because the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.940
 cloud understood so I hope even 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.860
 You have tanned me there. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.580
 god that boar boiled creased valley no 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 Valley 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.480
 there but I'm going crazy then 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.280
 people are staying here 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.410
 people do not forget to evaluate this 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.210
 video so I can have a sense of what 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.460
 I can do it if I can continue 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.320
 eight agents it stops or will depend 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.970
