eight<00:03:16.769> points<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.329> really<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.810> what<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
eight points this is really the what I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.690 
eight points this is really the what I
think<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.980> key<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.370> game<00:03:20.519> because

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
think is the key to the game because

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.030 
think is the key to the game because
this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.959> only<00:03:22.019> defense<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.650> scales

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this is the only defense that scales

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.310 
this is the only defense that scales
with<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:24.060> know<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.239> can<00:03:24.480> keep<00:03:24.690> finding<00:03:24.989> more

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.120 
of people want to build the ramparts
because<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.930> unlocks<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.350> lot<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.680> high

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
because it unlocks a lot of high

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.250

defensive<00:03:41.670> buildings<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.959> might<00:03:43.139> need

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
defensive buildings that we might need

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.910 
defensive buildings that we might need
in<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> case<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.889> spike<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:45.060> i<00:03:45.920> still

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
in the case of the spike but i still

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.620 
in the case of the spike but i still
think<00:03:46.980> defensive<00:03:47.579> focus<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.090> better<00:03:48.359> pic

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
think defensive focus is the better pic

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.410 
think defensive focus is the better pic
