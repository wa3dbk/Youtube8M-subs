bottom a little bit and we can slide
further<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:09.060> into<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> filter<00:02:11.090> or<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.450> could

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
further back into the filter or we could

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
further back into the filter or we could
come<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:13.170> well<00:02:13.379> if<00:02:13.650> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
come out as well if we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.170 
come out as well if we
looking<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> little<00:02:14.490> bit<00:02:14.640> maybe<00:02:14.850> more<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
looking for a little bit maybe more of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.600 
looking for a little bit maybe more of
an<00:02:15.330> open<00:02:15.630> sound<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.740> variation<00:02:17.430> in

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
an open sound so the variation in

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.090 
an open sound so the variation in
filtering<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.330> how<00:02:18.930> deep<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.470> decide<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.950> go

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
filtering is how deep you decide to go

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.940 
filtering is how deep you decide to go
into<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.610> filter<00:02:20.880> itself<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> mic

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.230 
into the filter itself with the mic
personally<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.010> find<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.460> starting<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
personally I find that starting and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.390 
personally I find that starting and
probably<00:02:24.810> remaining<00:02:25.320> around<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.980> edge<00:02:26.130> of

probably remaining around the edge of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.340 
probably remaining around the edge of
the<00:02:26.490> filter<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.240> good<00:02:27.480> spot<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:27.750> me<00:02:28.110> when

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the filter is a good spot for me when

the filter is a good spot for me when

twofold<00:02:50.400> first<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.390> all<00:02:51.480> when<00:02:51.660> you're<00:02:51.780> singing

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
twofold first of all when you're singing

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.470 
twofold first of all when you're singing
you're<00:02:52.200> speaking<00:02:52.620> into<00:02:52.830> these<00:02:53.459> panels<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
you're speaking into these panels it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.150 
you're speaking into these panels it
helps<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> reduce<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.470> amount<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
helps to reduce the amount of the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.830 
helps to reduce the amount of the
original<00:02:56.250> source<00:02:56.820> making<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.450> into<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
original source making it out into the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
original source making it out into the
room<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.709> course<00:02:58.950> we've<00:02:59.130> got<00:02:59.160> diffusion

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
room and of course we've got diffusion

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.180 
room and of course we've got diffusion
and<00:03:00.120> absorption<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.050> way<00:03:01.170> back<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.770> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
and absorption on the way back so it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.949 
and absorption on the way back so it
further<00:03:02.400> eliminates<00:03:02.970> reflections<00:03:03.540> coming<00:03:03.720> to

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
further eliminates reflections coming to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
further eliminates reflections coming to
the<00:03:04.080> rear<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> sides<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.340> the

microphone the reflection filter really

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.280 
microphone the reflection filter really
does<00:03:08.340> what<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.820> looks<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.270> it'll<00:03:09.450> do<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.930> own

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
does what it looks like it'll do I own

does what it looks like it'll do I own
one<00:03:10.560> personally<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.280> helps<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.670> tighten<00:03:11.970> a
