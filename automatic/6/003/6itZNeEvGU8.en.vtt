00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.680
 The Mercedes Sprinter is one of the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.990
 best selling delivery van in germany 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.910
 it also comes along as four times four 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.040
 four-wheel drive intended for difficult 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.560
 Wintry conditions like here in the 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.050
 austrian hochgurgl born to run 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.599
 Born to run Mercedes promises 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.140
 benz we want to test if that too in the 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.140
 snow applies 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.790
 we have the big advantage when 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.739
 sprinter that was a switchable 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.180
 Four-wheel drive means that means I can 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.070
 the vehicle is regular in the company two 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.030
 move and the four-wheel drive 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.489
 to turn on when the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.739
 Road conditions require in the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.910
 alps no rarity 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.650
 easily accelerates the four-wheeled place 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.660
 If two of the four wheels go on 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.660
 slippery underground must find stop 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.079
 In general, the sprinter 4 x 4 2 can 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.760
 offroader 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.770
 nevertheless his body is in 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.570
 compared to the normal sprinter women 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.440
 at 11 and at the back by eight centimeters 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.210
 raised 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.430
 the terrain makes the elevated 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.350
 ground clearance noticeable the 4 x 4 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.710
 copes with bumps and dome 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.190
 gradients easier than normal 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.190
 rear-wheel drive version 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.400
 we met was instructor violet 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.750
 By the head she shows us that the four-wheel 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.590
 even in extreme winter conditions 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.850
 right now just come out of the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.850
 I stood there full throttle 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.250
 ice snow but still great propulsion 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.930
 with the 4 x 4 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.049
 here is a bit of gas 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.479
 to go because I follow the car 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.390
 optimally which a steering angle 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.000
 Understeer is super here many 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.470
 always think big heavy vehicle 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.300
 difficult to handle but you can see it here 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.130
 do not have very difficult conditions 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.840
 only from the point of view today but also 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.120
 closed under the snow dealer 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.800
 ice blanket so very smooth difficult 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.610
 conditions but the car is distracting 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.850
 super steering behavior no understeer 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.920
 finished fine here already at low 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.269
 revs reached allrad sprint 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.269
 his maxi minister at the moment 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.900
 as a four-cylinder, it comes in two 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.970
 lighting levels 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.019
 we test the stronger version with 120 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 kw performance 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.000
 your maximum torque of 360 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.660
 Newton meters is already at 1400 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.660
 turns on 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.230
 there is also a safe as a driver 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.880
 emotion is a curve ahead of us 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.970
 the rules of physics apply 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.580
 important is always early enough on the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.590
 slow down into the curve and here 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.750
 we can also get out accordingly 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.380
 accelerate number sees me 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.370
 good speed and fast 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.320
 That's the advantage of the four-wheel drive 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.240
 a real plus so when it comes to 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.160
 safety is worth it 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.460
 Purchase one as sprint it for 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.460
 each 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.320
 mercedes has the alps with good reason 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.220
 selected for the presentation of the new 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.840
 we have ours there primarily 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.420
 focus on commercial customers such as 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.720
 for example hotels in the alpine region 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.640
 as here your customers also by the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.950
 snowy landscape over the streets 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.040
 for example, too 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.140
 Forester or customer on construction sites 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.980
 on the way 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.510
 Construction sites like the streets and 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.270
 like we are talking about a 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.470
 traction wheel to get in there easily 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.950
 such situations more traction 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.020
 Being able to offer swing crew is total 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.330
 Bus driver and thus exactly the target group 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.370
 The mercedes in view, we have him loading 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.820
 a four-wheel sprinter for us too 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.820
 test 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.680
 The assistant has five assistant systems 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.810
 new four by four sprinters on board 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.360
 These include distance and blind spot 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.340
 warner high beam and lane keeping assistant 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.650
 newly added is the side wind 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.169
 Assistant holding the car in the lane 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.169
 when it blows from the side 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.740
 So for up here in the mountains makes 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.979
 a lot of sense 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.110
 you are safer you do not have chains 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.719
 raise more with small snowfalls 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.399
 You can only go around the bend 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.129
 drive without you have to be afraid 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:02.740
 that one stops just like it 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.649
 so here in the mountains is so 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.960
 Interior is commercially robust as it is 

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:12.759
 but also has to be for everyday business 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.499
 something for the eye is what especially the 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.649
 Center console acts for a utility vehicle 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:19.649
 chic and not just functional 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:28.810
 The seating position of the sprinter is 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.129
 Perfect buttons are clearly arranged by yourself 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.069
 This four-wheel switch you can 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.599
 Serve quickly and you go once 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.490
 once it has dealt with it 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.229
 that feels the same way 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.680
 same as with the other donor 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.680
 with the normal ones 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.630
 in our view it is I say a 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.550
 very specific application it is for 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.800
 the customers who need more traction 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.720
 it is rather a niche we speak in 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.270
 year of a few thousand dear 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.770
 but it is not, I say 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.440
 in predominant allrad parts in 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.320
 to expect our segment more accurately 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.760
 said it was only 2000 in the last year 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.979
 four times four sprinters worldwide 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.290
 they are happy for those who need him 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:13.960
 the more the four-wheel version costs in 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.960
 germany around 8400 euro in addition
