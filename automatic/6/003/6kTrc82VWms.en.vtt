00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 we wanted today's day Wednesday 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.029
 we will wake up with years covered skies 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.529
 the space baleares has been raining 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.599
 early morning and will continue to do so during 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.219
 the day showers that may be 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.330
 locally strong and persistent in the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.460
 south of north valencia of alicante 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 interior of the region of Murcia in 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 Melilla and Ceuta do not rule out that the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.400
 processes the precipitations are in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.170
 snow shape from 1200 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 meters in the southeastern mountains 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 rains and mornings passed by water 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.380
 also in the eastern Cantabrian and high 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.910
 we hope that they will send those 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 residual rains to make way for 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
 sun in the second half of the day except in 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.780
 the Iberian Teruel and are the centers 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 the rest of the environment much more stable 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 One more day, the wind was getting stronger 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 on the narrow eastern coast and the Canary Islands 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
 where the delicious regime will accumulate 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.610
 cloudiness leaving rainfall to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140
 north of the islands of greater relief all 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 as for the state of the sky but the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 tomorrow today will be cooler especially the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.930
 half north of minimum temperatures 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.420
 will lower the thermometers will be placed in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.770
 many provinces below zero how can you 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.809
 in the case of Castilla y León and the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.370
 interior of galicia there will be where 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.260
 we register weak frosts in zones 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 Lugo and high ourense and like 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.460
 west of Castile and Leon will 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.460
 moderate in pyrenees and Iberian system 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.030
 good morning we have a day ahead 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 marked by wind and heavy rains 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 in the southeast the last hours the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 small storm located on the north 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 of Africa has left cloudiness and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.600
 rainfall in the third so and so 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.159
 will continue to do during the day 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.409
 showers that may be locally 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.970
 strong and persistent south of 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.039
 north valencia of alicante interior of 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.780
 The region of Murcia Melilla and Ceuta 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.670
 we discard that the precipitations are 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.159
 as snow from 1200 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.679
 meters in the southern sierra this morning 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.899
 passed by water also in the Cantabrian 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.909
 more eastern and in the upper ebro where 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.409
 we hope that they will send those 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.330
 residual rains to make way for 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.789
 sun the second half of the day 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.700
 except the turolense america and central zone 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.590
 in the rest as they see much more environment 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.789
 Stable the wind one more day was getting worse 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.220
 strongly on the eastern coast 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.200
 narrow and Canary where the regime of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.880
 It will accumulate the cloudiness of the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.459
 north of the islands of greater relief without 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.170
 discard some weak rains 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.480
 all this in terms of the state of the sky 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.489
 but the morning today is colder in the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.530
 half north minimum temperatures that 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.150
 will fall markedly by placing the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.629
 thermometers in many provinces 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.579
 and lion with temperatures below zero that 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.920
 that will cause are weak frosts in are 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.540
 both high ourense lugo West 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.970
 castilla and león 'and moderate in the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.620
 Pyrenees and the Iberian system in 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.750
 the maxims as you see will be much more 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.750
 high in the southwest of the country there 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.790
 we will talk about 19 or 18 degrees that 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.250
 they contrast with the 10 degrees we have 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.439
 on the Cantabrian coast where tomorrow 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.750
 we will have a long time and evening sun 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.090
 it is expected much smoother up to 5 degrees 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.930
 we could reach in areas of Cantabria 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.730
 and the Basque country instead if we talk about 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.709
 the variation of the night there 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.420
 we would have in different points be much 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.519
 colder as in the third 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.139
 Eastern and central sun notice because 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.420
 the ebro delta we would even reach 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.909
 subtract up to three degrees so tomorrow 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.420
 the frosts will spread north of the 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
 country 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.010
 otherwise much more stable environment 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.319
 and sunny and sunny to what we hope 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.730
 for tomorrow in the center and north 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.739
 we will continue talking about showers 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.049
 on the Mediterranean coast 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.150
 but that will be sending the wind 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.870
 blowing quite hard and the level 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.870
 going up
