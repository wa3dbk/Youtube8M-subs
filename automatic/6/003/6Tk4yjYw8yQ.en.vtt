it<00:02:33.100> helps<00:02:33.340> us<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.519> give<00:02:33.640> an<00:02:33.760> understanding<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it helps us to give an understanding of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.960 
it helps us to give an understanding of
exactly<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.890> we're<00:02:36.069> learning<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.610> why

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
exactly what we're learning and why

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.819 
exactly what we're learning and why
we're<00:02:37.239> learning<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.260> how<00:02:38.560> often

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
we're learning that and and how often

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.650 
we're learning that and and how often
should<00:02:39.250> kids<00:02:39.549> know<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.910> learning<00:02:40.239> target

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
should kids know the learning target

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.930 
should kids know the learning target
they<00:02:41.320> should<00:02:41.500> know<00:02:41.620> every<00:02:42.010> day<00:02:42.190> exactly<00:02:42.760> what

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
they should know every day exactly what

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.160 
they should know every day exactly what
they're<00:02:43.120> doing<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.510> what<00:02:43.570> they're<00:02:43.750> supposed

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
they're doing and what they're supposed

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.930 
they're doing and what they're supposed
to<00:02:44.320> be<00:02:44.410> doing<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.070> once<00:02:45.549> again<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.850> reason

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to be doing and once again the reason

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.250 
to be doing and once again the reason
why<00:02:46.299> they're<00:02:46.690> learning<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:47.110> they're

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
why they're learning what they're

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.300 
why they're learning what they're
learning

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.830 

so<00:02:53.310> some<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.910> students<00:02:54.360> worry<00:02:54.570> that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
so some of the students worry that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
so some of the students worry that
depending<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.260> what<00:02:55.410> teacher<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.220> will

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
depending on what teacher they get will

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.090 
depending on what teacher they get will

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
be what it is they learn that's not the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.010 
be what it is they learn that's not the
case<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.880> teacher<00:03:00.090> selected<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> power
