00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
alright guys Richard from the RC network

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.379 
alright guys Richard from the RC network
and<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.010> gonna<00:00:11.160> be<00:00:11.250> update<00:00:11.849> number<00:00:12.150> two

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
and this is gonna be update number two

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.180 
and this is gonna be update number two
on<00:00:12.690> my<00:00:12.750> project<00:00:13.650> SCT<00:00:14.519> II<00:00:15.230> converted<00:00:16.230> into<00:00:16.470> an

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
on my project SCT II converted into an

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.060 
on my project SCT II converted into an
eighth<00:00:17.609> skill<00:00:18.119> buggy<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.859> not<00:00:20.039> my

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
eighth skill buggy now this is not my

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.779 
eighth skill buggy now this is not my
original<00:00:20.939> idea<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.470> seen<00:00:22.800> squirrel<00:00:23.519> on

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
original idea I have seen squirrel on

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.720 
original idea I have seen squirrel on
YouTube<00:00:24.210> also<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.740> know<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.099> MIP

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
YouTube also do this and I know that MIP

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.830 
YouTube also do this and I know that MIP
is<00:00:27.000> also<00:00:27.570> working<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.340> concept<00:00:29.840> vehicle

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
is also working on this concept vehicle

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.410 
is also working on this concept vehicle
now<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> whole<00:00:31.800> idea<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.489> basically<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.120> take

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
now the whole idea is basically to take

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.920 
now the whole idea is basically to take
a<00:00:33.480> low<00:00:33.780> CS<00:00:34.110> CTE<00:00:34.850> throw<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.420> MIP

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
a low CS CTE throw on the MIP

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
a low CS CTE throw on the MIP
performance<00:00:37.680> kit<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.399> only<00:00:38.610> makes<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
performance kit which not only makes it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
performance kit which not only makes it
drive<00:00:39.930> better<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.469> also<00:00:40.920> lightens<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
drive better but also lightens it up a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.260 
drive better but also lightens it up a
bit<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.980> converting<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.090> make

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
bit and then converting it and to make

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.850 
bit and then converting it and to make
it<00:00:45.390> look<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:46.020> eighth<00:00:46.110> scale<00:00:46.350> buggy<00:00:46.590> now

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it look like an eighth scale buggy now

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
it look like an eighth scale buggy now
it's<00:00:47.039> still<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> short<00:00:47.610> course<00:00:47.820> truck<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.329> heart

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's still a short course truck at heart

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's still a short course truck at heart
and<00:00:49.700> you're<00:00:50.700> only<00:00:50.910> running<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.320> sell

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and you're only running it on to sell

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
and you're only running it on to sell
electronics<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.910> other<00:00:54.000> words<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.449> 540

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
electronics so in other words of 540

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.180 
electronics so in other words of 540
size<00:00:55.289> motor<00:00:56.780> 540<00:00:57.780> size<00:00:58.020> ESC<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:58.980> one

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
size motor 540 size ESC if you got one

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.380 
size motor 540 size ESC if you got one
and<00:00:59.430> also<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> sell<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.109> 2s<00:01:01.710> lipo<00:01:02.390> electronics

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and also to sell or 2s lipo electronics

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.710 
and also to sell or 2s lipo electronics
and<00:01:03.629> batteries<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.500> pretty<00:01:05.489> cool<00:01:05.700> concept<00:01:06.210> we

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and batteries so pretty cool concept we

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
and batteries so pretty cool concept we
will<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.049> doing<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> full<00:01:07.470> win<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.250> vehicle

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
will be doing a full win of this vehicle

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.780 
will be doing a full win of this vehicle
at<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.570> end<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.869> video<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.560> no<00:01:11.490> fast

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
at the very end of this video so no fast

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.899 
at the very end of this video so no fast

done I've pretty much completed it I'm
ready<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.250> start<00:01:17.430> testing<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.390> just

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
ready to start testing it out I just

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
ready to start testing it out I just
have<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.740> tires<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.400> glue<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.090> see

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
have some tires to glue up you will see

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.179 
have some tires to glue up you will see
the<00:01:21.420> tires<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> have

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the tires on there I just kind of have

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.370 
the tires on there I just kind of have
them<00:01:23.310> form<00:01:23.610> fitted<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> could

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
them form fitted right now so I could

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.910 
them form fitted right now so I could
cut<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.710> video<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:27.170> my<00:01:28.170> last<00:01:28.320> video<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> kind

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
cut this video so my last video I kind

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
cut this video so my last video I kind
of<00:01:28.979> went<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.869> nooks<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of went over all of the the nooks and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.980 
of went over all of the the nooks and
crannies<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:32.159> everything<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.720> over<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
crannies of everything I will go over it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
crannies of everything I will go over it
one<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.159> guys<00:01:35.400> got<00:01:35.610> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
one more time just so you guys got it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.960 
one more time just so you guys got it
and<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.090> will<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> full<00:01:37.159> clickable<00:01:38.159> links

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and there will be a full clickable links

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090 
and there will be a full clickable links
list<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.960> video<00:01:40.200> description<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
list in the video description so you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.600 
list in the video description so you
know<00:01:41.520> exactly<00:01:41.759> where<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> parts<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.020> so

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
know exactly where I got the parts at so

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.490 
know exactly where I got the parts at so
pretty<00:01:44.610> much<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.619> take<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.860> low<00:01:47.700> CS<00:01:48.090> CTE<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.930> have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
pretty much you take a low CS CTE I have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.700 
pretty much you take a low CS CTE I have
not<00:01:49.710> messed<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.040> any<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> setup<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.659> my

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
not messed with any of the setup of my

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
not messed with any of the setup of my
SCT<00:01:52.710> II<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.850> much<00:01:54.030> gonna<00:01:54.210> run<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
SCT II I'm pretty much gonna run it the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.319 
SCT II I'm pretty much gonna run it the
way<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.140> had<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> short<00:01:56.610> course<00:01:56.820> truck<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
way I had as a short course truck and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.480 
way I had as a short course truck and
then<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.170> tune<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> from<00:01:58.680> there<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
then kind of tune it from there so I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.510 
then kind of tune it from there so I
left<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:01.079> diffs<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> same<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.040> shocks<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
left the diffs the same the shocks the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.389 
left the diffs the same the shocks the
same<00:02:02.790> all<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> same<00:02:03.659> set<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.320> far<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
same all the same set up as far as the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.180 
same all the same set up as far as the
suspension<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.930> we're<00:02:07.320> gonna<00:02:07.439> go<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:07.770> there

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
suspension and we're gonna go from there

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.270 
suspension and we're gonna go from there
I<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:09.360> rebuilt<00:02:09.780> everything<00:02:10.679> though<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> took

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I have rebuilt everything though I took

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880 
I have rebuilt everything though I took
every<00:02:12.560> difficult

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
every difficult

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.560 
every difficult
and<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.580> made<00:02:14.760> sure<00:02:14.790> everything<00:02:15.390> was

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and kind of made sure everything was

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.740 
and kind of made sure everything was
good<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.500> eight<00:02:17.130> skill<00:02:17.520> buggy<00:02:18.300> concept

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
good so this eight skill buggy concept

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
good so this eight skill buggy concept
gets<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> fair<00:02:19.830> chance<00:02:20.060> now<00:02:21.470> some<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> major

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
gets a fair chance now some of the major

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.320 
gets a fair chance now some of the major
parts<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.520> need<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> get<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.300> need

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
little bit thicker stub axle so I found

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.280 
little bit thicker stub axle so I found
these<00:02:57.900> from<00:02:58.620> m2c<00:02:59.430> racing<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.690> far<00:03:00.959> as<00:03:01.080> wheels

you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.739> pretty<00:03:01.890> much<00:03:01.980> use<00:03:02.280> any<00:03:02.489> eight<00:03:02.850> scale

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300

downforce<00:03:24.630> wing<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.580> that's<00:03:26.580> basically<00:03:27.060> you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
downforce wing and that's basically you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
downforce wing and that's basically you
do<00:03:27.510> need<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.690> buggy<00:03:27.959> body<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.560> ended<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.160> using

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
do need a buggy body I ended up using

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.800 
do need a buggy body I ended up using
the<00:03:29.640> body<00:03:30.390> from<00:03:30.750> an<00:03:30.900> 810<00:03:31.560> from<00:03:32.310> low<00:03:32.489> C<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.910> had<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.440 
the body from an 810 from low C I had to
somewhat<00:03:34.730> customize<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.940> because<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.269> doesn't

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
somewhat customize it because it doesn't

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.199 
somewhat customize it because it doesn't
fit<00:03:36.720> exactly<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.340> body<00:03:38.610> posts<00:03:39.090> are<00:03:39.180> a
