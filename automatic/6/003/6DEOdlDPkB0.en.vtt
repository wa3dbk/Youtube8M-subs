00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
glass is flame work glass which could

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
glass is flame work glass which could

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
best be described as drawing with glass

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
best be described as drawing with glass
for<00:01:06.600> example<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> art<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
for example the art that you see here is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
for example the art that you see here is
made<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.119> special<00:01:09.720> type<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> glass

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
rods call borosilicate folks folks might
know<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.750> otherwise<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.380> Pyrex<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.340> yes

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
know it otherwise it's Pyrex really yes

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
know it otherwise it's Pyrex really yes
so<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:18.119> sturdy<00:01:18.659> very<00:01:19.020> hard<00:01:19.350> type<00:01:19.680> of
