00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.710
 2025 good many people still with the doubt 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.240
 if this map is in the map rotation 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.830
 which is a rotation of magicians for the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.510
 people who are new is for example when 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.460
 you go here 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.340
 and good is because any any 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.090
 fire mode I could put I want to buy 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.420
 for example 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.150
 and many people believe that the new town 2005 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.500
 are on the random maps that we're going 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.080
 to play here but I was looking 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.590
 Searching and searching and searching 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.170
 the tweets of bilbao ander hard 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.030
 look very well at what he said because 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.810
 one thing is you can say we remove the map 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 I was in 2025 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:54.600
 the good the game mode but of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 suddenly confirmed that it is not in the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.949
 more to change and you when you play 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.960
 kirk con fer timerman free for all 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.790
 domination what you want you are not going to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.780
 find because this video because there 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.659
 people who are now working 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 studying as I said when I did 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 the first video of the cni opting 25 and me 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.860
 they keep asking if the gameplay 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.119
 of newtown is on the nerd playlist 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.530
 comment church and do not comment on 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.690
 Spanish and it's not there and it's not ok 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.810
 in hardcore is also not and search and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.940
 apart from the fight, whether to say the same 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.940
 is to have it for the purpose of being here 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.039
 and you're only going to be able to use it 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.310
 the day so creating this game not with 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.869
 your friends nothing more 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.280
 if there is nothing left with your friends which is 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.280
 a crap for example here 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.750
 where is with the setup games change 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.710
 map and the new town there we will not force 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.770
 in and they chose nothing else 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.500
 and there just with your friends is no longer going 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.090
 to be multiplayer for nothing good 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.140
 I follow two colleagues if not but to play 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.729
 with others with other people, not me 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.800
 I ask the people who made the pre 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.980
 order more than anything supposedly not the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.680
 worse said it makes the worst of white 2i you're going 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.620
 to be able to enjoy the map I liked man 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.160
 25 and blah blah blah blah a lot of people and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.770
 always order he goes back to explain 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.410
 do but lose is a crap is 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.120
 a sincerely babe practically 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.269
 ensure the sale of the game 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.230
 because suddenly you say something is the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.300
 problem but in the end if the game does not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.160
 like cyber reviews 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.930
 you can return the money yes but no 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.460
 I think they speak to you all exact or 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.830
 suddenly with your five dollars that you've 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.200
 made of pre order and the people of 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.780
 activision already took 30 dollars to make 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.270
 or not already playing against money so 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.490
 gentlemen there is no injecting 95 for nothing 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.760
 erased more than in special events 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.440
 as many as double points and so on 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.090
 clarifying something else so that it does not 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.700
 confuse remember that the head of 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.220
 all this is is to activision after 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.500
 activision follows 3 erc and after 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.060
 bring follow the beat potter jarquin said 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.920
 also that the map was going to be all 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.980
 fucking day and not deliver to leave the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.330
 white 2 but in the end it's not like that 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.250
 gentlemen so much for play 3 360 there is not that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.790
 neither of having for pc and for wii or 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.620
 I suppose 5 suddenly if there is not for the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.330
 will you people or that would be very 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.250
 stupid suddenly that the 90 for 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.810
 them but I think that there will be you 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.560
 very safe but it is believed to correct me in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.750
 the comments 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.060
 so confirmed one hundred percent 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.460
 I had the doubt at home or at your school 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.430
 I liked 2005 it will not be more 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.340
 yes until next notice which I'm 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.200
 sure it's going to be suddenly in order to 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.020
 this month or in the month of December when 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.750
 leave the first day like that of black ops 2 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.550
 if I say goodbye I was dukes to the favorite 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.290
 comment please think that 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.970
 especially the people who did 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
 pre-order is what interests me the most 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.470
 know I've done worse in the middle of 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.170
 map or I know what people think 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.270
 who did pre-order is what I most 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.010
 would like to know well discuss among the 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.440
 who did preorder and those who did not 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.380
 they did worse this game must be that 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.420
 is starting badly very bad servers 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.090
 Bad domination in my voice and not personal 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.590
 I do not like it and now I'm dictated that 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.390
 does not like anyone I guess I think 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.610
 we have to be upset about the removal 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.040
 of maps of newtown 2025 so I 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.170
 dismissed a hug I started very well 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.420
 gentlemen I would like to read your opinions and 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.420
 obviously we'll see each other until the next
