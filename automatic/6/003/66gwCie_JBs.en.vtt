00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
highlighting kit also but the thing that
I<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.020> about<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.070> very

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
I don't like about that is it's very

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.940 
I don't like about that is it's very
inconsistent<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.689> you'll<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> streak<00:02:04.799> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
inconsistent so you'll have a streak of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.219 
inconsistent so you'll have a streak of
hair<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.640> it'll<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.149> highlighted<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229

hair have it'll be highlighted and the
other<00:02:07.350> half<00:02:07.590> will<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.840> taking

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
other half will be not so that's taking

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199 
other half will be not so that's taking
too<00:02:10.349> big<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> risk<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.819> you're<00:02:12.180> planning

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209

strands through I never did that because

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.090 
strands through I never did that because
I<00:03:01.860> was<00:03:02.190> not<00:03:02.340> able<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.880> get<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.540> my<00:03:04.200> room<00:03:04.500> enough

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
I was not able to get to my room enough

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.340 
I was not able to get to my room enough
coming<00:03:06.090> through<00:03:06.240> that<00:03:06.270> little<00:03:06.540> hole<00:03:06.690> like

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
coming through that little hole like

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080 
coming through that little hole like
it'll<00:03:07.740> get<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.070> tips<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.580> hair<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.000> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
it'll get the tips of the hair but it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.330 
it'll get the tips of the hair but it
never<00:03:09.240> got<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.660> root<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.530> what<00:03:10.710> I<00:03:10.740> did<00:03:10.860> was<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
never got the root so what I did was the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.310 
never got the root so what I did was the
foil<00:03:11.670> method<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.720> want<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.960> look<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
foil method so if you want to look that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.040 
foil method so if you want to look that
up<00:03:13.380> then<00:03:14.010> yeah<00:03:14.610> that's<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.120> technique<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.990> I

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
up then yeah that's the technique that I

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.449 
up then yeah that's the technique that I
used<00:03:16.350> when<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.710> was<00:03:16.830> actually<00:03:17.010> using<00:03:17.310> the
