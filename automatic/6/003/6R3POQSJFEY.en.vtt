start testing with I found that it was
about<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> 15<00:02:50.750> gigabyte<00:02:51.110> download<00:02:51.770> which

about a 15 gigabyte download which

about a 15 gigabyte download which
wasn't<00:02:52.280> too<00:02:52.550> bad<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.030> took<00:02:53.180> around<00:02:53.330> maybe<00:02:53.720> half

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
wasn't too bad it took around maybe half

wasn't too bad it took around maybe half
an<00:02:54.170> hour<00:02:54.290> for<00:02:54.470> me<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.590> download<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.430> don't

an hour for me to download that I don't

all the issues that are being reported
so<00:03:35.960> that's<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.320> program<00:03:36.470> pretty<00:03:37.220> much<00:03:37.370> in<00:03:37.550> its

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
so that's the program pretty much in its

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.820 
so that's the program pretty much in its
entirety<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:38.780> can<00:03:38.960> then<00:03:39.110> use<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.590> test

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
entirety you can then use the test

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.130 
entirety you can then use the test
servers<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.610> sort<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.120> test<00:03:41.330> for<00:03:41.540> bugs<00:03:41.720> just

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
servers to sort of test for bugs just

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.510 
servers to sort of test for bugs just

they will actually stress the service
completely<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.490> won't<00:03:52.610> force<00:03:53.060> people

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
completely so that it won't force people

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.270 
completely so that it won't force people
to<00:03:53.510> rubberband<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.380> things<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:54.920> just

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
to rubberband and things like that just

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.610 
to rubberband and things like that just
so<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.940> they<00:03:56.000> can<00:03:56.180> see<00:03:56.420> how<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.080> servers

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
so that they can see how the servers

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.230 
so that they can see how the servers
actually<00:03:57.770> perform<00:03:58.400> under<00:03:58.580> heavy<00:03:58.910> load

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
actually perform under heavy load

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.910 
actually perform under heavy load
because<00:03:59.930> they<00:04:00.050> want<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.440> with<00:04:00.620> different

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
because they want to see with different

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.100 
because they want to see with different
people's<00:04:01.190> configurations<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.120> PCs<00:04:02.570> setups

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
and things like that

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.580 
and things like that
just<00:04:04.400> how<00:04:04.520> well<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.820> game<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.510> run<00:04:05.540> with<00:04:06.410> this

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
just how well the game can run with this

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.550 
just how well the game can run with this
new<00:04:06.770> code<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.220> they<00:04:07.370> have<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:08.750> program<00:04:09.020> is

out<00:04:19.010> new<00:04:19.489> things<00:04:19.520> for<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.060> game<00:04:20.270> before<00:04:20.690> it

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
out new things for the game before it

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.540 
out new things for the game before it
actually<00:04:21.140> comes<00:04:21.410> out<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.250> what<00:04:22.430> you're

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
actually comes out so what you're

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.790 
actually comes out so what you're
getting<00:04:22.820> is<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.060> sort<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.480> pre<00:04:23.810> premium<00:04:24.260> look

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
getting is a sort of a pre premium look

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.640 
getting is a sort of a pre premium look
at<00:04:25.220> what<00:04:25.490> battlefield<00:04:26.030> 4<00:04:26.180> could<00:04:26.420> be<00:04:26.570> like<00:04:26.780> when

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
at what battlefield 4 could be like when

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.710 
at what battlefield 4 could be like when
a<00:04:27.920> proper<00:04:28.340> update<00:04:28.670> rolls<00:04:28.940> out<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.510> full

a proper update rolls out for the full
game<00:04:29.990> now<00:04:30.830> this<00:04:31.430> kind<00:04:31.670> of<00:04:31.850> system<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.570> really

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
game now this kind of system is really

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.440 
game now this kind of system is really
good<00:04:33.290> now<00:04:33.470> for<00:04:33.680> battlefield<00:04:34.100> 4<00:04:34.310> obviously<00:04:34.910> we

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
good now for battlefield 4 obviously we

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.110 
good now for battlefield 4 obviously we
are<00:04:35.630> 7<00:04:36.020> months<00:04:36.260> after<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.620> release<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.580> little

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
are 7 months after a release so a little

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.430 
are 7 months after a release so a little
bit<00:04:38.240> behind<00:04:38.510> schedule<00:04:38.690> probably<00:04:39.290> with

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
bit behind schedule probably with

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.540 
bit behind schedule probably with
something<00:04:39.680> like<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:39.950> coming<00:04:40.250> out<00:04:40.340> but

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
something like this coming out but

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.180 
something like this coming out but
nevertheless<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.330> is<00:04:41.540> here<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.140> as<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:43.010> know

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
nevertheless it is here and as we know

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.850 
nevertheless it is here and as we know
EA<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:44.180> an<00:04:44.390> unannounced<00:04:44.900> shooter<00:04:45.500> that's

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
EA have an unannounced shooter that's

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.860 
EA have an unannounced shooter that's
going<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:46.280> be<00:04:46.400> revealed<00:04:46.790> at<00:04:47.090> e3<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.810> year

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
going to be revealed at e3 this year

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.360 
going to be revealed at e3 this year
bill<00:04:48.680> on<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.100> frostbite<00:04:49.640> 3<00:04:49.880> n

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
bill on the frostbite 3 n

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.430 
bill on the frostbite 3 n
so<00:04:51.060> some<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.540> developments<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.290> we

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
so some of the developments that we

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.409 
so some of the developments that we
could<00:04:52.650> make<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.520> program<00:04:54.030> here<00:04:54.270> with

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
could make in this program here with

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.629 
could make in this program here with
battlefield<00:04:54.720> 4<00:04:54.960> could<00:04:55.889> potentially

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
battlefield 4 could potentially

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.090 
battlefield 4 could potentially
translate<00:04:57.180> across<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.930> EAS<00:04:58.290> new<00:04:58.620> shooter

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
translate across to EAS new shooter

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.280 
translate across to EAS new shooter
which<00:04:59.639> means<00:04:59.880> overall<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.690> engine<00:05:01.050> will<00:05:01.169> be

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
which means overall the engine will be

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.830 
which means overall the engine will be
better<00:05:01.470> developed<00:05:02.040> more<00:05:02.490> fluid<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.180> would

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
better developed more fluid and would

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.750 
better developed more fluid and would
probably<00:05:04.199> work<00:05:04.380> better<00:05:04.620> overall<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.639> think

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
probably work better overall so I think

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
probably work better overall so I think
it's<00:05:06.000> beneficial

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
it's beneficial

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.370 
it's beneficial

things that dice want to look at is the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.140 
things that dice want to look at is the
netcode<00:05:16.889> it's<00:05:17.220> pretty<00:05:17.430> much<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.880> biggest

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150

problem with battlefield 4 and it says

we<00:05:23.250> will<00:05:23.400> work<00:05:23.610> on<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.450> netcode<00:05:24.840> which<00:05:25.440> is

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
we will work on is the netcode which is

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.320 
we will work on is the netcode which is
what<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> player<00:05:26.070> experiences<00:05:26.850> with<00:05:27.210> the

this<00:05:32.040> involves<00:05:32.639> tweaking<00:05:33.450> the<00:05:33.600> tick<00:05:33.870> rate<00:05:34.169> of
