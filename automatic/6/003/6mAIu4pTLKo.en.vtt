00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.189
 hello, I'm not the same as studying 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.259
 architecture buenavista ambassador of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 habitissimo and I'll give you a couple of 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.300
 Tips on how to decorate a floor 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.300
 small 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 well what is the objective that is what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.180
 we pretend therefore it is evident what 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.880
 we pretend that it looks like what it is not 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.850
 What we are looking for is that it looks more 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.590
 great and this how we got it good 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.470
 Well, we're going to have to play especially 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.110
 with the light with the textures the colors 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.060
 and above all, look for space to flow 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.610
 in the distribution is to say unify 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.850
 spaces we will have to join kitchen with 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.370
 dining room with living room even if it is 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.320
 necessary the bedroom and it is even more 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 the bathroom does not have to be a bath 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.490
 three square meters isolated on a 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.290
 corner but we can exploit the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.900
 bathtub or the shower tray can be 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 outside like the sink 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.480
 and what color we do not paint good in this 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.340
 I'm not going to give you many options is a 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.620
 my personal opinion surely a lot 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.980
 people share it and many of you are 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.650
 agreement what color then the white 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.710
 and we can not use another man the white 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 is the one that will give you more luminosity and is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.390
 the one that will give you that feeling that is 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.150
 bigger is something that although it seems 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.130
 bigger obviously we can 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.110
 combine with some touch of color in 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.500
 others on another side some light gray 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.360
 some contrast but very punctual or 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.470
 even also combine it with the tone 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.470
 ground 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.659
 you have to get the most out of it 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.520
 we can natural light in natural light 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.190
 is the one that can give us this feeling 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.500
 of amplitude that we do not have or that is scarce 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.420
 do not be afraid to place a 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.430
 large window especially if we have a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 Clear space is to say the floor can 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.400
 be small but maybe we have behind 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.069
 a view towards the sea ​​or towards 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.620
 mountain then a large window gives 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.380
 that feeling of depth and it will look 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.450
 that has greater amplitude and where there is 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.610
 natural liking would use halogen light 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.190
 always recessed spotlights would not place 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.120
 hanging lamps that is to say I would love 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.209
 more for webs or eyes and also 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.640
 use the resource of a focal light in 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.890
 a certain point is to say that when 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.470
 someone between then they give a greater emphasis 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.519
 to an area to a box so that the view 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.519
 go to that place 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.900
 the minimalist style or the style 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.819
 modernist are very suitable for a 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.650
 small floor especially for the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.020
 practical that are these furniture are 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.440
 very simple furniture very pure lines 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.090
 very white with a lot of capacity and we 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 will help a lot to configure these 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.430
 spaces so small if we opt 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.120
 for a vintage or more rustic style very 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.190
 overloaded is not going to stay that way 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.000
 stay also and then when the kind of 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.120
 furniture 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.760
 Well, look better than a 135 bed 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.530
 a bed of 180 if we can place a 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.440
 I canapé that we can store objects in their 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.920
 inside so much the better a dish 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.170
 shower instead of bathtub is always saying 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.150
 look for furniture that is useful and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.880
 time then reduce the space to the minimum 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.340
 I hope these tips have been 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.680
 useful and if you want to continue learning
