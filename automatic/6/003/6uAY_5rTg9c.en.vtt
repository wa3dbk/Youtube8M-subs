just<00:00:45.660> look<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> count<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> framerate

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
just look at you can count the framerate

admittedly<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.350> when<00:01:25.500> the

admittedly this is from time when the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
very concept of draw distance was kind

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.570 
very concept of draw distance was kind
of<00:01:27.659> alien<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> most<00:01:28.320> people<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.310> took<00:01:29.460> a

of alien to most people and this took a

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.310 
of alien to most people and this took a
special<00:01:29.880> microchip<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:30.810> order<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.050> make<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
special microchip in order to make it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
special microchip in order to make it
happen<00:01:31.679> this<00:01:32.340> machine<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.149> also<00:01:33.360> gave<00:01:33.690> us

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
happen this machine which also gave us

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
happen this machine which also gave us
everything<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.530> Final<00:01:34.950> Fantasy<00:01:35.340> 6<00:01:35.610> to

everything from Final Fantasy 6 to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
everything from Final Fantasy 6 to
Donkey<00:01:36.330> Kong<00:01:36.539> Country<00:01:36.830> needed<00:01:37.830> extra

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
Donkey Kong Country needed extra

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
Donkey Kong Country needed extra
firepower<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.390> 3d<00:01:39.929> racing<00:01:40.170> game<00:01:40.649> look

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
firepower to make a 3d racing game look

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.419 
firepower to make a 3d racing game look
like<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> why<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> gap<00:01:44.220> between

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
like this this is why the gap between

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.219 
like this this is why the gap between
the<00:01:44.700> fourth<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.030> fifth<00:01:45.119> generations<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the fourth and fifth generations was so

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
the fourth and fifth generations was so
awkward<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:47.039> were<00:01:47.130> rebuilding<00:01:47.369> everything<00:01:47.909> in

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
awkward we were rebuilding everything in

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.469 
awkward we were rebuilding everything in
a<00:01:49.409> third<00:01:49.649> dimension

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.850 

no<00:01:57.110> yeah<00:01:57.289> racing<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:59.200> go<00:02:00.200> around<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.590> track

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
no yeah racing you go around a track

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.279 
no yeah racing you go around a track

fairness to other cars and the
motorcycle<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.979> believe<00:02:10.970> there<00:02:11.120> are<00:02:11.150> some

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
motorcycle I believe there are some

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.670 
motorcycle I believe there are some
pretty<00:02:11.450> cool<00:02:11.540> effects<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:12.110> an<00:02:12.200> echo<00:02:12.530> when

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
pretty cool effects like an echo when

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.080 
pretty cool effects like an echo when
you<00:02:12.769> enter<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.130> tunnel<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.610> water<00:02:13.790> area

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
you enter this tunnel in the water area

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.330 
you enter this tunnel in the water area
and<00:02:16.720> Mario<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.019> Fox<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.620> Kirby<00:02:18.890> posters

height<00:02:20.269> differences<00:02:20.870> that's<00:02:20.989> something

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
height differences that's something

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.259 
height differences that's something
there<00:02:21.470> hadn't<00:02:21.769> been<00:02:21.920> before<00:02:22.069> right<00:02:22.519> alright

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
there hadn't been before right alright

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.000 
there hadn't been before right alright
so<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:23.599> just<00:02:23.690> check<00:02:24.080> point<00:02:24.319> based<00:02:24.560> racing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
so it's just check point based racing

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.100 
so it's just check point based racing
that's<00:02:25.130> rather<00:02:25.459> awkwardly<00:02:25.940> timed<00:02:26.299> a<00:02:26.629> couple

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that's rather awkwardly timed a couple

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.830 
that's rather awkwardly timed a couple
situations<00:02:27.260> saw<00:02:27.709> me<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:27.950> first<00:02:28.190> place<00:02:28.430> and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
situations saw me in first place and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.809 
situations saw me in first place and
still<00:02:29.840> timing<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.430> let's<00:02:31.610> leave<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
still timing out so let's leave the

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.729 
still timing out so let's leave the
races<00:02:32.269> behind<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.810> turn<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> trick<00:02:33.500> mode

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
races behind and turn to the trick mode

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.069 
races behind and turn to the trick mode
which<00:02:34.069> isn't<00:02:34.819> really<00:02:35.269> about<00:02:35.360> tricks<00:02:35.810> at<00:02:35.959> all

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
which isn't really about tricks at all

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.809 
which isn't really about tricks at all
but<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.380> about<00:02:36.560> braving<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.220> perils<00:02:37.610> of

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
but is about braving the perils of

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.390 
but is about braving the perils of
variable<00:02:38.360> terrain<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.930> order<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> collect<00:02:40.069> all

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
variable terrain in order to collect all

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:49.440 
variable terrain in order to collect all
the<00:02:40.459> stars<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.980> stars<00:02:42.980> all

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.470 

so<00:02:50.450> wild<00:02:50.870> Trax<00:02:51.200> aka<00:02:51.770> stunt<00:02:52.220> race<00:02:52.400> FX<00:02:52.640> doesn't

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so wild Trax aka stunt race FX doesn't

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.330 
so wild Trax aka stunt race FX doesn't
really<00:02:53.660> stand<00:02:53.960> up<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.200> today's<00:02:54.500> standards<00:02:55.100> or
