00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
minutes and went through a bunch of

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.810 
minutes and went through a bunch of
outer<00:05:10.610> ops<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.560> did<00:05:12.560> probably<00:05:13.220> like<00:05:13.490> 10<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.730> them

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820

played<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.780> couple<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.350> main<00:05:15.920> missions<00:05:16.810> and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
played a couple of main missions and

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.700 
played a couple of main missions and
this<00:05:20.090> was<00:05:20.330> happening<00:05:20.480> so<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:21.230> looked<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.680> up

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
this was happening so I looked it up

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.930 
this was happening so I looked it up
online<00:05:21.920> and<00:05:22.310> sure<00:05:23.270> enough<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:23.810> will<00:05:24.380> not<00:05:24.940> be

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
online and sure enough you will not be

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.290 
online and sure enough you will not be
able<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.210> gain<00:05:26.360> trophy<00:05:26.810> support<00:05:27.140> with<00:05:28.300> already

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
able to gain trophy support with already

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.590 
able to gain trophy support with already
created<00:05:29.930> saved<00:05:30.620> data<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:31.190> know<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.180> set<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.450> on

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
created saved data I know it set it on

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.950 
created saved data I know it set it on
there<00:05:32.810> but<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.320> thought<00:05:34.190> yeah<00:05:34.690> maybe<00:05:35.690> just

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
there but I thought yeah maybe just

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.610 
there but I thought yeah maybe just
wouldn't<00:05:36.230> auto<00:05:36.410> import<00:05:36.890> it<00:05:37.040> but<00:05:37.280> apparently

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
wouldn't auto import it but apparently

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.340 
wouldn't auto import it but apparently
you<00:05:39.620> won't<00:05:39.800> get<00:05:39.950> them<00:05:40.040> at<00:05:40.130> all<00:05:40.220> so<00:05:41.110> pretty<00:05:42.110> much

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
you won't get them at all so pretty much

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.380 
you won't get them at all so pretty much
the<00:05:43.280> only<00:05:43.340> way<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.650> gain<00:05:45.670> trophies<00:05:46.670> is<00:05:48.310> to

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
the only way to gain trophies is to

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.770 
the only way to gain trophies is to
start<00:05:50.390> a<00:05:50.450> whole<00:05:50.600> new<00:05:50.750> game

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
start a whole new game

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.520 
start a whole new game
