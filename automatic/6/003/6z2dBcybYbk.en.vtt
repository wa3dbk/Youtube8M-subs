00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.129
 let's see how we model an arm 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.870
 Well, we do as we always have 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.929
 had flesh color fondant and we put him 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.969
 a little cmc and we always knead 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.219
 we do the same thing all the time and you see 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.570
 we are doing the same thing we put a 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.640
 little fat on your hands so you do not 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.769
 hit us and now what are we going to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.650
 to do is always like a ball so 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.370
 thereafter make a cylinder as 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.770
 nothing, let's make that ball 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.590
 and now we have to lengthen to make 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.000
 a cylinder we make a cylinder and what 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.580
 let's do is cut this cylinder 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.100
 in half as always so that for 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.200
 that we are able to have two arms 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 same then already with one of the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.430
 cylinders what I do is mark a little 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.130
 where will the hand go and the rest I do 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.780
 finest from where marked it 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.730
 What I do is stretch it a little more to 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.440
 make it thinner once I've done 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.660
 that what I do is mark the elbow say 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.420
 I bend where the elbow is going and I do it 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.220
 with my this here a couple of strips 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.769
 as if they were the folds of the elbow 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.620
 you see and now what I do is the part of 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.170
 up the flat tires because that's what 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.790
 is going to be stuck to my figure we are going to do 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.410
 the hand to do the hand first thing is 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.150
 make the big toe the big toe if you 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.000
 you fix in your hands more always 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.950
 inside towards the body and once 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 I do the big toe I frame it cut and 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.280
 Now what I do is round up what 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.470
 the process with the other fingers is going to be 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.180
 same but the short ones and then the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.840
 rounding to cut first I'm going to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.990
 mark in the hand then three more stripes or 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 less of the same that are equal for 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.230
 my fingers are more or less 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.350
 same and now what I do is mark 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.330
 the cut and once I cut it equal 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
 that in the big toe I'm going to round with 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 very careful mouths very tiny every 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 one of the fingers I said a thousand times 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 in this course I think we can get to the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 detail that we want but neither is it so 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.650
 interesting to get to the end 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 we mark a tint the uÃ±itas and 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.800
 If you want, you can do the other 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.660
 wrinkles of the fingers that you like 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.490
 but for me this hand is more than 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.760
 we would do the same for the other 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.260
 side 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.260
 it's like symmetric
