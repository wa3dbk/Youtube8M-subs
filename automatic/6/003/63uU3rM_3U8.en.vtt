00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.400
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.720
 teach how to make tomato chips 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 good to make some crunchy 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.090
 tomato in this case of what the skin is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 of the tomato taking advantage of that we had 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.260
 some scalded tomatoes you can see in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.590
 the video that we have posted on our 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.800
 channel 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.800
 what we do is we simply extract 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.580
 the skin 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.270
 We deposit it on wax paper in 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.730
 you can do it on any 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 type of paper because this is not going to 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 hit because it does not go to the oven 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.410
 we simply extract them as large 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.410
 possible 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.180
 and now let's pick up with help a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.910
 absorbent paper the largest amount 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.360
 of possible humidity to accelerate the 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.010
 dehydration process of these 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.010
 tomato petals 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.160
 we 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.960
 taking advantage of the fact that it is very hot in 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.530
 cook over the stove simply 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.930
 let's put this tray and with the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.780
 own heat will be losing moisture 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 in the houses you can make it in the oven 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.990
 160 degrees of temperature 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.670
 I'm going to put it in a very hot place 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.270
 in the sun or on top of a radiator 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.270
 like you 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.200
 and then once you have lost 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.060
 the humidity will be passed through oil to 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.220
 about 140 degrees and you'll see that it's a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.900
 pretty good result from here 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.970
 we could derive and make dust 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.160
 tomato perfectly 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.620
 good what I told you now this 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.090
 we are going to leave it for a space 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.700
 which can range from 24 to 36 hours 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.920
 until it loses good moisture a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.410
 once we have taken it out we have dehydrated 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.740
 the tomato skins you see that not yet 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.000
 they are very crisp I still have 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.710
 things what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.030
 put them in the oil the oil does not have 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.400
 to be very hot because these are 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.790
 those who marÃ­a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.430
 should range between 130 140 and 45 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.079
 degrees we are going to do is going to be put 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.079
 all skins at the same time 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.810
 and with the help of the spatula 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.460
 for we would take it out we had the chips 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460
 tomato 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.380
 we're just going to let the paper 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.900
 absorbent pick up the excess fat 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.930
 and now in the cold we will introduce you and what 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.880
 we will show with the final consistency 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.070
 Well, look, this is the result 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.310
 final we would talk now I rolled up 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.110
 a little hot 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.170
 and these would be the chips or ones 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.480
 crunchy tomato is right now the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.620
 result now yes it is brittle 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.690
 and it's a very good way to give a 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.540
 useful to the skins that on the other hand 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.580
 usually they usually do without 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.159
 of them and be our way of doing 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.159
 chips or crunchy tomato skin
