is not only are we supposed to prolong
the<00:00:13.530> end<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.830> life<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.639> we're<00:00:14.730> supposed<00:00:14.849> to

make life better and sometimes we do

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.160 
make life better and sometimes we do
better<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> former<00:00:18.270> prolonging<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> end

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
better at the former prolonging the end

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
better at the former prolonging the end
of<00:00:19.289> life<00:00:19.500> rather<00:00:20.189> than<00:00:20.310> making<00:00:20.640> life<00:00:20.970> better

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
of life rather than making life better

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.070 
of life rather than making life better
throughout<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.859> know<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.189> end<00:00:23.480> no<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.720> mean<00:00:24.930> is

feelings the coping mechanisms yeah what
we<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.610> combine<00:00:42.030> Western<00:00:42.600> psychology

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
we do is we combine Western psychology

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.340 
we do is we combine Western psychology
which<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> our<00:00:44.340> thoughts<00:00:44.809> because<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.960> believe

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
which is our thoughts because we believe

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.549 
which is our thoughts because we believe
that<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.950> much<00:00:47.250> comes<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:48.300> our<00:00:48.480> thoughts<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that so much comes from our thoughts so

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.910 
that so much comes from our thoughts so
if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.010> become<00:00:50.460> obsessed<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.680> oh

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
if you become obsessed and you think oh

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.700 
if you become obsessed and you think oh
my<00:00:53.219> gosh<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.699> am<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> live<00:00:54.710> then

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
my gosh you am I going to live then

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.369 
my gosh you am I going to live then
you're<00:00:55.949> locked<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.640> fear<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.539> then<00:00:57.989> somehow

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
you're locked in fear and then somehow

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.380 
you're locked in fear and then somehow
physically<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> comes<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.730> which<00:01:00.030> often

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
physically it comes out which often

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.819 
physically it comes out which often
comes<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> doctor's<00:01:01.469> office<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
comes up to the doctor's office and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
comes up to the doctor's office and
physical<00:01:02.340> symptoms<00:01:02.730> by<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.180> when<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
physical symptoms by the way when the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
physical symptoms by the way when the
backs<00:01:03.660> aching<00:01:04.019> when<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.680> you're

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
backs aching when really you're

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
backs aching when really you're
terrified<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> die<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.049> work

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
terrified you're going to die so we work

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.880 
terrified you're going to die so we work
on<00:01:07.680> changing<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.820> thought<00:01:09.270> process<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> we

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
on changing the thought process and we

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.960 
on changing the thought process and we
combine<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.210> Eastern<00:01:12.869> philosophy<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
combine that with Eastern philosophy of

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
combine that with Eastern philosophy of
working<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.110> mind<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.189> body<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
working with the mind the body the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.620 
working with the mind the body the
spirit<00:01:18.119> through<00:01:18.360> visualizations<00:01:19.460> music

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
spirit through visualizations music

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
spirit through visualizations music
relaxation<00:01:21.630> techniques<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.189> we've<00:01:23.490> really

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
relaxation techniques so we've really

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.660 
relaxation techniques so we've really
found<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.869> combination<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.610> two

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
found that the combination of these two

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.630 
found that the combination of these two
and<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> very<00:01:27.720> structured<00:01:28.380> model<00:01:29.280> with

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and we have a very structured model with

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
and we have a very structured model with
interventions<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.189> been<00:01:32.189> able<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
interventions that we have been able to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.719 
interventions that we have been able to
match<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.689> coping<00:01:34.229> style<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.430> by<00:01:35.670> using

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
match to your coping style so by using

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.319 
match to your coping style so by using
these<00:01:36.420> interventions<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.640> have

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
these interventions that's how we have

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.950 
these interventions that's how we have
gotten<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.380> evidence<00:01:41.310> base<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.479> research

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
gotten the evidence base in our research

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.950 
gotten the evidence base in our research
that<00:01:43.560> proves<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.250> works<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.689> mean

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that proves that it works and I mean

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280 
that proves that it works and I mean
it's<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.259> amazing<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.780> especially<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:49.079> end<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it's just amazing I especially an end of

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
it's just amazing I especially an end of
life<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:50.220> patients<00:01:50.460> call<00:01:50.939> me<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.659> they're

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
life I have patients call me as they're

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.499 
life I have patients call me as they're
dying<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.340> dying<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.450> were

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
dying as they're dying and they were

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
dying as they're dying and they were
terrified<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.560> die<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.430> course<00:01:56.670> nobody<00:01:56.850> like

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
terrified to die of course nobody like

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.899 
terrified to die of course nobody like
to<00:01:57.450> address<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.979> once<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.549> worked

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to address it and then once we worked

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.459 
to address it and then once we worked
with<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.270> interventions<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:01.079> they're

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
with these interventions as they're

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.100 
with these interventions as they're
dying<00:02:01.770> their<00:02:02.070> last<00:02:02.399> breath<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.509> really

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
dying their last breath is it really

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
dying their last breath is it really
works<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.070> am<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.149> peace<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.860> hope<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.160> didn't

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
works I am at peace and I hope I didn't

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.940 
works I am at peace and I hope I didn't
mess<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.670> your<00:02:08.849> research

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
mess up your research

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.699 
mess up your research
but<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:10.849> that's<00:02:11.239> that's<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.050> importance

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
but that's that's that's the importance

when<00:02:23.540> they<00:02:23.720> come<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.170> I'm<00:02:24.379> able<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.129> record

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
when they come in I'm able to record

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.670 
when they come in I'm able to record
their<00:02:26.030> psychological<00:02:26.510> symptoms<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.349> their

their psychological symptoms and their

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.130 
their psychological symptoms and their
physical<00:02:28.130> symptoms<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.390> physician<00:02:29.989> and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
physical symptoms so the physician and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.460 
physical symptoms so the physician and
myself<00:02:31.069> look<00:02:31.880> at<00:02:32.060> them<00:02:32.239> from<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.599> whole<00:02:32.959> person

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
myself look at them from a whole person

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.309 
myself look at them from a whole person
perspective<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:35.209> see<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:35.690> one<00:02:36.049> is

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
perspective and can see how one is

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.020 
perspective and can see how one is
working<00:02:37.190> with<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.430> other<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.000> think

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
working with the other and I think

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.699 
working with the other and I think
that's<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.599> biggest<00:02:38.780> disservice<00:02:39.319> in

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
that's the biggest disservice in

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.070 
that's the biggest disservice in
healthcare<00:02:40.340> today<00:02:40.519> is<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:41.660> are<00:02:41.690> not

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
healthcare today is that we are not

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.680 
healthcare today is that we are not
looking<00:02:42.590> at<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.069> patient<00:02:43.760> from<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.299> whole

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
looking at the patient from a whole

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.530 
looking at the patient from a whole
person<00:02:45.019> perspective<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:46.069> how<00:02:46.580> one<00:02:46.910> impacts

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
person perspective of how one impacts

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.690 
person perspective of how one impacts
the<00:02:47.660> other<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.290> most<00:02:48.560> likely<00:02:48.829> from<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.489> medical

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the other but most likely from a medical
