and you know you'll notice that these

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.769 
and you know you'll notice that these

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
are both on hopefully if they're not you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.170 
are both on hopefully if they're not you
might<00:00:30.960> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> turn<00:00:31.349> them<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.180> you're

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
might want to turn them on and you're

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.389 
might want to turn them on and you're
gonna<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> you're<00:00:34.680> gonna<00:00:34.770> turn<00:00:35.010> both

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
gonna go here and you're gonna turn both

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
gonna go here and you're gonna turn both
of<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.860> terraria<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.629> allowing

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
of them off because terraria is allowing

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.010 
of them off because terraria is allowing
other<00:00:39.809> people<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.579> use<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:42.000> server<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.660> it's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
other people to use your server so it's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
other people to use your server so it's
gonna<00:00:43.230> allow<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.120> computer

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
gonna allow them to get on your computer

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
gonna allow them to get on your computer
basically<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> turn

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
basically so you're gonna have to turn

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
basically so you're gonna have to turn
them<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.780> might<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.649> might<00:00:49.800> be

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
them off might not need to you might be

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.750 
them off might not need to you might be
able<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:51.739> allow<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
able to allow them through I don't I

basic port forwarding and this can take

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530 
basic port forwarding and this can take
quite<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.899> while<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.409> load<00:01:56.060> there<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
quite a while to load there we have it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.660 
quite a while to load there we have it
now<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> magic<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.680> video<00:01:59.310> editing

all<00:02:13.500> right<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.830> that's<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:15.230> port<00:02:16.230> forwarding

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
all right so that's the port forwarding

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.670 
all right so that's the port forwarding
it's<00:02:17.070> at<00:02:17.190> seven<00:02:17.490> seven<00:02:17.760> seven<00:02:17.940> seven<00:02:18.210> and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's at seven seven seven seven and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.960 
it's at seven seven seven seven and
you're<00:02:19.680> gonna<00:02:19.860> notice<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.460> local<00:02:20.790> IP

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you're gonna notice that the local IP

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.780 
you're gonna notice that the local IP
address<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.720> my<00:02:23.540> ipv4<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:25.380> has<00:02:25.560> changed

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
address is my ipv4 which has changed

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.440 
address is my ipv4 which has changed
which<00:02:26.790> would<00:02:27.180> X<00:02:28.040> dot<00:02:29.040> work<00:02:29.370> anymore<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.000> you're

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
which would X dot work anymore so you're

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
which would X dot work anymore so you're
gonna<00:02:30.570> go<00:02:30.750> into<00:02:31.020> here<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.440> you're<00:02:31.560> gonna<00:02:31.680> try

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
gonna go into here and you're gonna try

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.910 
gonna go into here and you're gonna try
and<00:02:32.130> find<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.940> every<00:02:33.600> every<00:02:34.350> router<00:02:34.740> is

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and find that every every router is

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.610 
and find that every every router is
different<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.580> try<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.270> find<00:02:36.510> where<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.290> port

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
different so try and find where the port

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.130 
different so try and find where the port
forwarding<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.250> where<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.570> inside<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
forwarding is where it is inside the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.410 
forwarding is where it is inside the
router<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.830> you're<00:02:41.190> gonna<00:02:41.280> find<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.730> managed
