00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.780
 for this video lesson a remake of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.540
 how to play before i forget dedicated to 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.280
 the most purist glass tuning so 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.520
 than starting from standard tuning 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.490
 we lower the tuning of the string 6 a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.760
 tone going from iu ad 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.070
 we would have a book and starting with a title 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.869
 we lower the tuning of each and every one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.689
 of the strings a tone and a half vouchers 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.840
 tuning is known as one and said 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.810
 half esther down beat drop 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.660
 forgive the beg pardon before anything 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.640
 the sound or noise that will follow from the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 guitar is the cheap 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.870
 wait with a lot of love is my first 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.870
 guitar so good we go with it 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.770
 the first day before anything say that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.100
 the hard boards are taken from a 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.379
 official book but there are small 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.809
 variations between some books and others 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.869
 as for example in the tortures that 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.199
 you saw then it would touch something 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.199
 as well 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.149
 and as you can see there are many notes because 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.409
 because there is one of the two strings and it is 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:21.000
 to the air that would really be a translated 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.000
 better for a silence then 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730
 OK 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.450
 now and fingers to the air two to the air 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 232 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.200
 of two and then air 32 follow the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.200
 tabs and rhythm little by little 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 as you see in the hard boards 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.110
 there is a zero more than what I am 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.110
 She is playing what would you say stay 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.030
 that I really like a lot is more 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.390
 entertaining to touch but change a little 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.890
 the accent of the theme is terry is what 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.890
 we repeat and it ends with one 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 fret 5 of the rope 6 with the seen yo 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.970
 what I'm touching are on the rope 6 the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.970
 reality is that the theme starts 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.260
 soft and then what it does is put the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.500
 I remembered power goes from two strings to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.500
 three 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.579
 as you already know to be a tuning 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.349
 based on using a single finger to 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.359
 the power chords as they match 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.090
 all on the same frets as the 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:46.349
 strings 6 5 and 4 so I'm going to repeat 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.349
 air two air 2 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.450
 and we make a game with the 32 and the air 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.170
 ok and we finish with 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 fret 5 strings and I left there they come to the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.630
 next part of the drift that is in the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.630
 fret 2 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.870
 you see some small trade to 3 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.510
 many times as you have just seen it will give you 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.519
 for playing it on the air and it's a small one 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.670
 law of doing it from the dead end 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.379
 al 2 is not the right thing but the truth is 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.970
 that looks pretty good so what 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.660
 I tell you, I always invite you to do 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.320
 your mobilizations 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.320
 reality 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360
 and let's go back to 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:43.319
 It's worth as you see the theme of sencillito 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.069
 we will continue seeing the next 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.069
 part of grays 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.239
 as you have seen, we play with the fret 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.140
 rossi al fret 3 the part of the theme are 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.140
 those two frets 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.450
 2 after 32 fret 3 again at 7 5 a 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.450
 the hour 5 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.500
 we make the same game ending in the 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.130
 trastevere cellular and masters again in the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.070
 fret 5 and the last time 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.180
 ok we would end up in fret 2 for 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.180
 move on to the next riff 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.000
 this manners 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.380
 we match the 2 and the rope if 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.380
 sabella to finish on the fret 5 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.820
 and those are the frets 8 and 7 of the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.940
 string 6 the first time ends in 8 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.940
 simply and the second time 87 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.889
 and to finish the gray we connect with 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.840
 what you have seen is in person 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.740
 fret 7 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.590
 87 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.590
 10 and 10 we go down to 5 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.840
 and the 5 we make 78 ways to decorate it 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:17.889
 but about doing 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.889
 finish 57 that would be to finish 5 7 8 7 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.610
 OK 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.050
 look at the detail that I bring here to 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.050
 a little pause everything stops there 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.320
 ok as you have seen the subject is 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.140
 I tend to learn the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.070
 mistakes we will quietly continue 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.070
 seeing the subject 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:00.410
 this we already saw in the other life lesson 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.410
 we play with the 3 345 of the rope 4 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.670
 we go down to 7 of the rope 3 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.869
 let's forgive that the 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.309
 game is very simple worth 54 of the 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:19.619
 rope 4 down to 7 of the rope 3 754 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:23.119
 a little playing with the 7 of the agreement to 4 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:23.119
 and it's just to keep up 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.560
 then improvise when it does not sound 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.470
 the nation but as you have seen 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.820
 following these notes is very simple 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:47.770
 attention part that the tables do not come 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.770
 hard but good nothing happens 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.300
 As you can see, play on the rope 5 in the air 2 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.990
 and 3 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.990
 OK 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.130
 the rhythm is very simple and this would be 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.630
 the topic before i forget what you see in 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.590
 the hard boards that ends in the 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.590
 fret 15 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.460
 It's very simple, just like silly 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:27.210
 a small 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:30.150
 this is because I hope that 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.569
 I liked that there was good 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.930
 the most purists are satisfied and 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:39.659
 always practice rehearsing do not let 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.460
 to visit and third dotcom and every time 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:45.439
 that I see this part of the video is me 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.439
 agreement that more or less up
