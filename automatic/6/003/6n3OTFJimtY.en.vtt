00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Well now cooks again and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.280
 cooks of the apprenticeships today we are going 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.309
 to present a pedagogical recipe a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 very interesting group dynamics 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.119
 to know yourself very interesting to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.699
 open that social self to expand that self 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 public to others and very interesting 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.240
 also for groups that even 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.300
 knowing each other you can meet a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.429
 little bit more fix to do this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 dynamic we need two things very 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.309
 simple a post-it packet and a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.950
 marker a package of positive a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.270
 marker or pen or marker 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.489
 I usually catch one of these a little more 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.440
 fat because then it looks better and in this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 dynamic is interesting to see 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 well the things that we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 divide the classroom into two groups 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 this dynamic works very well when 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.450
 they are groups to parties of 20 people is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.010
 say 10 and 10 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.860
 and this is going to be a kind of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.379
 competition between quotation marks of a group 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.770
 with another one to see which group guesses more 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:11.070
 hidden qualities of the other group and it's 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.140
 able to identify each person with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.810
 your quality I explain to you very briefly 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.970
 you divide the two groups to each group 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.550
 give a post-it pack and a marker 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.300
 a couple of them do not need many more 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.810
 you tell her that secretly working 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.270
 before both groups each person has to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.540
 put in a post-it or a quality 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.090
 special something that makes it unique because 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.900
 has therefore a special ability or a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.290
 best collector of so I know 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.510
 of coffee makers like me and nobody knew and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.970
 so then put it there or when 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.450
 example when I was little I was the queen 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.390
 of the festivals of my town for example 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.570
 no or I was once in the white house and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.370
 I met obama good is to say something 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.100
 special that has happened in your life 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.520
 a unique experience that you have had 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.160
 some merit some title or some trophy 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.580
 or a quality of yours that those of the other 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.260
 group do not know yet it's worth then 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.510
 Well, everyone writes their quality 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.070
 special in his post it I will see 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.490
 I have one here 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.240
 who says I was a soloist in a school of 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.340
 Béjar is worth a school because it is a 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.110
 a choir of children or I was the soloist of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.820
 s 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.220
 in the sanctuary a station of 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.970
 chestnut that work and work was not 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.340
 in there 22 years there I learned music 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.010
 I learned to sing and all those things because 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.090
 good people the decks suppose that 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.740
 this is in between the qualities of the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.990
 my group and the other group has to 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.910
 guess this quality to whoever 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.920
 I would paste who has painted the sung 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.010
 a good escolanía the question is the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.290
 next when each group has its 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.240
 post and put on we have a group of 20 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.930
 people with which there would be 10 0 1 and 10 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.510
 in another they are exchanged, they are 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.959
 they exchange and then it is that 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.910
 the other group has to guess 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.090
 putting the 10 people in the group 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.720
 opposite standing have to guess and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.480
 agree on which person 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.580
 may correspond each of the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.069
 qualities of skills or 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.850
 special experiences that are there 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.250
 OK 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.550
 it's an exercise where you have to work 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.890
 in a group you have to agree 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.560
 that making decisions must be guided by 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.500
 the perception of people to know 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.850
 who can hit who can 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.190
 these people that are here for example 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.380
 if it's someone who has been very athletic 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.900
 hey then who by the physical form that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.940
 has etcetera can be the person to the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.760
 what hits you is this be one today I've 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.850
 was the first dancer who would 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.860
 stick to be a dancer or I p dedicated to 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.750
 investigate who can be the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.030
 The group's researcher is a dynamic 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.740
 very interesting but then also by 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.440
 what I told you about going to 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.300
 help us to know even more of what 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.600
 that we know each other because we are going to reveal 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.820
 our talents our qualities 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.410
 our special abilities like 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.110
 says in the famous model of the window 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.910
 of home and you know that whose name is 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.340
 made from the union of the names of the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.380
 authors me and harry is the window of 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.660
 home and you know you have like four 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.720
 quadrants or four quadrants in 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.860
 function of what I know of me 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.900
 I do not know about myself and what the others 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.090
 you know about me 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.020
 there are four four quadrants the self 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.170
 public the I hidden the blind me and the I 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.300
 private not the objective of a group is 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.950
 that this public me every time he leaves 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.780
 making bigger 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.250
 The more air I public in the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.040
 diverse people of the group more 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.890
 they share more they reveal themselves to others 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.580
 etcetera and the less air I private 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:05.250
 that group works much better 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.950
 so chefs and cooks here you have 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.660
 a group dynamics I want that very 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.030
 interesting I forgot to say that 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.000
 logically the group wins within the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.550
 two that manages to guess more qualities and 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.560
 more and more skills or talents 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.670
 specials from the other group and then at 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.830
 final those that have not been eliminated 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.140
 Well, they rebel and in that way 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.120
 Well, we're all left with our 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.550
 our special skill chefs and 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.030
 cooks a pleasure as always and that 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.430
 this dynamic of today will serve you to 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.790
 cooking great learnings until the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.790
 next
