00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
I remember this machine activates the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.400 
I remember this machine activates the
parts<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.390> our<00:02:44.510> brain<00:02:44.599> with<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.900> marker<00:02:45.200> codes

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
parts of our brain with the marker codes

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.890 
parts of our brain with the marker codes
restored<00:02:46.239> how<00:02:47.239> does<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.480> threaten<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
restored how does that threaten the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.660 
restored how does that threaten the
marker<00:02:48.790> what<00:02:49.790> were<00:02:49.849> they<00:02:49.940> afraid<00:02:50.030> of

is stick a needle in Isaac's eye and you

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.380 
is stick a needle in Isaac's eye and you
have<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.050> do<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.380> when<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.890> light<00:03:30.070> is<00:03:30.250> blue

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.490 

problem<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.510> Isaac<00:03:34.930> was<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.110> little<00:03:35.320> nervous

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
problem is Isaac was a little nervous

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.650 
problem is Isaac was a little nervous
about<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.950> whole<00:03:36.010> procedure<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.239> he<00:03:37.420> keeps

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
about this whole procedure so he keeps

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.220 
about this whole procedure so he keeps
darting<00:03:38.260> around<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.670> squirming<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:40.420> think

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
darting around and squirming you think

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.449 
darting around and squirming you think
you<00:03:41.290> never<00:03:41.440> had<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.680> needle<00:03:42.010> stuck<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.340> your<00:03:42.400> eye

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.940 
you never had a needle stuck in your eye
before<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:43.540> what<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.080> do<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.320> get<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.830> as

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
before so what you do is just get it as

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.880 
before so what you do is just get it as
close<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.489> can<00:03:45.700> as<00:03:46.030> close<00:03:46.239> as<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.510> dare

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
close as you can as close as you dare

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.660 
close as you can as close as you dare
and<00:03:47.890> get<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.100> pretty<00:03:48.220> close<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:49.260> then<00:03:50.670> when

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
and get it pretty close and then when

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.820 
and get it pretty close and then when
the<00:03:51.760> turns<00:03:52.030> blue<00:03:52.270> do<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.050> final<00:03:53.290> push

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
the turns blue do a final push
