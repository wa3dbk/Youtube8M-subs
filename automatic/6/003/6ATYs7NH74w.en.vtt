Jeep at a normal ride height now what

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.940 
Jeep at a normal ride height now what
happens<00:00:41.010> when<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.250> lift<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:42.050> Jeep<00:00:43.079> well<00:00:43.290> come

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
happens when you lift a Jeep well come

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.360 
happens when you lift a Jeep well come
on<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.750> when<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.870> lift<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.260> Jeep<00:00:46.469> you're

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
on here when you lift a Jeep you're

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
on here when you lift a Jeep you're
raising<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.600> axle<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> axle

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
raising it up off the axle the axle

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.810 
raising it up off the axle the axle
still<00:00:49.710> staying<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> ground<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.670> what

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
still staying on the ground but what

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
still staying on the ground but what
happens<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> track<00:00:51.750> bar<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.230> still<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
happens is the track bar is still the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
happens is the track bar is still the
same<00:00:53.370> length<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.149> does<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
same length so what does that do that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
same length so what does that do that
draws<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.469> axle<00:00:56.210> over<00:00:57.210> usually<00:00:58.199> towards<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
draws the axle over usually towards the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.110 
draws the axle over usually towards the
driver<00:00:59.129> side<00:01:00.020> now<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.370> away<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.820> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
driver side now to get away from this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719 
driver side now to get away from this
what<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.989> buy<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.470> longer<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.280> an

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
what you can do is buy a longer or an

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.090 
what you can do is buy a longer or an
adjustable<00:01:06.210> track<00:01:06.570> bar<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.010> will

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
adjustable track bar and what that will

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.450 
adjustable track bar and what that will
do<00:01:08.510> is<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.210> longer<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
do is just make this longer and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
do is just make this longer and
therefore<00:01:14.460> bring<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.450> axle<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.049> over<00:01:16.470> here

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
therefore bring your axle back over here

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
therefore bring your axle back over here
where<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> needs<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.409> jeeps

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
where it needs to be now on jeeps

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.280 
where it needs to be now on jeeps
usually<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.080> get

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
usually that's about them when you get

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.859 
usually that's about them when you get
upwards<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.430> three<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:23.939> four<00:01:24.180> inches<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.720> need

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
upwards of three or four inches you need

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
upwards of three or four inches you need
to<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> longer<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.490> adjustable<00:01:27.060> track

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
to get a longer or an adjustable track

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
to get a longer or an adjustable track
bar<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:29.119> when<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> usually<00:01:31.229> you're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
bar so when you do that usually you're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.569 
bar so when you do that usually you're
going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> buy<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.369> aftermarket<00:01:32.880> track<00:01:33.329> bar

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
going to buy an aftermarket track bar

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.830 
going to buy an aftermarket track bar
unless<00:01:35.579> you're<00:01:35.759> doing<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.000> junkyard<00:01:36.270> build<00:01:36.689> but

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
unless you're doing a junkyard build but

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
unless you're doing a junkyard build but
an<00:01:37.020> aftermarket<00:01:37.860> track<00:01:38.220> bar<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
an aftermarket track bar is going to be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
an aftermarket track bar is going to be
heavier<00:01:39.210> duty<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.770> longer

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
heavier duty and it's going to be longer

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
heavier duty and it's going to be longer
and<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.820> adjustable<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and it's going to be adjustable so you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.499 
and it's going to be adjustable so you
get<00:01:42.840> more<00:01:43.619> than<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.159> benefit<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> in
