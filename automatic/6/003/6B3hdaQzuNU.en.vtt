character<00:03:58.799> from<00:03:59.100> scratch<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:02.250> I'd<00:04:02.459> come<00:04:02.700> in

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
character from scratch and I'd come in

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.380 
character from scratch and I'd come in
and<00:04:03.209> draw<00:04:03.420> maybe<00:04:04.459> bit<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> definition<00:04:06.180> here<00:04:06.209> I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
and draw maybe bit a definition here I

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.640 
and draw maybe bit a definition here I
might<00:04:06.570> be<00:04:06.690> going<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.930> little<00:04:07.019> overboard<00:04:07.350> here

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650
