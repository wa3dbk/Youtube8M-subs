electric this unit on the end as you can
see<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.680> small<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.579> point<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
see is really small it is for point of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
see is really small it is for point of
use<00:00:39.120> heat<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.379> used<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.710> an<00:00:40.829> entire

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
use heat it can be used for an entire

house but the incoming water temperature

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.389 
house but the incoming water temperature
has<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.989> high<00:00:43.200> enough<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> work

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
has to be high enough for it to work

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
has to be high enough for it to work
properly<00:00:44.899> typically<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> more

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
properly typically this would be more

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
properly typically this would be more

it<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.290> simple<00:01:40.470> installation

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
it would be a pretty simple installation

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
it would be a pretty simple installation
basically<00:01:42.450> tank<00:01:43.110> water<00:01:43.380> heater<00:01:43.649> already<00:01:44.130> has

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
basically tank water heater already has
