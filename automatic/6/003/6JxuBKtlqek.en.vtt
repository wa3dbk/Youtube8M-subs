00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I first started this project with my

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
I first started this project with my
designer<00:00:48.690> engineer<00:00:49.850> we<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.089> to<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.600> very

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
designer engineer we want to make a very

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.719 
designer engineer we want to make a very
powerful<00:00:52.620> imaging<00:00:53.309> device<00:00:54.079> very<00:00:55.079> powerful

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
powerful imaging device very powerful

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.200 
powerful imaging device very powerful
but<00:00:56.729> not<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> monster<00:00:58.609> we<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but not a monster we want to have a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
but not a monster we want to have a
powerful<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.320> powerful<00:01:01.350> yet<00:01:02.250> elegant<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
powerful so powerful yet elegant and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
powerful so powerful yet elegant and
slender<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> outside

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
slender from the outside

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.719 
slender from the outside
something<00:01:06.030> magical<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.830> had<00:01:08.039> many<00:01:08.430> many

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
something magical so we had many many

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.859 
something magical so we had many many
brainstorming<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.689> had<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> lot<00:01:10.800> of<00:01:11.009> sketches

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
brainstorming and had a lot of sketches

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.590 
brainstorming and had a lot of sketches
drawn<00:01:12.869> together<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.830> mock-up<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
drawn together with mock-up this is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.980 
drawn together with mock-up this is
something<00:01:15.929> that<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.380> early<00:01:16.649> pencil<00:01:17.340> sketch

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
something that very early pencil sketch

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.950 
something that very early pencil sketch
and<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> something<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:19.920> early<00:01:20.960> block

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and this is something very early block

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.700 
and this is something very early block

nothing<00:01:23.310> fancy<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.330> first<00:01:24.600> mock-up

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
nothing fancy but the very first mock-up

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
nothing fancy but the very first mock-up
we<00:01:27.390> felt<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.020> most<00:01:28.259> comfortable<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
we felt this is most comfortable that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.120 
we felt this is most comfortable that
lays<00:01:29.429> in<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.759> hand<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.590> when<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> compare

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
lays in your hand and when you compare

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.120 
lays in your hand and when you compare
with<00:01:32.340> an<00:01:32.490> actual<00:01:32.909> product<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.950> much

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
with an actual product it's not so much

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
with an actual product it's not so much
of<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.429> difference<00:01:35.600> from<00:01:36.600> our<00:01:36.810> very

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
of a difference from our very

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
of a difference from our very
aspirational<00:01:37.500> walk<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> actual

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
aspirational walk up to the actual

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.289 
aspirational walk up to the actual
product<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.789> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
product but then we want to have

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.679 
product but then we want to have
something<00:01:42.569> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.560> more<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.420> magical<00:01:45.420> spice

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
something a little more a magical spice

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
something a little more a magical spice
and<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.579> when<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.329> designer<00:01:49.280> met<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and that was when my designer met this

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.319 
and that was when my designer met this
folder<00:01:52.280> when<00:01:53.280> he<00:01:53.490> took<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.770> bling<00:01:56.179> he<00:01:57.179> got

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
folder when he took it out bling he got

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.169 
folder when he took it out bling he got
this<00:01:57.450> idea<00:01:58.189> why<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.369> playing<00:01:59.579> around<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
this idea why not playing around this is

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.209 
this idea why not playing around this is
reflection<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> side<00:02:01.350> David<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.009> bit

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
reflection on the side David little bit

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.319 
reflection on the side David little bit
magical<00:02:02.939> Ness

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
magical Ness

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.749 
magical Ness
so<00:02:04.109> if<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.289> actually<00:02:04.409> look<00:02:04.679> into<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> current

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so if you actually look into the current

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.380 
so if you actually look into the current
vivaz<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.679> here<00:02:08.009> he<00:02:08.789> has<00:02:09.000> applied<00:02:09.269> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
vivaz you can see here he has applied a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.430 
vivaz you can see here he has applied a
similar<00:02:10.070> magic<00:02:11.070> where<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.540> surface<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.109> a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
similar magic where the surface is a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.400 
similar magic where the surface is a
little<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.799> round<00:02:14.720> which<00:02:15.720> gives<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.170> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
little bit round which gives you this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.180 
little bit round which gives you this
magical<00:02:16.980> reflection<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:19.320> when<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.650> had<00:02:19.920> this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
magical reflection but when we had this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.259 
magical reflection but when we had this
round<00:02:20.549> surface<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.870> met<00:02:22.079> this<00:02:22.230> challenge

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
round surface we met this challenge

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.150 
round surface we met this challenge
some<00:02:24.269> people<00:02:24.630> wants<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.019> use<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.470> self-timer

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
some people wants to use a self-timer

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.020 
some people wants to use a self-timer
mode<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.760> being<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.780> very<00:02:28.100> imaging<00:02:29.100> product

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
mode and being a very imaging product

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.390 
mode and being a very imaging product
that<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.049> very<00:02:31.290> basic<00:02:31.530> use<00:02:31.829> case<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.190> could

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
that was a very basic use case I could

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.539 
that was a very basic use case I could
not<00:02:32.579> give<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:34.440> had<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> little<00:02:34.799> bit<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.190> lot

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
not give up so we had a little bit a lot
