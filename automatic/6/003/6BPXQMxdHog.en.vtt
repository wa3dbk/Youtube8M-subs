00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to make it so it doesn't wiggle back and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.080 
to make it so it doesn't wiggle back and
forth<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.250> makes<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> more<00:00:51.079> dot<00:00:53.090> what

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
forth and it just makes it more dot what

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.920 
forth and it just makes it more dot what
you're<00:00:54.180> gonna<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.690> put<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
formula allen key on that side the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.729 
formula allen key on that side the
socket<00:00:58.680> wrench<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.160> side<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.739> start
