00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
some mark on the yoke here this is the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.550 
some mark on the yoke here this is the
original<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> where<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> police

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
will be ending up - and this is where

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.600 
will be ending up - and this is where
the<00:01:25.500> full<00:01:25.740> contact<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> splines<00:01:28.770> here

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the full contact of the the splines here

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
the full contact of the the splines here
so<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:33.170> ok<00:01:35.869> ok<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.930> got

so what you get here is ok ok you got
full<00:01:37.470> contact<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> got<00:01:39.750> an<00:01:39.990> inch<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
full contact here so you got an inch and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.880 
full contact here so you got an inch and
a<00:01:41.579> quarter<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.659> time<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.590> makes

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
a quarter from the time that it makes

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.940 
a quarter from the time that it makes
full<00:01:44.070> contact<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> where<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.990> yoke<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.590> end

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
full contact to where the yoke would end

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.230 
full contact to where the yoke would end
up<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.390> police<00:01:48.720> tail<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:51.000> would

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
up with the police tail so the it would

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
up with the police tail so the it would
pretty<00:01:51.600> much<00:01:51.689> look<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> get

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pretty much look like this so you get

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429 
pretty much look like this so you get
only<00:01:53.610> an<00:01:53.880> inch<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> quarter<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.810> contact

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
only an inch and a quarter of contact

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.389 
only an inch and a quarter of contact
which<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.430> not<00:01:56.850> ideal<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:58.100> what<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> want

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
which is not ideal at all what you want

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.160 
which is not ideal at all what you want
to<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:01.640> civilian<00:02:02.640> yoke<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to do is you get that civilian yoke you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.160 
to do is you get that civilian yoke you
put<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> aluminum<00:02:05.670> driveshaft<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
put it on the aluminum driveshaft and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.249 
put it on the aluminum driveshaft and
then<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.580> full<00:02:09.090> contact<00:02:09.869> all<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
then you will have full contact all the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.760 
then you will have full contact all the
way

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
way

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.990 
way
