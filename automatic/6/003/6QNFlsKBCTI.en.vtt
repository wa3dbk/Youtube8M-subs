when<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.930> great<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.150> cabbage<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.530> use<00:03:02.530> this

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
when I great the cabbage I use this

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.720 
when I great the cabbage I use this
blade<00:03:03.129> here<00:03:03.579> it's<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:05.019> long<00:03:05.730> serve

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
blade here it's the the long serve

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.449 
blade here it's the the long serve
slicing<00:03:07.329> blade<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.409> going<00:03:08.980> against

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
slicing blade because it's going against

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.119 
slicing blade because it's going against
the<00:03:09.579> grain<00:03:09.609> of<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.000> cabbage<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.109> it<00:03:11.920> gets

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
the grain of the cabbage and so it gets

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.960 
the grain of the cabbage and so it gets
graded<00:03:12.670> into<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.329> little<00:03:13.540> shreds<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.790> now

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
graded into like little shreds so now

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.339 
graded into like little shreds so now
I'm<00:03:16.269> going<00:03:16.359> to<00:03:16.480> actually<00:03:16.629> put<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.349> in<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.590> bowl
