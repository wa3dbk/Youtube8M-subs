good and wide here so I can clip it on

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.900 
good and wide here so I can clip it on
the<00:00:25.610> frame<00:00:26.000> I<00:00:26.439> can<00:00:27.439> adjust<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:27.950> to<00:00:27.980> blow<00:00:28.309> in<00:00:28.520> the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
going to use it to raise the temperature

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.510 
going to use it to raise the temperature
here<00:00:41.420> if<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.260> was<00:00:42.440> cooking<00:00:42.830> on<00:00:42.950> this<00:00:43.160> thing<00:00:43.370> at

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
here if I was cooking on this thing at

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.610 
here if I was cooking on this thing at
250<00:00:44.300> degrees<00:00:44.330> they<00:00:44.810> in<00:00:44.990> tucking<00:00:45.440> some

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
250 degrees they in tucking some

temperature<00:00:47.420> they<00:00:48.140> want<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.410> raise<00:00:48.560> the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
temperature they want to raise the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.650 
temperature they want to raise the
temperature<00:00:48.950> quick<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:50.030> I<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:50.420> sear

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
temperature quick so that I can sear

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.410 
temperature quick so that I can sear
some<00:00:50.870> steaks<00:00:51.260> or<00:00:51.950> maybe<00:00:52.340> cook<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.640> pizza<00:00:52.940> I

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
some steaks or maybe cook a pizza I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.150 
some steaks or maybe cook a pizza I
don't<00:00:53.870> want<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.320> wait<00:00:54.530> for<00:00:54.800> half<00:00:54.980> an

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
don't want to have to wait for half an

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.479 
don't want to have to wait for half an
hour

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
hour

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.020 
hour
football<00:00:56.000> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
football and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.930 
football and
and<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.780> guess<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.470> when<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.250> cookers

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and then guess when when the cookers

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.940 
and then guess when when the cookers
didn't<00:01:00.210> come<00:01:00.330> up<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.570> temperature<00:01:00.770> using<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
didn't come up to temperature using the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.790 
didn't come up to temperature using the
BBQ<00:01:02.430> dragon<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.540> a<00:01:03.589> turbocharger<00:01:04.589> or

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
BBQ dragon here like a turbocharger or

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.760 
BBQ dragon here like a turbocharger or
supercharger<00:01:05.360> for<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> grill<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
supercharger for the grill I can do that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.300 
supercharger for the grill I can do that
really<00:01:08.130> fast<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.330> could<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.630> use<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.890> BBQ

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
really fast you could also use the BBQ

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.460 
really fast you could also use the BBQ
dragon<00:01:11.370> like<00:01:11.910> this<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.570> help<00:01:12.690> start<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> grill

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
dragon like this to help start the grill

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.040 
dragon like this to help start the grill
sometimes<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.520> hard<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.510> air<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
sometimes it's hard to get the air and

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.140 
sometimes it's hard to get the air and
everything<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.619> low<00:01:16.920> where<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> coals<00:01:17.880> are

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
everything down low where the coals are

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.930 
everything down low where the coals are
here<00:01:18.770> we're<00:01:19.770> rolling<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.190> here<00:01:20.400> past<00:01:20.640> 500

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
here we're rolling up here past 500

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.010 
here we're rolling up here past 500
degrees<00:01:21.660> in<00:01:22.320> very<00:01:22.979> short<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.720> when<00:01:24.720> any<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
degrees in very short time when any of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.109 
degrees in very short time when any of
it<00:01:25.170> using<00:01:25.410> a<00:01:25.860> BBQ<00:01:26.520> dragon<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it using a BBQ dragon in this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.270 
it using a BBQ dragon in this
configuration<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> blow<00:01:28.860> air<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.190> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
configuration we can blow air in the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.700 
configuration we can blow air in the
bottom<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.030> will<00:01:30.180> help<00:01:30.390> ignite<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
bottom and that will help ignite the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
bottom and that will help ignite the
coal<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.729> other<00:01:32.880> nice<00:01:33.090> thing<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
coal the other nice thing is this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
coal the other nice thing is this
variable<00:01:33.990> speed<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.070> we're<00:01:35.250> using<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
variable speed so when we're using it to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
variable speed so when we're using it to
start<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> grill<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.960> may<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.590> on

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
start the grill we may not want it on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
start the grill we may not want it on
super<00:01:38.190> high<00:01:38.220> speed<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.850> may<00:01:38.970> want<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.330> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
super high speed we may want to use it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660 
super high speed we may want to use it
on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.660> lower<00:01:39.840> speed<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.550> we<00:01:41.580> are

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
on the lower speed so now here we are

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.870 
on the lower speed so now here we are
we're<00:01:42.420> coming<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.619> minute<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.550> minute<00:01:44.580> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
we're coming up on a minute a minute and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.469 
we're coming up on a minute a minute and
a<00:01:45.000> half

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a half

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.359 
a half
we're<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.899> six<00:01:46.200> hundred<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> fifty<00:01:46.830> degrees

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
we're at six hundred and fifty degrees

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.940 
we're at six hundred and fifty degrees
we<00:01:47.940> raise<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> temperature<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> full<00:01:49.170> 400

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
we raise the temperature a full 400
