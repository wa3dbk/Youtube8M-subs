00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.390
 so friends the second decade of October 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.390
 fishing forecast go 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.100
 hi friends anglers and just lovers 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.870
 fishing 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.490
 let's see what they promise us 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.620
 nature poklevok mid-October 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.410
 here's what they say autumn came into its 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.790
 full possession as sung in 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:07.700
 famous song about the Russians in the sky harness 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:10.040
 ships somehow so nature and environmental 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.120
 Entourage and fishing delight the eye and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.360
 and cause sincere admiration 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.000
 bright yellow carpets autumn leaves 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.660
 chants of birds fun bit on the forest 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.040
 of animals 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:28.160
 oh lepot what beauty but brings the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.190
 negative weather with her school winds and 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.430
 cold rains friends 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.950
 before 10 o'clock already hurry to go fishing 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 it makes no sense since the fish after the night 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.520
 the cold spends a long time in the afternoon and therefore 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.190
 morning bite is almost absent 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.899
 except that a predator can peck off a boat 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.780
 This is not always and so friends let's 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.660
 let's see in detail what the clam promises us 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.149
 in this period compared to the first 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.429
 ten days of October, biting should 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.000
 to improve 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.890
 This is due to both the phases of the moon and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.380
 pressure stabilization 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.550
 the best time will be a lot from 9am and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.790
 until 5 pm 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.080
 night bite virtually absent and not 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.550
 brings comfort 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.920
 because of the cold weather and so peaceful fish 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.430
 more or less active will be caught white 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.000
 fish but compared to spring summer 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.850
 Bigger bites are likely 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.450
 created and crucian on animal bait and 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.840
 live bait 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 the best thing is to peck on the lakes and on 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.819
 rivers the water is very clean and fish carefully 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.480
 you need ultra thin tackle and small 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.209
 hooks in general cliff fish not stable 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.690
 start to pile up in winter hyan 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.270
 and knowing these places you can hope for 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.810
 good result 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:02.310
 the best numbers for cool are from 10 to 13 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.830
 and October 17th to 19th with good 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.890
 sunny weather bait 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.000
 This worms and animals nozzles from prikorma 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.370
 the best feed and cereal 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 aromatization tends to zero so 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.750
 move on to predatory fish 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.790
 predator pecks well above average 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.340
 there comes a time when the value of gear 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.519
 matters don't be afraid to bet 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.670
 Major tackle and pond with light and 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.730
 will thank your endeavors comes 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 trophy fishing time friends best 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.609
 the result will bring fishing with 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.659
 boats are places of predator concentration in 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.200
 wintering pits 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:48.379
 where peaceful fish is concentrated 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.290
 it is there that the words predator will live 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.989
 pike perch pike perch and likely bite 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.480
 large roach 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.349
 as always favorites jack lures and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.920
 drop shot 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.639
 i.e. the diverter lead is also excellent 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.889
 He proved itself to catch live bait 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.420
 Rivers will work and fishing friends 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:14.049
 more active and will be on lakes and ponds 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.380
 tackle you need to put a gentle and thin 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:21.919
 still friends do not forget to dress warmer 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.550
 hat and gloves will not be superfluous and so 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.940
 friends 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.400
 my recommendation for this period is catch 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.690
 active predator and white fish on 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.599
 my float is better on lakes and ponds 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.080
 tackle ultra thin period fishing with 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:42.289
 nine in the morning till five in the evening shows mercy 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.050
 the latest from spinner millet and autumn 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.979
 landscapes because everything that remains with us 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.169
 memory is emotions and emotions from fishing 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.190
 twins 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:58.610
 let you be your trophy friends that's all 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.820
 all no tail no scales always your most 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.820
 before
