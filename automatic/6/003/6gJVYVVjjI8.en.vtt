00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.450
 People are concerned about the tropical thing 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.250
 point system henning shows us how it is 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 So go watch you the time you need 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.950
 say something for the land i said you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.269
 doing 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 I do not know in what mood 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.830
 that's down to the now 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.250
 or deeper 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.250
 OK 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 small tuner there is to show you 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.430
 what kind of sound we are actually hearing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.470
 now live up to date and now 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.309
 we bring the whole time the normal 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.309
 mood back 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.450
 I have to say that it is not 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.940
 the most accurate mode is the man 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 reveal can adjust at the oven 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.440
 but I find that so I'm listening 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.260
 no difference to my others 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.820
 guitars if I agree with the normal ones 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.010
 we say now what you can now 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.840
 is again an open atmosphere 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:59.520
 of course, now try to know where on 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 which of these preset places which 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:14.910
 mood is stored in front of you 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:16.170
 read what is very precise now 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.430
 take the pages one by one you can 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.530
 also all six sides at the same time 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.530
 cautioned by there is not so good 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.300
 and you are 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.770
 be before 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.620
 Well , I think so too
