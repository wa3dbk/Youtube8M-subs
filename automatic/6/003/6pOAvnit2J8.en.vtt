 looking to capitalize on the popularity of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.660

 by the walking dead 'what the 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.040
 followers of this universe can

 they travel the country trying 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.520
 survive and gather supplies start 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.079
 escaping the walkers or walkers and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.180
 they realize that it is easier to spend 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.100
 stealthily confront the face to 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.510
 good face what's left of it 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.489
 they also discover that the ammunition 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.230
 for firearms are scarce and that 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.000
 many times they will prefer to attack the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.710
 zombies with a sudden impact by the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.510
 back or even fight hand-to-hand 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.310
 because if others listen to the pllamor 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.410
 will be surrounded in a few seconds and 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.940
 will end up being the physics scene in 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.470
 general is cared for example if 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.120
 throw a gas tank up a hill 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.610
 will roll down but in others 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.600
 Sometimes there are certain inconsistencies 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.040
 moments in which a light source 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.689
 cast shadows of the dead 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.759
 living 'but when you pass in 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.200
 front our character has no shadow 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.360
 the guns are shotguns pistols 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.159
 grenades and whatever they find to their 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.899
 step on the other hand gasoline is 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.789
 important serves to move us from 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.710
 location in location having to 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.260
 decide what kind of road road 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.210
 fast or streets unfortunately the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.770
 experience is repetitive and there are graphics 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.390
 that leave much to be desired 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.880
 game qualification about to kiss 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.880
 walking dead being male in synths of 6 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 until big car 5 is going to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.400
 forget with this formidable delivery of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.619
 police action in an open environment 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.200
 clear more friendly and less violent 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.580
 precisely lego city imagine a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 mix of new york or miami 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.509
 completely built of the pieces 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 friendly and inhabited by characters 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.530
 yellow you are 6 mccain and have 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.479
 returned after two years of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 absence because the criminal wax freak to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 who previously imprisoned has escaped from 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 prison with his escape has been unleashed the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.340
 crime everywhere to the car of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.750
 the mayor left on partitions 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 they will have to show off their 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 abilities as an undercover agent and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.630
 take advantage of different costumes or costumes 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.280
 that give them specific skills when 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.080
 pass a chapter opens the free mode 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.239
 to achieve something that they could not 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.190
 previously some will miss the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.840
 cooperative game of previous titles 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.850
 of lego but the game mode is better 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 alone on the other hand there are more than 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.989
 100 vehicles from motorcycles and cars to 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.730
 fire trucks and trailers every time 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.380
 that receive an impact disarm a 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.630
 little and can even jump in 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.340
 movement from one car to another one aspect 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.410
 fundamental of the game experience 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480
 is a communicator that they receive which is 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.400
 just like the gamepad the control 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.170
 willy touchscreen also 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.300
 to serve them as a locator 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.430
 the map is a useful tool like 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.410
 detective to analyze the environments and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.450
 find clues or hidden criminals 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.400
 so go after mobsters or clowns 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.470
 Asaltabancos the sense of humor is 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 everywhere and do not believe that by being 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.880
 of the ego is for children on the contrary the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 game is fun for all audiences with 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.150
 multiple cultural references 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.280
 modern and teasing the clichÃ©s of the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.530
 police stories the qualification of 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.850
 play tv point for cooking the cover 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.850
 is 9.2 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.710
 It has been proven that to make a game 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.240
 fun you do not need millions of 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.190
 budget dollars and graphs 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.470
 Photorealistic even with a good idea 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.360
 well executed just that is one air 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.670
 2 a platform title in which 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.920
 they must travel good to jump synchronize 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.230
 the turn of a hoop with the lever to plan 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.480
 kick crouch use trampolines in order 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.590
 take one way or another collecting the gold 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.900
 that they find in their path 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.880
 it sounds simple and in theory it is but 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.290
 everything happens extremely fast so 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.000
 it requires quite a bit of dexterity and 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.230
 coordination the game poses a 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.730
 story initially in which the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.590
 video commander and his classmates 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.600
 they chase an evil force until the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.070
 Hyper sphere but ends up transported to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.960
 another dimension which you will look for 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.790
 escape the truth does not make much sense 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.440
 the plot but it 's a good excuse for 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.390
 listen to the narration of charles martin 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.160
 who also makes the voice of mario the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.660
 levels are very well designed and at 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.880
 end of each one we are shown the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.560
 obtained score which we can even 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.360
 compare on the online boards to 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.370
 finish each section will face a 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.440
 level boss also making use of 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.240
 the skills obtained and the best of 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.430
 everything is that the experience is rhythmic and 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.410
 musical in short is more than recommended 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.480
 the game and can have it quickly 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.480
 since it is a downloadable delivery 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.340
 game rating
