00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.760
 hello everyone on meshuggah and today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 we look at what Soviet has become 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 class but these are 1c now the weight of the fifth 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 level we got naturally to the westfield 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.349
 I fight in the top well, the first fight on the technique 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.230
 usually in the top yes this is my first fight on 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:22.650
 kvass let's start with guns is 85 millimeters 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.859
 from 31 to all tth almost complete 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.009
 analogue square-1 avs who f30 we in the head 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.829
 120 to 119 breakdown 160 damage 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.309
 subcaliber 159 breakdown 160 damage and 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:38.010
 landmine 43 breakdown 280 damage one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 breakdown millimeter worse than kv-1 yes it is 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.329
 not serious but mixing faster 2 and 5 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.539
 and plus we still have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 Well, the accuracy is about the same from the good 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.859
 we have a little bit better mobility 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.949
 than anyone 1 before that almost 14 horse 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:56.010
 forces per ton and a better overview of 340 meters 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.640
 E 310 E instead i.e. here can 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.249
 put optics rammer and ventilation 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.320
 or reinforced pickup drives and optics 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.840
 i put on my valve honestly 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 saying now not even remembered but in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 Overall we have a good dmp almost 2000 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.240
 recharge 45 is just enough 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.790
 comfortable look at the setup and see that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.160
 here are three enemy artillery they are all 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.780
 enough short-range action to give two 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.300
 Bishop they are generally on the floor card only 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.250
 throws even less and so i'm here 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.410
 seriously fearing art fast-fire 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.060
 art is pretty accurate and my tank 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.340
 can hurt because 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 booking here is no match for me 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 higher here just defended you 75 60 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.890
 60 years old type maximum 80 masked leg and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.410
 almost all the straight lines can do it yourself 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 see therefore it comes here very well 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.530
 but the roof is naturally there for 10 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 millimeters this is not at all serious apt-1 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.210
 drives right here in square 1 to pursue 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.370
 and I immediately leave from the position because 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.300
 what if apt-1 nobody will hold no 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.450
 will he be 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.280
 and play through the tower yes I am bad there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 punching plus me shit on top 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.570
 three artillery and so I am from there immediately 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.550
 I'm dumping to help ours in the city 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.910
 but unfortunately there is no help here either. 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.080
 can 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 you can see that standing with 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.340
 but it is difficult to shoot them as luck would have it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.220
 will constantly come in sniper 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.350
 mode to see where the opponents are but to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.510
 Unfortunately replays in replays are all 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.820
 a little buggy thanks 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.580
 so you have to endure such 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.280
 small jitter throws are not michigan and 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.710
 It's clear that the art for me was aiming for her. 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.450
 she is unlikely to lag behind me in the city 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.430
 break into two strands 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.160
 level five bad idea especially since 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.170
 there btr with great alpha so i 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.090
 I think to move back to that flank 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.580
 more that that apt-1 which i was afraid 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.820
 generally took and went back to the city this 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.740
 Generally some nonsense while shines bdr 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.350
 I thought small might work here. 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.970
 somewhere get him throw but 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.370
 I spot square-1 here and it's here 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.050
 just in the shot for me the most 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.940
 the joke is that I -1 can't see me 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.160
 I am here for these bushes from 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.440
 He and I quietly snapped find 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.440
 even in a fairly open area 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.070
 but now I just saw t1 heavy 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.260
 threw on the good that more serious than 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.090
 serious from not over and drove 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.100
 reverse now he just drove apparently 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.440
 crush the thing but he put on the rink and 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.300
 we calmly shoot here 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 your attention that I throw only on the go 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.560
 you can hear for whatever reason 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.720
 this stalingrad which is around me 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.480
 constantly breaking and what's the most 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.220
 interesting that the circle of information in this 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.860
 guns are quite small as well as 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.620
 on apt-1 this is a very good feature 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.200
 for the early Soviet guns, well, on the fifth 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.470
 the level of f30 is also very good 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.050
 famous very much like the fact that 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.519
 the circle is small and you don't feel 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.590
 what's on the car information two and nine 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.220
 almost the same as the third on the very 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.680
 deed and inflicting the eighth proper and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.560
 destroyed here t1 here i am very 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.360
 inattentively tried to leave was afraid 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.150
 thing but that probably does not throw at me 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.739
 already left somewhere I find here 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.530
 a subscriber who knew me in battle and to 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.450
 Sorry I burn it 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.730
 he got unfortunately in the opposite 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.630
 the team they allied pieces agry on 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.370
 I understandably am somewhere 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.989
 I do not break through it but by the way 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.430
 look quite yourself just punches 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.980
 even though I put it to him 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.750
 board at a good angle and still me 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.480
 punches and he punches me in 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.940
 the board exactly there he aimed 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.130
 the board is very weak with this car just 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.600
 only 60 millimeters without any 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.970
 any rational angles 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.830
 plus more of course caterpillars but you could 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.320
 see what the gods sold me 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.210
 fixed without problems because me and 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.670
 three arta do not pull all without fabric 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.800
 rapid-fire and here he was already throwing 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.050
 priests lit the scourge and the rest are no longer 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.970
 guessed that i 'm not standing in the same place 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.950
 thrown there 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.960
 finds arthur here i lit up i 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.880
 I know for sure despite the fact that I have 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.070
 There's even no light bulbs to 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.610
 it was high quality and so I am leaving 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.350
 back safe get close to the field while you 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.540
 you're behind the light is not very good 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.520
 Day, in principle, I could throw Yes 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.370
 while I was there, I skated my son back 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.770
 threw on thanks to the genus here 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.900
 bottom of us so that the enemy me in advance 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.820
 didn't even see the camera 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.950
 see where bishop is looking and 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.530
 do you understand that the guy is not looking at me 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.590
 it means the time of the great ram and 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.590
 terrible throw from the guard but in full 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.410
 go and yes yes I pour the boy the rest of hepe 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.360
 but it is an indescribable feeling to 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.130
 Unfortunately in 2 he does not go right there 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.440
 they say well, I understand his business 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.900
 fellow I crushed throw again on 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.110
 go and get it to add to 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.250
 Unfortunately, it remains to me 11 m because the gun from 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.650
 escapes me 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.800
 but I do not get quietly by the way if 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.610
 probably got hit and most likely 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.250
 would take a new one 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.380
 grandfather entered into a rage and is already going for 3 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.960
 british artillery boon quietly 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.540
 punished and then I'm trying to call in from behind 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.490
 to hiv gannon it did not expect but to 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.260
 Sorry , I haven't got an alpha 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.510
 and therefore have to do another 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.450
 a shot here by the way an epic shot 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.000
 through the cannon and I think they will take it away 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.170
 No, no, I had a great time, but now 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.990
 let's see the result turned out that is and 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.240
 almost 2,000 damage to devote 11 medals 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.580
 spartan warrior main caliber and 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.409
 Naturally, my beloved paskuchchi 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.650
 Of course, the mark of class master 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:33.500
 pure 1185 experience and plank let's say 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.479
 so-so for level five so what 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.620
 tells us that tanchik is far away 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.099
 far from for 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.500
 plus it turned out to be fond of 36 thousand 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.539
 before without a premium account would be 22 well for 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.430
 quite ordinary for such 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.680
 results of the battle but also for the machine of the fifth 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.319
 level overall what are the impressions 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.900
 the car is much less armored than 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:56.090
 kv-1 in general about the reservation no speech 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.599
 there is mobility yes better review a little 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.030
 a little better but is it worth me 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.129
 it seems not and plus many more here 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.349
 put the blower q but the blow of a movie heavy 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.180
 I don't like tanks at all and I don't boat 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.940
 so it is up to you 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.250
 my opinion is apt-1s quite a good one 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.250
 tank of the fifth level, given that he has 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.770
 competitors are one another terrible but 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.139
 still overshadow apt-1 he doesn't 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.240
 It turns out unfortunately and I think that already 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.909
 it didn't work out many of you to his waist 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.520
 legs you understand that chip kv1 in good 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.990
 booking and excellent kvass guns 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.819
 Of course, he is a little bit better. 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.099
 mobility and quite a bit better 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:36.080
 see but it's not so weighty 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:39.229
 the benefits are still kv-1 armor 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.229
 even saves against tanks of level 7 auc 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:44.330
 how to dance sevens on this one 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.669
 I can't imagine myself 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.009
 the tower was stronger but the tower is uttermost 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:51.110
 holey cardboard so even from the tower 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:54.319
 enemies somehow tanchiki not breed 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.960
 get something you can not say about apt-1 whole 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:59.060
 the tank is quite self and playable fit but 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.120
 keep on postoyanke I would not have become 

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.650
 would roll on a square-1 still a square-1 van love
