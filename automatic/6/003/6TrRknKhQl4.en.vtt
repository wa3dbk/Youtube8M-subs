00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
to see how this works now let's say you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.730 
to see how this works now let's say you
have<00:02:42.740> an<00:02:43.040> adjustable<00:02:43.580> shelf<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
have an adjustable shelf like this and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.520 
have an adjustable shelf like this and
you<00:02:45.800> want<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.100> get<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.459> off<00:02:46.730> up<00:02:46.940> here

you want to get this off up here
you<00:02:48.530> know<00:02:48.620> once<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.980> gets<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.370> bad<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.000> would

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
you know once it gets this bad I would

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.540 
you know once it gets this bad I would
not<00:02:50.360> recommend<00:02:50.660> trying<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.410> glue<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.920> clamp

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
not recommend trying to glue that clamp

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.120 
not recommend trying to glue that clamp
it<00:02:52.790> chances<00:02:53.239> are<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.989> may<00:02:54.320> hold<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.950> few

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
it chances are it may hold for a few

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.530 
it chances are it may hold for a few
months<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.580> then<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.209> going<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.420> start

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
months and then it's going to start

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.949 
months and then it's going to start
lifting<00:02:56.959> again<00:02:57.580> okay<00:02:58.580> what<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:59.300> might<00:02:59.540> think

let's look I'm only going to get so much

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.330 
let's look I'm only going to get so much
all<00:04:06.590> right<00:04:07.930> if<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.200> can<00:04:09.320> imagine<00:04:09.620> if<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.130> is

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
all right if you can imagine if this is

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.130 
all right if you can imagine if this is
underneath<00:04:10.820> your<00:04:10.880> upper<00:04:11.420> cabinet<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.079> your

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
underneath your upper cabinet in your

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.960 
underneath your upper cabinet in your
kitchen<00:04:12.590> you're<00:04:13.250> gonna<00:04:13.370> be<00:04:13.519> sitting<00:04:13.820> there

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
kitchen you're gonna be sitting there

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.490 
kitchen you're gonna be sitting there
chipping<00:04:14.540> away<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:15.140> then<00:04:15.260> you're<00:04:15.320> going<00:04:15.440> to

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
chipping away and then you're going to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.039 
chipping away and then you're going to
mark<00:04:15.829> up<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.070> surface<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:17.750> know<00:04:17.900> and

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
mark up the surface you know and

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.559 
mark up the surface you know and
it's<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:20.949> not<00:04:21.160> going<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.430> work<00:04:21.669> very<00:04:21.699> well

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:22.569 
it's just not going to work very well

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:27.749 
it's just not going to work very well
you<00:04:22.720> see<00:04:22.900> what<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.080> mean<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:27.190> get<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.460> you're

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
you see what I mean you get it you're

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.249 
you see what I mean you get it you're
gonna<00:04:27.849> take<00:04:28.449> forever

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
gonna take forever

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.550 
gonna take forever
you<00:04:29.440> get<00:04:29.710> wide<00:04:29.979> you<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.849> get<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.380> chisel<00:04:32.380> on

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you get wide you can get a chisel on

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.430 
you get wide you can get a chisel on
there<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.190> carefully<00:04:34.120> do<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.930> but

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
there and carefully do that but

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.930 
there and carefully do that but
eventually<00:04:35.830> you're<00:04:36.130> going<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.280> start<00:04:36.550> marking

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
eventually you're going to start marking

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.700 
eventually you're going to start marking
up<00:04:37.060> this<00:04:37.210> edge<00:04:37.479> what<00:04:37.930> if<00:04:38.020> we<00:04:38.169> what<00:04:38.500> if<00:04:38.590> we're

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
up this edge what if we what if we're

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.680 
up this edge what if we what if we're
