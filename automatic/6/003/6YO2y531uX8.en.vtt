00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
packaging reminded me of something that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.280

it's kind of cool kind of retro um and I
also<00:03:10.430> use<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:11.000> twice<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.570> it's<00:03:11.660> actually<00:03:12.080> a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
also use this twice and it's actually a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.199 
also use this twice and it's actually a
little<00:03:12.260> bit<00:03:12.560> scary<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.160> use<00:03:13.550> but<00:03:13.850> once<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.120> get

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
little bit scary to use but once you get

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.190 
little bit scary to use but once you get
the<00:03:14.360> hang<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:17.150> works<00:03:17.600> out<00:03:17.810> okay<00:03:18.140> so

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the hang of it it works out okay so

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.160 
the hang of it it works out okay so
basically<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:19.570> haven't<00:03:20.570> used<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:20.870> my<00:03:20.990> lips

I've been using it on my cheeks and it
comes<00:03:23.510> out<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:24.050> put<00:03:24.800> just<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.100> little<00:03:25.130> bit
