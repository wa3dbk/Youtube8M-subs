ways I can do it manually by using my

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.740 
ways I can do it manually by using my
pitch<00:03:10.110> adjust<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.159> BPMS<00:03:11.790> match<00:03:12.120> both

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
pitch adjust so the BPMS match both

at<00:04:12.420> all<00:04:12.540> now<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.319> want<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.530> use<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.799> touch

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
at all now I want to use the touch

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.780 
at all now I want to use the touch
that's<00:04:14.730> gonna<00:04:14.880> enable<00:04:15.210> your<00:04:15.480> scratch<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> you

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
that's gonna enable your scratch so you

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.390 
that's gonna enable your scratch so you
can<00:04:17.970> scratch<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.510> track<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.350> when<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.709> tap

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
can scratch the track but when you tap

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.220 
can scratch the track but when you tap
the<00:04:20.430> top<00:04:20.790> it's<00:04:21.209> going<00:04:21.360> to<00:04:21.420> stutter<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.989> right

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
the top it's going to stutter you right

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.860 
the top it's going to stutter you right
to<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.500> cue<00:04:22.710> point<00:04:26.510> all<00:04:27.510> right<00:04:27.540> we<00:04:27.750> have<00:04:27.840> a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
to the cue point all right we have a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.650 
to the cue point all right we have a
3-band<00:04:28.440> EQ<00:04:28.890> on<00:04:28.920> each<00:04:29.310> channel<00:04:29.880> this<00:04:30.330> allows

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
3-band EQ on each channel this allows

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.570 
3-band EQ on each channel this allows
you<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.990> really<00:04:31.260> fine-tune<00:04:31.620> your<00:04:32.070> music<00:04:32.460> and

you to really fine-tune your music and
your<00:04:32.820> mix<00:04:33.060> depending<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.570> how<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.810> play<00:04:34.160> now

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
your mix depending on how you play now

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.880 
your mix depending on how you play now
taking<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.940> EQ<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.600> all<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.080> way<00:04:37.200> down<00:04:37.470> we'll

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
taking the EQ is all the way down we'll

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.950 
taking the EQ is all the way down we'll
give<00:04:38.040> you<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.190> complete<00:04:38.340> kill<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.360> your<00:04:39.750> low

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
give you a complete kill of your low

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.850 
give you a complete kill of your low
high<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.560> mids<00:04:40.830> as<00:04:41.010> well<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.780> using<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.650> loops

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
high and mids as well so using the loops

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.250 
high and mids as well so using the loops
couldn't<00:04:47.310> be<00:04:47.370> easier<00:04:47.730> all<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.300> have<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.720> do<00:04:48.900> is

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
couldn't be easier all you have to do is

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.990 
couldn't be easier all you have to do is
hit<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> loop<00:04:49.830> button<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.400> it's<00:04:50.790> going<00:04:50.940> to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
hit the loop button and it's going to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 
hit the loop button and it's going to
glute<00:04:51.330> or<00:04:51.660> whatever<00:04:52.020> predetermined<00:04:52.860> measure

disable it all you have to do is hit the
loop<00:04:57.150> again<00:04:57.450> now<00:04:58.380> when<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.680> hit<00:04:58.800> your<00:04:59.010> loop

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
loop again now when you hit your loop

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.100 
loop again now when you hit your loop
your<00:04:59.760> waveform<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.300> going<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.660> blue

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
your waveform is going to have a blue

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.500 
your waveform is going to have a blue
color<00:05:01.650> right<00:05:01.890> around<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.430> when<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.120> disable

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
color right around it when you disable

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.210 
color right around it when you disable
it<00:05:03.780> you're<00:05:04.170> still<00:05:04.470> going<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.710> see<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.950> little

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
it you're still going to see a little

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.710 
it you're still going to see a little
bit<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.700> so<00:05:06.150> whenever<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.540> hit<00:05:06.660> the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
bit of that so whenever you hit the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.900 
bit of that so whenever you hit the
really<00:05:07.050> button<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.890> know<00:05:08.010> exactly<00:05:08.520> where

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
really button you know exactly where

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.600 
really button you know exactly where
your<00:05:09.060> previous<00:05:09.540> loop<00:05:09.750> begins<00:05:10.020> or<00:05:10.530> ends<00:05:10.770> by

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
your previous loop begins or ends by

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.700 
your previous loop begins or ends by
using<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:12.000> divide<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.630> multiply<00:05:12.750> buttons<00:05:13.410> is

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
using the divide and multiply buttons is

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.470 
using the divide and multiply buttons is
going<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:13.950> allow<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.310> cut<00:05:15.060> your<00:05:15.180> loop<00:05:15.360> in

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
going to allow you to cut your loop in

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.500 
going to allow you to cut your loop in
half<00:05:15.720> or<00:05:16.290> double<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:20.120> all<00:05:21.120> right<00:05:21.210> you've<00:05:21.360> got

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
half or double it all right you've got

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.540 
half or double it all right you've got
four<00:05:21.840> awesome<00:05:22.169> effects<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.890> choose<00:05:22.950> from<00:05:23.400> that

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
four awesome effects to choose from that

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.300 
four awesome effects to choose from that
can<00:05:23.700> be<00:05:23.850> used<00:05:24.120> on<00:05:24.300> deck<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.870> or<00:05:25.140> deck<00:05:25.350> B<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:26.190> have

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
can be used on deck a or deck B you have

using the time rate knob on the front

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.510 
using the time rate knob on the front
we're<00:05:33.630> also<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.169> frequency<00:05:34.410> amount<00:05:35.040> which

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
we're also the frequency amount which

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.550 
we're also the frequency amount which
you<00:05:35.640> also<00:05:35.880> have<00:05:36.270> visual<00:05:36.750> representations

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
you also have visual representations

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.090 
you also have visual representations
numerically<00:05:38.340> directly<00:05:39.000> on<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.210> screen<00:05:40.100> so

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
that was the stanton SCS for DJ mix

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.900 
that was the stanton SCS for DJ mix
station<00:05:44.070> I'll<00:05:44.310> see<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.210> in<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.720> mix
