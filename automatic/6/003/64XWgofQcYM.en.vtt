 that filling xd I come to you today with a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.649
 creepy new pasta fresh from the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.319
 oven is about a guy who buys a 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.479
 platinum pokémon cartridge but that 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.390
 Blissful cartridge comes out with a defect 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.119
 I say defective defect what a bastard 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.050
 those flaws that you say what the fuck is 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.070
 this 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.550
 shit 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.800
 xp and in that aforementioned cartridge comes out 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.330
 a touch with very special and strong but 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.090
 it turns out to be the devil himself 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.980
 locked in the game is the pokemon 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.530
 eucaryotic but has a strange color 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.270
 black well, here is the creepy 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.390
 Today's pasta is titled the Aryan look 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.970
 black and I thank him it was only the 37 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.040
 for giving me the idea I hope this is 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.490
 one of the many ideas that you give me for 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.330
 increase my good channel achilles look 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.880
 to black because this has happened to me 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.750
 maybe I'll be cursed by some joke 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.750
 of destiny perhaps I will be chosen to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 go to hell I know it's a game but 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.980
 I felt it so real it was as if a 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.400
 strange feeling will pierce me all the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.640
 body 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.280
 an uncontrollable fear those fears that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.190
 they do not give you daily are those fears 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.440
 what do you feel when something is not right 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.120
 because I tell you all this chitchat is 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.220
 because I've come across the very same 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.950
 demon that has been locked in a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.560
 game that seems almost normal I mean 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.819
 to a platinum pokémon cartridge that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.129
 demon in quotes 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.379
 and it turned out to be a pokemon much coveted by 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.769
 me nothing more and nothing less than a place myself 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.349
 black I will never forget his features but 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.049
 I'm deviating from the topic better 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.999
 I will tell what happened my name is alexis 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.579
 and I will tell you how that place came 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:33.159
 black everything started when he left the 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.439
 I was heading to my house because 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.109
 I was tired from the day of studies 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.120
 of newspaper I wanted to get to play with my 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.129
 console sees that and they had told me that 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.290
 the pokémon game had arrived 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.939
 had separated two months ago was the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.280
 pokémon platinum 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.060
 without thinking I took the box where it came from and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.310
 I went up to my bedroom to play it in order 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.530
 everything started normal as I remembered 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.019
 because that game had finished me in 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.659
 the pc many times it was not strange 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.909
 but there was a saved game but 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.340
 well I got into that game and then 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.620
 I thought let's see how much your 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.079
 old owner I hope they are pokemon 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.900
 very strong or a simple fool who has a 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.730
 Fuck team and I was wrong only 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.519
 I had a pokemon and that pokemon was a 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.660
 place I went into their status was a 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.720
 place me black 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.710
 reds and a terrifying look when I saw 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.370
 his status I saw that he had everything in 666 and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.350
 it was level 666 too but that I know 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.140
 a pokémon only reaches level 100 that 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.260
 fucking happens will surely be a beggar 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.750
 I thought but I do not think because it's game 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.080
 of the original box had many theories 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.120
 but none successful finally continue my 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.120
 game and I saw that he had six medals of 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.010
 eight in itself not that it is to be chingón but 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.860
 there was something that I did not like and it gave me 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.050
 bad thorn would not let me catch pokemon 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.150
 much less have them for more than 5 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.610
 seconds to catch them and to finish 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.430
 the place I called hell in 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.730
 Spanish and the coach was called weak 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.490
 demon I was left with a face of what 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.580
 fucking with the life of this wey 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.220
 Maybe he was insane or what a fart 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.020
 continuing I could not catch a little 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.390
 because she said she has murdered your 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.820
 Pokemon will continue pokemon league up 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.100
 come with the champion of when 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.409
 I was told to go away stay away 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.419
 disgusting demon of evil that makes 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.529
 because you fill my life with horror 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.110
 happy 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.999
 get away the battle started but the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.339
 the champion's song was heard 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:40.119
 slowed down and only had one 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:45.009
 pokémon with a place I level 50 but 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:47.619
 I thought and easy with him but it was so 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.989
 I defeated and there was the cynthia spirit 

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:52.739
 thrown with blood his last words 

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:56.969
 before dying in quotation marks were you 

00:05:52.739 --> 00:06:00.360

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:02.309

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.939
 murdered my character too and the 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:10.019

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:21.029

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:26.699
 my console ds and I will never ever go back to 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.159

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.019
 locked in an asylum and sometimes 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.319
 I feel like fighting, I watch myself and he 

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:35.909
