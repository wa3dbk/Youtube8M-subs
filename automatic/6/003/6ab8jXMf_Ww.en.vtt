00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
this is the e prodigy BAMF and actually

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.179 
this is the e prodigy BAMF and actually
I<00:00:06.420> think<00:00:06.600> they<00:00:06.870> used<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.200> call<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.410> like<00:00:07.740> epic

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
I think they used to call it like epic

Andy prodigy is the name that they're
going<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.530> now<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.700> pretty<00:00:12.599> cool

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
going with now this is a pretty cool

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780 
going with now this is a pretty cool
bike<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:13.920> bit<00:00:14.130> smaller

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
bike because it's a little bit smaller

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.540 
bike because it's a little bit smaller
so<00:00:15.299> if<00:00:15.450> you're<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> short<00:00:16.139> rider<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.190> 15

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
so if you're a short rider it's a 15

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.160 
so if you're a short rider it's a 15
inch<00:00:17.760> frame<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.570> nice<00:00:18.750> step

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
inch frame and it's got this nice step

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.840 
inch frame and it's got this nice step
through<00:00:19.439> design<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.070> easily<00:00:20.400> get<00:00:20.820> on

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
through design so you can easily get on

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.359 
through design so you can easily get on
to<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> handlebars<00:00:23.130> very

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.189 
to it and just have the handlebars very
close<00:00:23.730> they're<00:00:24.029> also<00:00:24.180> adjustable<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> can

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
close they're also adjustable you can

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.800 
close they're also adjustable you can
see<00:00:25.529> right<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> kind<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
see right here this is the kind of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
see right here this is the kind of
adjustment<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.310> go<00:00:29.460> over<00:00:29.490> curbs<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
adjustment that if you go over curbs and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.460 
adjustment that if you go over curbs and
things<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.570> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> little<00:00:31.349> bit

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
things can kind of get a little bit

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.200 
things can kind of get a little bit
loose<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> sloppy<00:00:32.130> over<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.940> make<00:00:33.180> sure

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
loose and sloppy over time so make sure

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.510 
loose and sloppy over time so make sure
you<00:00:33.480> keep<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.719> tight<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:35.010> also<00:00:35.219> goes

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
you keep that tight and that also goes

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.450 
you keep that tight and that also goes
for<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> nice<00:00:36.059> basket<00:00:36.420> setup<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> rear<00:00:38.219> rack

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
for the nice basket setup and rear rack

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.000 
for the nice basket setup and rear rack
that<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> tighten<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:40.500> here

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that you can tighten right here

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
that you can tighten right here
overall<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.149> bike<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.510> only<00:00:42.660> about<00:00:42.899> 52

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
overall this bike is only about 52

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.220 
overall this bike is only about 52
pounds<00:00:43.680> which<00:00:44.100> isn't<00:00:44.399> too<00:00:44.730> bad<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.050> uses

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
pounds which isn't too bad and it uses

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.639 
pounds which isn't too bad and it uses
this<00:00:46.469> unique<00:00:46.829> mid<00:00:47.160> Drive<00:00:47.510> system<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this unique mid Drive system so what you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.729 
this unique mid Drive system so what you
get<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:52.110> low<00:00:52.289> center<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
get with this is a really low center of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.250 
get with this is a really low center of
gravity<00:00:53.360> balanced<00:00:54.360> right<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
gravity balanced right there in the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
gravity balanced right there in the
center<00:00:55.469> you'll<00:00:56.250> notice<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> battery<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
center you'll notice the battery is a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
center you'll notice the battery is a
little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.480> higher<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.350> towards<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> rear

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
little bit higher and towards the rear

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.010 
little bit higher and towards the rear
so<00:00:59.820> it's<00:00:59.940> nice<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so it's nice that they you know some of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.360 
so it's nice that they you know some of
the<00:01:01.079> weight<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> down<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.070> also

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the weight is down there you also

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.030 
the weight is down there you also
leverage<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.329> gears<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> rear<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
leverage the gears in in the rear and in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.859 
leverage the gears in in the rear and in
this<00:01:05.159> case<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.549> got<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> three-speed<00:01:06.360> Nexus

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this case it's got a three-speed Nexus

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.920 
this case it's got a three-speed Nexus
hub<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> shift<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.600> here

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hub that you can kind of shift up here

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
hub that you can kind of shift up here
using<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> grip<00:01:10.650> even<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.640> you're<00:01:11.760> standing

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
using the grip even if you're standing

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510 
using the grip even if you're standing
still<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.310> kind<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
still like we are now so it's kind of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
still like we are now so it's kind of
neat<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.060> works<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> chain

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
neat the way that works you the chain

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
neat the way that works you the chain
only<00:01:16.530> connects<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.610> cog<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.479> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
only connects on one cog back here it's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
only connects on one cog back here it's
not<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.020> slipping<00:01:19.259> around<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
not going to be slipping around and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.560 
not going to be slipping around and
that's<00:01:20.640> ideal<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.450> you're<00:01:21.689> using<00:01:22.310> again<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
that's ideal if you're using again a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.289 
that's ideal if you're using again a
center<00:01:24.570> Drive<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.460> 350

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
center Drive like this so that's a 350

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
center Drive like this so that's a 350
watt<00:01:27.330> motor<00:01:27.689> there<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.710> creates<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> little

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
watt motor there and it creates a little

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.310 
watt motor there and it creates a little
bit<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.460> noise<00:01:29.909> depending<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> gear

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
bit more noise depending on the gear

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
bit more noise depending on the gear
you're<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.850> either<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you're in back here it's either going to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
you're in back here it's either going to
climb<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:34.020> better<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.590> give<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
climb a little bit better or give you a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.700 
climb a little bit better or give you a
higher<00:01:35.280> top<00:01:35.549> speed<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> US

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
higher top speed and so this in the US

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
higher top speed and so this in the US
is<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:37.950> 20<00:01:38.430> mile<00:01:38.610> per<00:01:38.640> hour<00:01:38.880> top<00:01:39.180> speed<00:01:39.240> I'm

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
is about 20 mile per hour top speed I'm

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
is about 20 mile per hour top speed I'm
actually<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.500> Canada<00:01:40.710> checking<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.430> thing

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
actually in Canada checking this thing

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
actually just uses a cadence sensor

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.200 
actually just uses a cadence sensor
right<00:02:25.120> back<00:02:25.300> here<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:26.200> sense<00:02:26.500> motion<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.460> as

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
right back here to sense motion and as

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.640 
right back here to sense motion and as
soon<00:02:28.390> as<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.630> senses<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.740> kicks<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.340> and

basket that I took off for the ride test

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.790

know get bumped you know this is a step
through<00:03:32.530> design<00:03:32.830> it's<00:03:33.040> easier<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.520> mount<00:03:33.700> if

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
through design it's easier to mount if

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.550 
through design it's easier to mount if
you<00:03:34.360> were<00:03:34.480> swinging<00:03:34.870> your<00:03:34.990> leg<00:03:35.020> over<00:03:35.440> you

that light in the rear along with this
nice<00:03:52.030> one<00:03:52.300> right<00:03:52.720> here<00:03:52.960> this<00:03:53.080> kind<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.320> chrome

just<00:03:54.280> an<00:03:54.400> LED<00:03:54.850> set<00:03:55.180> up<00:03:55.330> hybrid<00:03:56.200> tires<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.850> I

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
just an LED set up hybrid tires so I

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.600 
just an LED set up hybrid tires so I
think<00:03:58.750> there's<00:03:59.380> like<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.710> artistic<00:04:00.280> appeal

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
think there's like this artistic appeal

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.720 
think there's like this artistic appeal

don't know if it speaks to me I get it
kind<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.780> cute<00:04:13.960> bike<00:04:14.170> right<00:04:14.590> so<00:04:15.630> sprung

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
kind of a cute bike right so sprung

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.900 
kind of a cute bike right so sprung
saddle<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.290> little<00:04:17.590> bit<00:04:17.920> larger<00:04:18.370> if<00:04:18.700> you're

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
saddle a little bit larger if you're

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.090 
saddle a little bit larger if you're
pedaling<00:04:19.330> for<00:04:19.600> long<00:04:19.930> distances<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.710> know

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
pedaling for long distances you know

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.320 
pedaling for long distances you know
your<00:04:21.250> legs<00:04:21.460> could<00:04:21.669> chafe<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:22.000> little<00:04:22.210> bit

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
your legs could chafe a little bit

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.450 
your legs could chafe a little bit
easier<00:04:22.630> on<00:04:22.660> this<00:04:22.900> because<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.290> is<00:04:23.440> wide<00:04:23.710> but

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
easier on this because it is wide but

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.560 
easier on this because it is wide but
it's<00:04:24.610> also<00:04:24.729> going<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.000> give<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.180> some<00:04:25.419> more

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
it's also going to give you some more

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.120 
it's also going to give you some more
comfort<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.080> support<00:04:26.350> so

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
comfort and support so

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.020 
comfort and support so
you<00:04:27.340> know<00:04:27.430> that's<00:04:27.580> one<00:04:27.730> of<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.880> trade-offs

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
you know that's one of the trade-offs

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.810 
you know that's one of the trade-offs
also<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.290> like<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.920> it's<00:04:30.040> got<00:04:30.100> sort<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.580> side

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
also I like that it's got sort of a side

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.930 
also I like that it's got sort of a side
kickstand<00:04:31.420> like<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.680> folds<00:04:33.130> up<00:04:33.280> much

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
kickstand like this that folds up much

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.450 
kickstand like this that folds up much
higher<00:04:34.140> which<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.170> ideal<00:04:35.590> these<00:04:35.950> wheels<00:04:36.190> are

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
higher which is ideal these wheels are

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.480 
higher which is ideal these wheels are
about<00:04:36.760> 26<00:04:37.450> inches<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:39.070> wheels<00:04:39.250> are<00:04:39.400> a

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
about 26 inches and so the wheels are a

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.590 
about 26 inches and so the wheels are a
little<00:04:39.580> bit<00:04:39.730> smaller<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.270> brings<00:04:40.480> the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
little bit smaller and that brings the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.330 
little bit smaller and that brings the
whole<00:04:40.870> frame<00:04:41.260> closer<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.860> ground<00:04:42.070> makes

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
whole frame closer to the ground makes

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.580 
whole frame closer to the ground makes
it<00:04:42.460> easier<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.880> mount<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:43.900> again<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.290> whole

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
it easier to mount so again the whole

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.670 
it easier to mount so again the whole
idea<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:44.980> making<00:04:45.310> this<00:04:45.610> approachable<00:04:46.680> it's

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
idea of making this approachable it's

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.410 
idea of making this approachable it's
got<00:04:47.890> your<00:04:48.010> rim<00:04:48.340> brakes<00:04:48.610> here<00:04:48.850> or<00:04:49.060> v<00:04:49.210> brakes

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
got your rim brakes here or v brakes

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.390 
got your rim brakes here or v brakes
front<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.780> rear<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.140> they<00:04:50.710> offer<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.220> know

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
front and rear and they offer you know

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.920 
front and rear and they offer you know
pretty<00:04:51.610> good<00:04:51.700> stopping<00:04:52.150> power<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.540> then

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
pretty good stopping power and then

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.960 
pretty good stopping power and then
these<00:04:53.080> folding<00:04:53.500> pedals<00:04:53.830> which<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.370> imagine

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
these folding pedals which I imagine

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.520 
these folding pedals which I imagine
they<00:04:55.060> use<00:04:55.240> just<00:04:55.510> because<00:04:55.660> they're<00:04:55.840> less

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
they use just because they're less

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.830 
they use just because they're less
expensive<00:04:57.120> there's<00:04:58.120> nothing<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.570> know<00:04:58.660> they

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
expensive there's nothing you know they

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.320 
expensive there's nothing you know they
it's<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.650> little<00:05:00.220> bit<00:05:00.340> rubberized<00:05:00.790> here<00:05:01.120> for

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
it's a little bit rubberized here for

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.630 
it's a little bit rubberized here for
some<00:05:01.480> traction<00:05:01.720> but<00:05:02.020> if<00:05:02.110> they<00:05:02.470> get<00:05:02.650> wet<00:05:02.800> they
