00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
cultural change though I cannot explain

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
cultural change though I cannot explain
why<00:00:34.440> every<00:00:35.280> step<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.579> take<00:00:35.610> towards<00:00:36.149> my<00:00:36.270> target

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
why every step I take towards my target
brings<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> glowing<00:00:37.680> sense<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.129> dread

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
brings with it a glowing sense of dread

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
brings with it a glowing sense of dread
I'm<00:00:38.670> haunted<00:00:39.360> by<00:00:39.629> twisted<00:00:40.350> dreams<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.950> seem

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
I'm haunted by twisted dreams that seem

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
I'm haunted by twisted dreams that seem
to<00:00:41.370> grow<00:00:41.579> increasingly<00:00:42.000> vivid<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.989> each

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to grow increasingly vivid with each

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
to grow increasingly vivid with each
passing<00:00:43.649> night<00:00:44.040> perhaps<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> spirits<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> My

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
passing night perhaps the spirits of My

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.529 
passing night perhaps the spirits of My
Ancestors<00:00:45.930> seek<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.620> warn<00:00:46.829> me<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.219> dark

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
Ancestors seek to warn me of a dark

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.020 
Ancestors seek to warn me of a dark
uncertain<00:00:48.539> future<00:00:49.079> Takeo<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
uncertain future Takeo and this is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
uncertain future Takeo and this is
interesting<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:51.780> before<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> letters

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
interesting because before the letters

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
interesting because before the letters
from<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> field<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.670> date<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.210> 1917<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
from the field would date into 1917 and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.950 
from the field would date into 1917 and
now<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.770> 19<00:00:56.399> 18<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.570> means<00:00:57.780> there's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
now we have 19 18 so that means there's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.450 
now we have 19 18 so that means there's
been<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.320> bit<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> time<00:00:58.920> length<00:00:59.219> between

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
been a little bit of time length between

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.540 
been a little bit of time length between
and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.219> set

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and I think with this one it's set

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
and I think with this one it's set
actually<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.300> our<00:01:03.629> origins<00:01:04.409> zombies<00:01:04.500> map<00:01:05.010> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually in our origins zombies map it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually in our origins zombies map it's
actually<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:05.820> they've<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.180> gotten<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
actually now they've actually gotten to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.350 
actually now they've actually gotten to
France<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.799> interesting<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.360> Takeo

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
France and it's interesting that Takeo

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.730 
France and it's interesting that Takeo
mentions<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:11.100> haunted<00:01:11.670> sleep<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.780> may

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
mentions about a haunted sleep which may

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.730 
mentions about a haunted sleep which may
be<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.250> sign<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.970> why<00:01:15.210> he's<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.840> crazy<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.650> I'm

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
be a sign of why he's so crazy but I'm

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
be a sign of why he's so crazy but I'm
not<00:01:16.920> too<00:01:17.130> sure<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.580> something<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.360> notice<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
not too sure but something to notice is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
not too sure but something to notice is
that<00:01:18.960> again<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> letters<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:20.400> the
