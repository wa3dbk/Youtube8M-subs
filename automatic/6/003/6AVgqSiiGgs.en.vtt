your six by six if you want to do this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:33.889 
your six by six if you want to do this
yourself<00:00:23.550> too<00:00:32.120> and<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.239> you're<00:00:33.420> wondering<00:00:33.450> why

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
i'm using a six by six that's because

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.569 
i'm using a six by six that's because
the<00:00:36.690> face<00:00:36.930> itself<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.680> six<00:00:38.550> by<00:00:38.700> six<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.520> we

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the face itself is six by six so now we

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.229 
the face itself is six by six so now we
got<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> eyes<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.739> like<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
got the eyes here like that and see the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
got the eyes here like that and see the
eyes<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.079> relative<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> six-by-six

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
eyes you know relative to the six-by-six

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.529 
eyes you know relative to the six-by-six
block<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:52.199> about<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> size<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.329> we're

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
block there about that size so now we're

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:12.410 
block there about that size so now we're
going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.860> part<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.219> here

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.899 

and<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.380> let<00:01:14.130> me<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:16.340> can<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.520> these<00:01:17.549> two

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and we can let me see I can do these two

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.789 
and we can let me see I can do these two
parts<00:01:18.240> too<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:21.170> could<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> done<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.649> at

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
parts too I could have done them all at

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.389 
parts too I could have done them all at
one<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.960> be<00:01:24.960> easier<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> follow<00:01:25.830> like

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
one time but be easier to follow like

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:41.179 
one time but be easier to follow like
this<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.659> need<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.020> peace<00:01:40.409> these

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
this now we need to get peace these

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.060 
this now we need to get peace these
pieces<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.909> these<00:01:42.390> pieces<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.990> which<00:01:43.950> are

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
pieces here these pieces here which are

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:54.290 
pieces here these pieces here which are
going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.970> three<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.659> these<00:01:45.810> three

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:19.110 

think<00:01:55.300> of<00:01:55.420> how<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.600> could<00:01:55.930> work<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.940> when

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
think of how that could work now when

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.620 
think of how that could work now when
you<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.360> need<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.600> make<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.870> final<00:02:20.260> two<00:02:21.630> this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
you just need to make the final two this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.560 
you just need to make the final two this
part<00:02:22.840> might<00:02:22.959> be<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.110> little<00:02:23.290> tricky<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> would

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
part might be a little tricky so I would

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.810 
part might be a little tricky so I would
recommend<00:02:25.600> just<00:02:26.320> kind<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:27.459> know<00:02:27.489> since

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
recommend just kind of you know since

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.430 
recommend just kind of you know since
you<00:02:27.940> can't<00:02:28.300> make<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.570> face<00:02:28.870> all<00:02:29.140> over<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you can't make this face all over the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.800 
you can't make this face all over the
cube<00:02:29.830> I'm<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:31.060> going<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.390> go<00:02:31.570> ahead<00:02:31.660> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
cube I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.760 
cube I'm just going to go ahead and
bring<00:02:32.080> these<00:02:32.350> down<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.950> make<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.650> is

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
bring these down and make it and this is

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.699 
bring these down and make it and this is
actually<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.160> first<00:02:39.190> time<00:02:39.459> doing<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.709> I'm
