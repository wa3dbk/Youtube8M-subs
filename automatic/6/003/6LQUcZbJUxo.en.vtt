00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
in the last three years it just really

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.260 
in the last three years it just really
pushed<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:37.050> storytelling<00:00:37.440> and

you feel that that the greatest
improvement<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> second<00:00:49.800> game<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.190> going

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
improvement in the second game is going

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.490 
improvement in the second game is going
to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.000> yeah<00:00:51.420> there's<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> improvements

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to be yeah there's a lot of improvements

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
to be yeah there's a lot of improvements
and<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.710> took<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.129> took<00:00:53.250> feedback<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:53.820> press

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and we took we took feedback from press

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
and we took we took feedback from press
from<00:00:54.390> fans<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.870> internal<00:00:55.140> sources<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> we

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
from fans from internal sources and we

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
from fans from internal sources and we
applied<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:56.879> across<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> board

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
applied it pretty much across the board

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
applied it pretty much across the board
so<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:57.750> talk<00:00:57.899> about<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> different<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.559> number

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
so I'll talk about a different a number

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.410 
so I'll talk about a different a number
of<00:00:58.859> different<00:00:58.949> areas<00:00:59.430> we're<00:00:59.609> improving<00:00:59.820> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of different areas we're improving that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.970 
of different areas we're improving that
I<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:00.989> exciting<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I think are all really exciting one of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
I think are all really exciting one of
the<00:01:02.070> areas<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.969> most<00:01:03.180> visible<00:01:03.480> maybe<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the areas the most visible maybe the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.149 
the areas the most visible maybe the
players<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> intensity<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
players is the intensity of the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
players is the intensity of the
experience<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> areas<00:01:07.110> that's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
experience and one of the areas that's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
experience and one of the areas that's
in<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.590> intense<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> combat<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> as

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
in more intense is combat so this is as

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.260 
in more intense is combat so this is as
much<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.750> shooter<00:01:10.170> action<00:01:10.770> game<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> as

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
much a shooter action game as is it as

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
much a shooter action game as is it as
it<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.720> RPG<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> almost<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it is an RPG so it's almost like a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.950 
it is an RPG so it's almost like a
shooter<00:01:14.220> RPG<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.880> we've<00:01:15.509> improved<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
shooter RPG and we've improved the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
shooter RPG and we've improved the
precision<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.500> controls<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.100> combat<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
precision of controls and combat so it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
precision of controls and combat so it
feels<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.180> tight<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.720> you're<00:01:19.380> playing

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
feels really tight as you're playing

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
feels really tight as you're playing
through<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.850> improved<00:01:21.360> cover<00:01:21.600> system

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
through it we have improved cover system

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.380 
through it we have improved cover system
a<00:01:22.320> very<00:01:22.650> dynamic<00:01:22.799> system<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> AI<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.299> your

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
a very dynamic system of AI for your

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080 
a very dynamic system of AI for your
party<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> moment-to-moment<00:01:25.729> movement<00:01:26.729> system

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
party a moment-to-moment movement system

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
party a moment-to-moment movement system
they<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.330> tactical<00:01:28.200> control<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
they have tactical control on the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.140 
they have tactical control on the
battlefield<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> deploy<00:01:30.119> your

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
battlefield over where you deploy your

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
battlefield over where you deploy your
party<00:01:30.570> members<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.619> these<00:01:31.740> things

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
party members and all these things

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
party members and all these things
combined<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> very<00:01:33.000> visceral<00:01:33.869> experience

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
combined into a very visceral experience

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
combined into a very visceral experience

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
very intense experience that again it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.700 
very intense experience that again it
really<00:01:36.540> makes<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> feel<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.439> shooter

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
really makes it feel like it's a shooter

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
really makes it feel like it's a shooter
as<00:01:37.890> much<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.189> anything<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.030> intensity

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
as much as anything now that intensity

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
as much as anything now that intensity
translates<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.320> dialogue<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.950> well

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
translates to the dialogue as well

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
translates to the dialogue as well
because<00:01:41.340> there's<00:01:41.460> interrupts<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> take

of years and so smart and intelligent

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.349 
of years and so smart and intelligent
but<00:03:50.959> really<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.799> lift<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.190> veil<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.790> behind

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
but really you lift the veil and behind

but really you lift the veil and behind
the<00:03:53.480> scenes<00:03:53.690> it's<00:03:53.959> actually<00:03:54.230> pretty<00:03:54.350> dark<00:03:54.680> and

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
the scenes it's actually pretty dark and

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.860 
the scenes it's actually pretty dark and
sinister<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.340> many<00:03:55.489> ways<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.540> even<00:03:56.750> more

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
sinister in many ways and it's even more

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.090 
sinister in many ways and it's even more
so<00:03:57.079> now<00:03:57.109> because<00:03:57.440> there's<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.650> greater<00:03:58.010> threat

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
so now because there's a greater threat

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.590 
so now because there's a greater threat
and<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.489> greater<00:03:58.700> menace<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.180> has<00:03:59.299> emerged

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
and a greater menace that has emerged

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.180 
and a greater menace that has emerged
even<00:04:00.139> greater<00:04:00.319> than<00:04:00.530> what<00:04:00.709> was<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:00.950> Mass

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
even greater than what was in Mass

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.069 
even greater than what was in Mass
Effect<00:04:01.459> one<00:04:01.639> that's<00:04:01.850> sort<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.090> really<00:04:03.049> the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
Effect one that's sort of the really the

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.539 
Effect one that's sort of the really the
sort<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.470> root<00:04:03.620> cause<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:03.889> it<00:04:04.160> all<00:04:04.250> has

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
sort of the root cause of it all has

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.430 
sort of the root cause of it all has
come<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.880> bear<00:04:05.030> as<00:04:05.150> well<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.569> not<00:04:06.019> only<00:04:06.139> are<00:04:06.290> you

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
come to bear as well so not only are you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.930 
come to bear as well so not only are you
really<00:04:06.560> seeing<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.160> Galactic<00:04:07.609> Civilizations

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
really seeing the Galactic Civilizations

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.910 
really seeing the Galactic Civilizations
for<00:04:08.359> what<00:04:08.450> they<00:04:08.600> really<00:04:08.630> are<00:04:08.900> you're<00:04:09.769> also

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
for what they really are you're also

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.530 
for what they really are you're also
seeing<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.430> greater<00:04:10.819> Menace<00:04:11.209> for<00:04:11.359> what<00:04:11.450> it

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
seeing this greater Menace for what it

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.379 
seeing this greater Menace for what it
really<00:04:11.569> is<00:04:11.840> too<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.829> it's<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.639> dark<00:04:13.850> second<00:04:14.239> act

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
really is too so it's a dark second act

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.170 
really is too so it's a dark second act
as<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.600> result

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
as a result

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.849 
as a result
and<00:04:15.329> hence<00:04:16.049> why<00:04:16.259> it's<00:04:16.289> almost<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:16.829> a

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
and hence why it's almost like a

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.080 
and hence why it's almost like a
suicidal<00:04:17.310> mission<00:04:17.489> unless<00:04:17.789> you<00:04:17.940> get<00:04:18.030> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
suicidal mission unless you get the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.659 
suicidal mission unless you get the
right<00:04:18.269> resources<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:18.900> your<00:04:19.019> side<00:04:19.489> well<00:04:20.489> we've
