 hi hi this video is about shopping i am you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.350
 will show that I bought some purchases 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.469
 bought from laura mercier 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 highlighter liquid and powder powder 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.740
 mineral 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.080
 she has only one tone that's finish 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.560
 powder lies down transparently mattes slightly 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 skin 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 there is a lockable mechanism also me 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.119
 advised to apply this powder such 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.859
 puff and I in the same place it immediately acquired by 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 quality, it is usually possible in principle 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.329
 buy or use another 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 there is a ribbon to help keep the sponge 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.860
 in the hands and as my favorite blog says 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.829
 gas make-up artist for such puffs 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.079
 powder need turning out puff 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.719
 then breaking a little distribute the powder 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.559
 here such movements shake well and 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.900
 can be applied 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.660
 the powder will be smoother 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.180
 liquid highlighter was in two colors with 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.830
 pink and yellow hue I got out 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.190
 there is a beautiful golden yellow 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.310
 a small shimmer that gave me such a sample 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.170
 to the tonal tool and I also took 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.000
 samples of face cream moon sol this one 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 from the luxury sky ruler want 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 try and here this highlighter girls 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.760
 who has 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 tell me how he behaves with me 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.440
 for example, it is squeezed out by some 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 sausage it's not liquid for some reason when i 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.250
 He was tested and in the store he was 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.920
 thin there was no such 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.050
 by himself he does not like him 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 looks but it goes very bad if 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.479
 it does not shade further I bought here 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.610
 this mascara for eyebrows this brand is Japanese 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.170
 inexpensive cosmetics of good quality 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.900
 can be purchased in any cosmetic 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.790
 Japan store or pharmacy mascara for 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.130
 eyebrow was in two colors I chose 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.170
 number 2 on the eyebrows it looks darker 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 than in a tube this shade is suitable 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.900
 Carlson, what I think brunettes, too, 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.420
 smooths and gives light but for 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.270
 fixing in style on honest up brows 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.990
 not quite fit I wanted everything for myself 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.750
 to find 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.090
 vodka on his brow barking and that is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.250
 little bit there draw hairs and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 Thought and better from above spat anya 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 brown i will and how the liner on 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.950
 eyes and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.410
 and no difference for eyebrows 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.310
 No, I just watched that color 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.790
 he was a gray undertone because the liner 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.280
 brown not mostly with redhead i 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.290
 I found more or less such a liner 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.630
 I already have the same very black 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.519
 look cool on the eyebrows of the girl 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.769
 really exit can buy lana 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.900
 brown leg to draw 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.060
 yourself tidy hairs so that it 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.750
 it was imperceptible like that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.750
 good bought 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.680
 such blush was very praised by the girl 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.000
 blogger Jacqueline forces who can inspect her 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.460
 blog on the fact that they are very 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.740
 pigmented and this project exactly 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.590
 color she said pigmentation just 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.070
 mad they are kinda like powdery but in 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 same time they are so soft and with 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.960
 They are very easy to overdo packaging 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.620
 looks nice but she unfortunately from 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.120
 plastic 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.820
 open a little difficult 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.930
 inside beautiful blush with small fine 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.210
 golden shimmer 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.030
 there is also a mirror and a tassel tassel 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.820
 bad did not try and recruit it is rude 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.830
 and hairs thick guna on soft 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.660
 nice texture fall flat 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.260
 transmit light well 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.599
 shade 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.180
 beautifully myself lipstick I bought for some reason 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.470
 I want to say that this light looks like you know 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.170
 when there is such a grape dye 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.579
 for example some jelly with red 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.200
 grapes and she looks like 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.590
 purple but at the same time pink 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.030
 That's how it looks on the lips looks 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.030
 absolutely matte 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.549
 Here is such a thing, and the whole is not water 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.450
 unusual though looking like a bottle with 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.220
 water is a body tonic for such 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.319
 quick application of moisturizer 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.420
 so before i did so if i 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.190
 some tonic does not fit he has 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.400
 some moisturizing ingredients without 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.030
 Picts, we believe I poured into a bottle with 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.820
 sprayer and used it like 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.460
 body care and I to my 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.169
 man also pouring in my bottle 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.650
 tonic that does not suit me now and 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:33.860
 he just pshikat and moisturizing thereby 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.620
 hands without using cream here if girls 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.289
 your men hate cream just here 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.770
 this is an outlet for lithium jar moisturizing 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.680
 tonic 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.880
 they will be comfortable and wookie me 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.400
 moisturized but this is such an idea to me very 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.530
 I liked what I found here 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.289
 means it is much cheaper than tonic 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.240
 of course because I think here is not 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.960
 such a straight care composition as for 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.660
 faces 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.380
 but still a very good thing and i 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.030
 I think it's very convenient especially on 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.340
 summer when you do not want to put 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.660
 thick cream you want faster already 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.180
 run out 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.280
 for example when are you in a hurry except 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.720
 the manufacturer writes lotion 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.210
 soothes the skin after long 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.789
 sun and after shave 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.699
 can be used as a normal tonic for 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.039
 faces and as an extra 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.380
 daily hair care 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.820
 these were all my purchases hope you 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.690
 I liked the video, we have something interesting 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.970
 looked after yourself and if anyone had 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.160
 write something from this product 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.330
 impressions thank you very much for 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.330
 bye bye bye
