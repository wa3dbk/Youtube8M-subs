 more 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.369
 by percent 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.509
 Herne percent 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.530
 Hello I am the one I can speak openly at the same time wanted Caracas NBC 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.020
 everything to serve that's why he needs it 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.660
 it is very clear 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.830
 arranged well within reach 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.550
 Above all things are important and so three categories for sound generation piano 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.930
 the piano 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.100
 but would know those we can apply 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.390
 Each category has three subcategories with three songs each 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.430
 Simon Serges Towns are available 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.110
 at a 14 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.670
 These are always very high quality 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.270
 great value with the Piano SMOS 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.360
 only fresh shirt is placed 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 not to forget this militia action 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.010
 On the right side 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.320
 It is used for transport control and playback of Midi mp3 image data and so on 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.829
 continue 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.829
 but also in digital world and so on 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.590
 we come to the first soundcheck 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.180
 in the Caribbean Piano Concert 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.830
 Son 1 s 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.480
 the new concept was piano bass work is outraged very thought-playing it 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 possible all big part of strength very well representable 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.050
 and very good yet reason Doctor as it comes 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.620
 percent 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.469
 Dr 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.469
 Arn 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.939
 to represent the various risks well 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.869
 has really move piano types for example here piano does that 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.869
 meant 1 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.839

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.429
 Dr 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.260
 but not the blame of voter access denied us so very early 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.909
 the fear goes out 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.930
 Here is just an example to hear what is possible 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.490
 What you will also get here is that a very dynamic game is possible 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.040
 and this the Anspiel is not only made possible by the fine pass 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.739
 the keyboard also contributes to this 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.179
 and we have cabaret 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.449
 a nature "Maybe it was just fine 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.509
 long was clenched but not Harnik 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.389
 which conducts very well very fine 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.519
 This keyboard CEO is known from the ch 93 and poses in the area of â€‹â€‹the funder 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.209
 Literally handing over so far has added something to Pablo Pozo Finca 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.349
 heating here 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.059
 very nicely named button coverings as a political talk show 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.779
 The ivory is supposed to simulate old piano keyboards 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.559
 that the keyboard is very handy 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:37.839
 you can play cards very sweat and sucked something like that 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:41.479
 Overall, a round liquid and finance game is possible 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.979
 by dividing into different categories of sounds I have 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.439
 of course also the possibility to mix and teach this category 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.099
 this can lead to very nice effects 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.699

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.120
 May 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
 Source empty 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.900
 just 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.930
 it works very well 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.370
 the list of 10 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.370
 with the usb port of the right side 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.949
 It enables support for Red and Bentley 3 with support on a usb-stick 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.210
 and play 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.760
 So it's called an mp3 perpetrated where is there is what has cut out of it 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.670
 to be able to play myself or what I say plays record as a speaker 3 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.719
 I also like the pine r out of the exits 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:43.979
 and page 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.789
 the one problem is creating a trouble free club to enable a piquet 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.740
 All in all, a PC is a very successful instrument 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.180
 Send from the foot so everything he needs for the stage 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.470
 and fun to play great house 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.419
 great operating concept 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.119
 I think one of the top ten players 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:06.119
 the currencies on the market 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:09.999
 the at the stern
