00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
setting and mechanics and the main part

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.360 
setting and mechanics and the main part
of<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.470> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.220> hideout<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> base

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
of this is the hideout which is a base

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
of this is the hideout which is a base
operation<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.760> serious<00:00:42.239> nicer<00:00:42.659> and<00:00:43.170> from

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
operation for serious nicer and from

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.540 
operation for serious nicer and from
here<00:00:44.430> we'll<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:45.030> able<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.449> select<00:00:45.930> which

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
here we'll be able to select which

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.920 
here we'll be able to select which
strongholds<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.760> attack<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.690> there's

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
strongholds to attack because there's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.910 
strongholds to attack because there's
eight<00:00:49.199> new<00:00:49.920> worlds<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.699> it<00:00:51.539> also<00:00:51.719> provides<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
shelter for allies so it seems we'll

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.910 
shelter for allies so it seems we'll
have<00:00:55.829> allies<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.269> new<00:00:57.480> game<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.109> the
