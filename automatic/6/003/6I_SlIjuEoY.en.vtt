I<00:00:50.180> observed<00:00:51.180> there<00:00:51.800> on<00:00:52.800> Mars<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.989> 1954<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I observed there on Mars in 1954 I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.470 
I observed there on Mars in 1954 I
believe<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.250> 50<00:00:56.670> -<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.239> said

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
believe it was now not 50 - like I said

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.799 
believe it was now not 50 - like I said
earlier<00:00:58.219> an<00:00:59.219> explosion<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.149> Mars

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
earlier an explosion on Mars

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.279 
earlier an explosion on Mars
I<00:01:01.020> had<00:01:01.800> 58<00:01:02.280> seconds<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> explosion

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
I had 58 seconds of that explosion

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.050 
I had 58 seconds of that explosion
there<00:01:04.770> was<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:05.309> people<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.940> earth

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

Selig's<00:01:06.539> observed<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> explosion<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.250> me

he<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> Japanese<00:01:09.260> astronomer<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.770> both

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
he was a Japanese astronomer we both

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.719 
he was a Japanese astronomer we both
observed<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> same<00:01:12.210> area<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> Mars

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
observed it in the same area of Mars

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.149 
observed it in the same area of Mars
what<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.830> an

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
what it was I don't know but it was an

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.380 
what it was I don't know but it was an
explosion<00:01:18.950> why<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.490> no<00:01:20.640> idea

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
explosion why I have no idea

explosion why I have no idea
I<00:01:21.420> honestly<00:01:22.110> wonder<00:01:22.799> whether<00:01:23.009> Martians<00:01:23.580> exist

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
I honestly wonder whether Martians exist

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.280 
I honestly wonder whether Martians exist

involved in many other items and their
activities<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.350> science<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:33.380> had<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.740> experience

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
activities in science I had a experience

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.920 
activities in science I had a experience
in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.170> LEAs<00:01:37.380> center<00:01:38.130> America<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.000> two

objects flying overhead that I was

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.600 
objects flying overhead that I was
informed<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.070> month<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.430> so

five witnesses observing this the globe
we<00:01:54.270> shoot<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.840> line<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.500> energy<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.670> front

we shoot a line of energy out in front

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.690 
we shoot a line of energy out in front
of<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.649> there<00:01:58.649> was<00:01:58.770> another<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.310> front<00:01:59.520> of

that line of energy that would shoot a

would they would ride that line of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.780 
would they would ride that line of
energy<00:02:07.170> until<00:02:07.530> near<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.890> end<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:08.489> shoot

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
energy until near the end and then shoot

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.479 
energy until near the end and then shoot
another<00:02:09.090> line<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.600> energy<00:02:09.750> through<00:02:10.530> both<00:02:10.769> to

another line of energy through both to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.550 
another line of energy through both to
be<00:02:11.670> able<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.970> energize<00:02:12.569> their<00:02:12.930> craft<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
be able to energize their craft I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
be able to energize their craft I
watched<00:02:13.800> them<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:14.400> maybe<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.060> minute<00:02:15.239> minute

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
watched them for maybe a minute minute

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.190 
watched them for maybe a minute minute

website you can observe what I have on
it<00:02:35.220> about<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.940> onion<00:02:36.450> drive<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.470> believe

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
it about the onion drive I do believe

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.640 
it about the onion drive I do believe
it's<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.640> system<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.390> propulsion<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.200> can

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it's a system of propulsion that can

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.240 
it's a system of propulsion that can
take<00:02:41.310> our<00:02:41.550> astronauts<00:02:42.440> beyond<00:02:43.440> Earth<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
take our astronauts beyond Earth to the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.430 
take our astronauts beyond Earth to the
moon<00:02:44.430> Mars<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.180> beyond<00:02:45.599> here<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> other

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.229 
moon Mars and beyond here to the other
planets<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.400> believe<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.810> an<00:02:49.080> active

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
planets I believe it is an active

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.000 
planets I believe it is an active
propulsion<00:02:51.239> method<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.959> probably<00:02:52.560> may<00:02:52.830> have

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
propulsion method that probably may have

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.210 
propulsion method that probably may have
already<00:02:53.459> been<00:02:53.989> created<00:02:54.989> by<00:02:55.769> either<00:02:55.950> our

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
already been created by either our

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.770 
already been created by either our
government<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:56.850> our<00:02:57.090> government<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
government or our government and the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.180 
government or our government and the
other<00:02:57.930> governments<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.560> our<00:02:58.830> government

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
other governments that our government

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.449 
other governments that our government
works<00:02:59.400> with<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.880> earth<00:03:00.150> meaning<00:03:00.660> Russia

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
works with on earth meaning Russia

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.550 
works with on earth meaning Russia
so<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:03.180> hopes<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.080> such<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.410> thing

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
so we hopes that we have such a thing

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.170 
so we hopes that we have such a thing
now<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.569> have<00:03:06.769> spoken<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.160> astronauts<00:03:08.970> that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
now I have spoken to astronauts that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
now I have spoken to astronauts that
have<00:03:09.510> seen<00:03:09.810> things<00:03:10.080> on<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> moon<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.950> good

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
have seen things on the moon a good

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.309 
have seen things on the moon a good
