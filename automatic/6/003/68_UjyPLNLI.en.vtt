00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:03.890 
ok so I made some changes to this build

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.760 
ok so I made some changes to this build
the<00:00:04.890> assault<00:00:05.190> Cruiser<00:00:05.430> build<00:00:05.779> based<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.080> input

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the assault Cruiser build based on input

the assault Cruiser build based on input
from<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.250> forum<00:00:09.120> thread<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:10.230> I've<00:00:10.380> done<00:00:10.410> is

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
from the forum thread what I've done is

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.999 
from the forum thread what I've done is
I've<00:00:11.519> moved<00:00:12.509> fire<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.110> World<00:00:13.290> Tree<00:00:13.559> back<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
I've moved fire at World Tree back to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.530 
I've moved fire at World Tree back to
fire<00:00:14.190> will<00:00:14.400> too<00:00:14.610> when<00:00:14.820> replaced<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
fire will too when replaced it with the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.160 
fire will too when replaced it with the
stock<00:00:15.719> been<00:00:15.900> embedded<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:17.960> add<00:00:18.960> an

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
stock been embedded to I add an

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.870 
stock been embedded to I add an
emergency<00:00:19.710> part<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.130> weapons<00:00:20.460> where<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> had

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
emergency part of weapons where I had

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720 
emergency part of weapons where I had
the<00:00:21.060> emergency<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.720> auxiliary<00:00:22.109> before<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.859> I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the emergency to auxiliary before and I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.720 
the emergency to auxiliary before and I
started<00:00:24.060> using<00:00:24.240> auxiliary<00:00:24.900> batteries

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
started using auxiliary batteries

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.179 
started using auxiliary batteries
instead<00:00:26.840> for<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.990> little<00:00:28.199> auxiliary<00:00:28.859> buff<00:00:29.039> I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
instead for that little auxiliary buff I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.389 
instead for that little auxiliary buff I
used<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.779> auxiliary<00:00:30.779> dependent<00:00:31.679> abilities<00:00:32.130> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
used to auxiliary dependent abilities so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.380 
used to auxiliary dependent abilities so
it<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.850> matter<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:35.120> are<00:00:36.120> placed

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it really matter but on your are placed

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
it really matter but on your are placed

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
engineering team tree with auxiliary to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
engineering team tree with auxiliary to

the power auxiliary power to the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.160 

let<00:00:46.250> me<00:00:46.370> see<00:00:46.580> I<00:00:46.850> think<00:00:47.240> that's<00:00:47.390> it<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.720> kept

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
let me see I think that's it I kept

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.720 
let me see I think that's it I kept
metreon<00:00:48.620> I'm<00:00:48.890> going<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.130> have<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.280> dump<00:00:49.580> it

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
metreon I'm going to have to dump it

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.450 
metreon I'm going to have to dump it
because<00:00:49.910> it's<00:00:50.030> pretty<00:00:50.240> useless<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.430> no<00:00:52.430> I

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
because it's pretty useless but no I

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.650 
because it's pretty useless but no I
didn't<00:00:52.700> know<00:00:52.760> what<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:52.970> put<00:00:53.000> in<00:00:53.270> there<00:00:53.390> so

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
didn't know what to put in there so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.500 
didn't know what to put in there so
whatever<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.950> I<00:00:55.040> just<00:00:55.190> didn't<00:00:55.640> infected

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
whatever and I just didn't infected

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.210 
whatever and I just didn't infected
space<00:00:56.780> room<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:58.550> clocked<00:00:58.940> in<00:00:59.120> at<00:00:59.300> 9.3<00:01:00.200> k<00:01:00.710> dps

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
space room it clocked in at 9.3 k dps

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.580 
space room it clocked in at 9.3 k dps
and<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.970> is<00:01:02.090> great<00:01:02.330> tree<00:01:02.840> engineers<00:01:03.320> in<00:01:03.500> the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
and that is great tree engineers in the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.790 
and that is great tree engineers in the
battle<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.360> if<00:01:05.360> people<00:01:05.600> saying<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:06.410> the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
battle so if people saying that if the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.120 
battle so if people saying that if the
original<00:01:07.160> dps<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.390> result<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.200> having<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.979> ton

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
original dps is a result of having a ton

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.120 
original dps is a result of having a ton
of<00:01:10.160> tactical<00:01:10.700> fleets<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.240> debuffs<00:01:12.130> it's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
of tactical fleets and debuffs it's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.530 
of tactical fleets and debuffs it's
pretty<00:01:13.370> obviously<00:01:13.820> not<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.540> case<00:01:14.570> oh<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:16.040> also

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
pretty obviously not the case oh I also

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.790 
pretty obviously not the case oh I also
replaced<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.810> beam<00:01:17.990> array<00:01:18.259> with<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
replaced a beam array with the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.999 
replaced a beam array with the
experimental<00:01:19.900> Romulan<00:01:20.900> plasma<00:01:21.440> beam<00:01:21.619> array<00:01:21.830> I

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
experimental Romulan plasma beam array I

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.270 
experimental Romulan plasma beam array I
just<00:01:22.610> did<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:23.630> testing<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:24.979> turned<00:01:25.160> out

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
just did for testing and it turned out

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.760 
just did for testing and it turned out
good<00:01:25.869> I'm<00:01:26.869> thinking<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.410> doing<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.979> Romulan<00:01:29.770> be

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
good I'm thinking of doing a Romulan be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.430 
good I'm thinking of doing a Romulan be
Maria<00:01:31.070> build<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:32.450> they're<00:01:32.600> so

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
Maria build but they're so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.620 
Maria build but they're so
expensive<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:34.160> don't<00:01:34.460> know<00:01:34.630> twenty-eight

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
expensive I don't know twenty-eight

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.719 
expensive I don't know twenty-eight
thousand<00:01:35.990> dollar<00:01:36.140> item<00:01:36.380> apiece<00:01:36.680> I<00:01:36.920> think

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
thousand dollar item apiece I think

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.389 
thousand dollar item apiece I think
there<00:01:37.850> could<00:01:37.940> be<00:01:38.000> really<00:01:38.210> nice<00:01:38.450> for<00:01:38.479> work<00:01:38.899> 12

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
there could be really nice for work 12

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.820 
there could be really nice for work 12

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.640 
it was kind of anticlimactic
I<00:05:05.259> thought<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.009> was<00:05:06.069> fun

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
I thought it was fun

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.620 
I thought it was fun
but<00:05:08.190> wasn't<00:05:08.310> really<00:05:08.580> much<00:05:08.699> fighting<00:05:09.030> sherry

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
but wasn't really much fighting sherry

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.809 
but wasn't really much fighting sherry
but<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.800> was<00:05:10.919> cool<00:05:11.130> story

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.510 

what<00:05:14.819> am<00:05:14.909> I<00:05:14.969> going<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.150> do<00:05:15.270> with<00:05:15.449> this

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
what am I going to do with this

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.580 
what am I going to do with this
tier<00:05:17.520> 3<00:05:17.849> version<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.539> ship<00:05:18.779> just<00:05:18.960> keep<00:05:19.469> it

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
tier 3 version of the ship just keep it

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.959 
tier 3 version of the ship just keep it
in<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.740> box<00:05:19.919> forever<00:05:20.249> I<00:05:20.430> guess<00:05:20.610> all<00:05:20.849> these

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
in the box forever I guess all these

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.519 
in the box forever I guess all these
balloons<00:05:21.360> are<00:05:21.569> causing<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:21.960> massive<00:05:22.169> frame

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
balloons are causing a massive frame

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:28.899 
balloons are causing a massive frame
rate<00:05:22.740> leg<00:05:23.120> turning<00:05:24.120> everybody's<00:05:24.419> skin<00:05:24.839> black

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.399 

yeah<00:05:29.909> pixel<00:05:30.330> shaders<00:05:30.689> didn't<00:05:30.990> both<00:05:31.110> proper

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
yeah pixel shaders didn't both proper

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.679 
yeah pixel shaders didn't both proper
that's<00:05:31.710> got<00:05:32.159> to<00:05:32.249> be<00:05:32.309> what<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.520> was<00:05:32.669> three<00:05:33.419> start

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
that's got to be what it was three start

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.029 
that's got to be what it was three start
again<00:05:36.229> neither<00:05:37.229> that<00:05:37.409> on<00:05:37.499> my<00:05:37.589> graphics<00:05:37.979> card

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
again neither that on my graphics card

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:44.750 
again neither that on my graphics card
is<00:05:38.309> on<00:05:38.430> fire

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.470 

Oh<00:05:44.900> looks<00:05:45.900> like<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.260> fair<00:05:46.560> it's<00:05:46.800> doing<00:05:47.070> better

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
when just so many projectiles and stuff

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.490 
when just so many projectiles and stuff
on<00:06:39.730> screen<00:06:40.030> with<00:06:40.180> it<00:06:40.300> now<00:06:40.480> it's<00:06:40.690> fun<00:06:40.960> you<00:06:41.440> know

on screen with it now it's fun you know
how<00:06:41.770> like<00:06:42.550> projectiles<00:06:42.940> stop<00:06:43.390> rendering<00:06:43.660> and

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
how like projectiles stop rendering and

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.490 
how like projectiles stop rendering and
you<00:06:44.050> see<00:06:44.260> an<00:06:44.350> outline<00:06:44.500> and<00:06:46.020> sound<00:06:47.020> starts
