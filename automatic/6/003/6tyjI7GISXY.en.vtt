really<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.010> kind<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> grabbing<00:02:35.580> maybe<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
really just kind of grabbing maybe the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.480 
really just kind of grabbing maybe the
top<00:02:36.120> string<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> top<00:02:36.720> two

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.759 

okay<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.390> that's<00:02:51.689> kind<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.110> concept<00:02:52.650> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
okay so that's kind of the concept and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.699 
okay so that's kind of the concept and
this<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.489> classic<00:02:54.470> little<00:02:55.470> chord

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
this is a kind of a classic little chord

this is a kind of a classic little chord
progression<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> key<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.549> G<00:03:03.620> well<00:03:04.620> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
progression in the key of G well that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.250 
progression in the key of G well that
would<00:03:04.829> be<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.390> because<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.659> key<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.810> G<00:03:07.019> G

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
would be a one because in the key of G G

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.289 
would be a one because in the key of G G
is<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.680> chord<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.459> C<00:03:08.489> chord<00:03:09.060> would<00:03:09.239> be

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
is the one chord the C chord would be

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.039 
is the one chord the C chord would be
push<00:03:09.959> your<00:03:10.109> four<00:03:10.319> chord<00:03:10.730> D<00:03:11.730> seven<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.390> D<00:03:12.780> is

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
push your four chord D seven or D is
