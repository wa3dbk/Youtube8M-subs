00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.970 
go up to a local pond very small Lake
probably<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.260> size<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> tennis

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
probably about the size of a tennis

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.570 
probably about the size of a tennis
court<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.519> know<00:00:11.610> there's<00:00:12.590> at<00:00:13.590> least<00:00:13.650> six<00:00:14.400> or

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670 
court I know there's at least six or
seven<00:00:14.610> fish<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.120> there<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.690> about<00:00:15.870> 25<00:00:16.350> pound

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
seven fish in there up to about 25 pound

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.260 
seven fish in there up to about 25 pound
really<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.550> probably<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.029> third

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
really it's a it's probably the third

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
really it's a it's probably the third
time<00:00:18.539> I've<00:00:18.660> got<00:00:18.869> since<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.470> new<00:00:19.619> year<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.189> I'm

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
time I've got since the new year so I'm

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.269 
time I've got since the new year so I'm
just<00:00:21.270> getting<00:00:21.420> back<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.100> going

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
just getting back into it I'm just going

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.259 
just getting back into it I'm just going
to<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.519> there<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.850> bottom<00:00:24.119> rod

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
to go out there with a bottom rod

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.580 
to go out there with a bottom rod
probably<00:00:24.600> put<00:00:24.750> shoddy<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.230> because<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
probably put shoddy out because it is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.810 
probably put shoddy out because it is
quite<00:00:25.859> weedy<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:28.199> weather's

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
quite weedy like and the weather's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.040 
quite weedy like and the weather's
decent<00:00:29.820> enough<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.179> me<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.420> fish<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> top

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
decent enough for me to fish on the top

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930 
decent enough for me to fish on the top
so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.769> guess<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> next<00:00:32.219> time<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.730> me<00:00:32.790> I'll

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so I guess the next time you see me I'll

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.430 
so I guess the next time you see me I'll
be<00:00:32.969> by<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> lake<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.780> hopefully<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
be by the lake and hopefully of a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.889 
be by the lake and hopefully of a
fisherman's<00:00:35.180> well<00:00:36.180> I've<00:00:36.300> arrived<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
fisherman's well I've arrived at the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.400 
fisherman's well I've arrived at the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
pond and as you can see it's very small

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.279 
pond and as you can see it's very small
but<00:00:43.410> there<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> few<00:00:43.800> fish<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.289> try

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
but there are a few fish in it and try

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.889 
but there are a few fish in it and try

hopefully I've got that on about a two
foot<00:04:12.860> piece<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:14.860> fly<00:04:15.860> leader<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.340> Drennen<00:04:16.669> do

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
foot piece of fly leader that Drennen do

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.370 
foot piece of fly leader that Drennen do
double<00:04:17.269> strengthening<00:04:17.810> it's<00:04:17.959> cooled<00:04:18.169> and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
double strengthening it's cooled and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.900 
double strengthening it's cooled and
then<00:04:18.979> I've<00:04:19.070> tied<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.760> mainline<00:04:20.150> with

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
then I've tied that to the mainline with

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.310 
then I've tied that to the mainline with
some<00:04:22.910> sort<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.120> my<00:04:23.390> country<00:04:23.840> remember<00:04:24.200> what

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
some sort of my country remember what

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.560 
some sort of my country remember what
it's<00:04:24.440> called<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:25.550> that's<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:25.970> very<00:04:26.030> very

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
it's called and that's just very very

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.500 
it's called and that's just very very
thin<00:04:27.229> for<00:04:27.560> its<00:04:27.680> strength<00:04:28.430> at<00:04:28.640> 12<00:04:28.970> pound<00:04:29.300> what

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
thin for its strength at 12 pound what

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.210 
thin for its strength at 12 pound what
I'm<00:04:29.570> using<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.500> think<00:04:30.680> that's<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.890> quarter

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
I'm using and I think that's a quarter

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.420 
I'm using and I think that's a quarter
mixer<00:04:31.910> hurt<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:33.590> yeah<00:04:33.770> I<00:04:33.800> prefer<00:04:34.010> not<00:04:34.370> to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
mixer hurt and so yeah I prefer not to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.640 
mixer hurt and so yeah I prefer not to
use<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.729> controller<00:04:35.180> float<00:04:35.479> purely<00:04:36.050> because

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.610 

and<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:40.250> think<00:04:40.850> be<00:04:41.630> self<00:04:41.960> fucking<00:04:42.260> control

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
and to I think be self fucking control

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.050 
and to I think be self fucking control
folks<00:04:42.890> takes<00:04:43.190> away<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.460> bit<00:04:43.669> of<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.790> fan<00:04:44.030> of

full<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.860> squid<00:06:00.820> an<00:06:00.910> octopus<00:06:01.210> board'<00:06:01.420> as<00:06:01.540> well

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
full of squid an octopus board' as well

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.730 
full of squid an octopus board' as well
and<00:06:01.810> I'll<00:06:01.900> probably<00:06:02.050> put<00:06:02.320> a<00:06:02.350> handful<00:06:02.680> of

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
and I'll probably put a handful of

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.980 
and I'll probably put a handful of
pellet<00:06:03.040> out<00:06:03.130> there<00:06:03.370> I<00:06:03.550> don't<00:06:03.940> really<00:06:04.090> think<00:06:04.600> I

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
pellet out there I don't really think I

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.360 
pellet out there I don't really think I
should<00:06:05.020> over<00:06:05.380> feed<00:06:05.620> in<00:06:05.770> here<00:06:05.800> because<00:06:06.070> they

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
should over feed in here because they

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.500 
should over feed in here because they
don't<00:06:06.550> really<00:06:06.820> get<00:06:07.030> fed<00:06:07.360> a<00:06:07.510> lot<00:06:07.570> and<00:06:09.480> right<00:06:10.480> I

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
don't really get fed a lot and right I

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.290 
don't really get fed a lot and right I
just<00:06:10.900> found<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.170> fish<00:06:11.820> they<00:06:12.820> were<00:06:12.910> right<00:06:13.120> down

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
just found the fish they were right down

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.330 
just found the fish they were right down
the<00:06:13.420> corner<00:06:13.750> of<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:13.870> lake<00:06:14.050> under<00:06:14.740> some<00:06:15.100> shade

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
the corner of the lake under some shade

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.090 
the corner of the lake under some shade
of<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.580> tree<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.690> went<00:06:17.230> back<00:06:17.350> and<00:06:17.500> got<00:06:17.620> my<00:06:17.830> rod

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
of the tree I went back and got my rod

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.220 
of the tree I went back and got my rod
and<00:06:18.430> as<00:06:18.520> soon<00:06:18.640> as<00:06:18.730> I<00:06:18.820> flicked<00:06:19.090> it<00:06:19.210> within<00:06:19.990> two

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
and as soon as I flicked it within two

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.930 
and as soon as I flicked it within two
meters<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.770> mesh<00:06:20.950> boots<00:06:21.220> right<00:06:21.460> away<00:06:21.670> and

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
meters of the mesh boots right away and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.340 
meters of the mesh boots right away and
so<00:06:22.720> now<00:06:22.840> I'm<00:06:22.990> back<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.410> square<00:06:23.500> one<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:25.350> think

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
so now I'm back to square one I think

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.990 
so now I'm back to square one I think
I'm<00:06:26.470> only<00:06:26.620> gonna<00:06:26.770> give<00:06:27.310> it<00:06:27.400> another<00:06:27.580> half<00:06:27.670> an

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
I'm only gonna give it another half an

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.550 
I'm only gonna give it another half an
hour<00:06:28.150> and<00:06:28.450> then<00:06:28.780> if<00:06:28.960> I<00:06:29.050> haven't<00:06:29.260> had<00:06:29.350> anything

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
hour and then if I haven't had anything

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.159 
hour and then if I haven't had anything
I<00:06:29.770> think<00:06:29.950> I<00:06:30.010> might<00:06:30.160> pack<00:06:30.370> up<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:30.640> go

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.229
