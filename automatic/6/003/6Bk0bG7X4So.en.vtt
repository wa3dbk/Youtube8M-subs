00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.200
 novice drivers with you auto company 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.319
 roll forward 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.440
 ru today we do not drive a car and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.540
 We advise you to do this if you still 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.350
 you manage your transport 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.410
 means let's consider four 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.210
 important rules of inhibition 1 main 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.160
 second brake 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 engine braking third braking 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 handbrake fourth emergency 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.649
 forced braking if refused 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.899
 The main brakes are pressed to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.500
 curb so the first option 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 moving at high speed dropping 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.910
 gas 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 we start to slow down periodic 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.550
 by clicking you ask the question why 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.230
 periodically the fact is that we can not 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.140
 block wheels 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 if the wheels during heavy braking 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 blocked the car goes into a skid 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.610
 second option engine braking 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.510
 this option needs to be learned 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.299
 we're moving in fourth gear 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 reset the gas squeeze the clutch 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 include third gear 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.909
 The speed was great and the transfer was chosen 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.880
 little 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 gear ratio selected 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.490
 gear not matching the speed and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.540
 it means the car starts 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.619
 to brake by the engine in this case 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.759
 the wheels are not blocked by the third option 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.720
 handbrake handbrake brake on the rear wheels and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.079
 it means little effective in this situation 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.060
 with the exception of modern cars 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.990
 if we are in the far right 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.229
 strip 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.930
 either left means necessary if 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.020
 failed brakes snuggle up to the curb 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.740
 and thus produce inhibition but 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.490
 must be remembered if between stone and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.509
 there is a distance means the car can 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.630
 jump on the oncoming lane or on the pavement with 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.610
 you company auto forward. 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.930
 ru we congratulate you on 2013 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:29.550
 be careful in a similar situation 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.550
 best follow the speed limit
