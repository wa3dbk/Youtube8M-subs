riders<00:00:54.610> out<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.989> we've<00:00:56.140> got<00:00:56.170> these<00:00:56.440> four<00:00:56.710> big

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
riders out then we've got these four big

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.729 
riders out then we've got these four big
waves<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.629> fourth<00:00:58.870> one<00:00:59.019> there<00:00:59.199> on<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.409> inside

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739

starts to split itself earth becomes a

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.990 
starts to split itself earth becomes a
bit<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.170> rhythm<00:01:02.379> section<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:03.100> then<00:01:03.730> these

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
bit of a rhythm section and then these

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.240 
bit of a rhythm section and then these
holes<00:01:04.300> will<00:01:04.510> just<00:01:04.659> get<00:01:04.780> deeper<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:05.199> bigger<00:01:05.440> as

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
holes will just get deeper and bigger as

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.680 
holes will just get deeper and bigger as
they<00:01:06.370> go<00:01:06.520> through<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:06.820> left-hander<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.450> bark

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
they go through that left-hander a bark

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.399 
they go through that left-hander a bark
on<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.470> first<00:01:08.740> long<00:01:09.130> straight<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.380> the

on the first long straight out to the
far<00:01:11.650> side<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.010> circuit<00:01:12.370> over<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.610> single

far side of the circuit over a single
jump<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.240> landing<00:01:13.659> and<00:01:14.380> then<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.710> jump

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
jump and landing and then you can jump

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.940 
jump and landing and then you can jump
along<00:01:15.130> off<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.610> one<00:01:15.820> here<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.530> into

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
along off this one here and then into

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.350 
along off this one here and then into
the<00:01:18.100> left-hander<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.670> need<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.000> keep<00:01:19.150> up

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
the left-hander you need to keep up

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.890 
the left-hander you need to keep up
momentum<00:01:19.890> step<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.220> pegs<00:01:21.460> stand<00:01:22.450> up<00:01:22.690> let

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
momentum step on the pegs stand up let

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.200 
momentum step on the pegs stand up let
the<00:01:22.930> suspension<00:01:23.470> do<00:01:23.650> all<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.040> work<00:01:24.220> then<00:01:25.120> we

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the suspension do all the work then we

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.670 
the suspension do all the work then we
drop<00:01:25.360> down<00:01:25.570> into<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:25.900> right<00:01:26.110> hand<00:01:26.350> up<00:01:26.530> again

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
drop down into this right hand up again

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.230 
drop down into this right hand up again
there<00:01:27.130> might<00:01:27.220> be<00:01:27.280> some<00:01:27.460> overtaking<00:01:27.790> going<00:01:28.120> on

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
there might be some overtaking going on

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.900 
there might be some overtaking going on
through<00:01:29.200> their<00:01:29.409> of<00:01:29.500> course<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.920> weekend<00:01:30.280> this

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
through their of course the weekend this

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.460 
through their of course the weekend this
used<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.180> be<00:01:31.300> a<00:01:31.330> step<00:01:31.600> up<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.960> now<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:32.230> just<00:01:32.380> a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
used to be a step up and now it's just a

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.260 
used to be a step up and now it's just a
plateau<00:01:32.680> jump<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.340> then<00:01:33.430> about<00:01:33.520> 80<00:01:33.820> meters

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
plateau jump and then about 80 meters

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.210 
plateau jump and then about 80 meters
later<00:01:34.480> we<00:01:35.410> arrived<00:01:35.680> at<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.950> end<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.920 
practice but as the race goes on that'll
get<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:56.490> heavy<00:01:57.490> then<00:01:58.240> we<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:58.540> through<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
get pretty heavy then we go through the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.810 
get pretty heavy then we go through the
chicane<00:01:59.140> tree<00:01:59.740> offset<00:02:00.100> jumps<00:02:00.430> one's<00:02:00.640> the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
chicane tree offset jumps one's the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.250 
chicane tree offset jumps one's the

the main grandstand area and that will

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.480 
the main grandstand area and that will
get<00:02:34.900> pretty<00:02:35.170> grumpy<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.680> well<00:02:35.920> then<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.460> have

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
get pretty grumpy as well then we have

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.400 
get pretty grumpy as well then we have
this<00:02:36.730> jump<00:02:37.060> some<00:02:37.300> nice<00:02:37.480> jump<00:02:37.780> long<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.260> like

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
this jump some nice jump long and like

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.170 
this jump some nice jump long and like
to<00:02:38.530> land<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> corner<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.970> then<00:02:40.090> we

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
to land it in the corner but then we

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.700 
to land it in the corner but then we
have<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.390> split<00:02:40.600> section<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.140> can<00:02:41.170> go<00:02:41.350> round

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
have the split section you can go round

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.430 
have the split section you can go round
the<00:02:41.950> outside<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.870> go<00:02:43.960> tight<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
the outside or you can go tight to the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.780 
the outside or you can go tight to the
inside<00:02:44.710> either<00:02:44.950> way<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.430> series<00:02:45.760> of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
inside either way it's a series of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.540 
inside either way it's a series of
double<00:02:46.240> jumps<00:02:46.620> three<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.710> total<00:02:47.860> other<00:02:48.280> side

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
double jumps three in total other side

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.130 
double jumps three in total other side
and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.030> hit<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> final<00:02:49.569> turn<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> left

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and then we hit the final turn a left

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.690 
and then we hit the final turn a left
hander<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:52.150> then<00:02:52.270> as<00:02:52.390> we<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:53.340> into<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.520> look

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
hander and then as we get into here look

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.480 
hander and then as we get into here look
at<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.850> holes<00:02:55.740> through<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.770> final<00:02:57.130> turn<00:02:57.280> then

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
at the holes through the final turn then

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.370 
at the holes through the final turn then

over the Monster Energy finish line jump

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.140 
over the Monster Energy finish line jump
and<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.920> rejoin<00:03:00.340> down<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.760> straight<00:03:01.000> that

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
and we rejoin down the straight that

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:13.750 
and we rejoin down the straight that
takes<00:03:01.330> us<00:03:01.450> past<00:03:01.630> pit<00:03:01.990> lane
