this dog is nice it fits the iPad
beautifully<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.810> there<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.320> big<00:01:02.280> flaw<00:01:02.550> with

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
beautifully but there is a big flaw with

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.679 
beautifully but there is a big flaw with
this<00:01:03.619> iPad<00:01:04.619> dock<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.759> is<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.420> not

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
this iPad dock and that is that it's not

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.830 
this iPad dock and that is that it's not
stable<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.329> is<00:01:09.479> highly

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
stable as you can see that it is highly

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
stable as you can see that it is highly
shaky<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.670> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> tip<00:01:11.969> it<00:01:12.000> over<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
shaky and if you tip it over just a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.639 
shaky and if you tip it over just a
little<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:13.140> more<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> might<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.090> fall<00:01:15.299> off

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
little bit more it might just fall off

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.210 
little bit more it might just fall off
so<00:01:17.090> what<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so what do you do if you don't want to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.570 
so what do you do if you don't want to
