00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
temporarily okay so as you can see here

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.780 
temporarily okay so as you can see here
there<00:01:06.920> is<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.130> two-by-six<00:01:09.190> underneath<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
there is a two-by-six underneath the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.680 
there is a two-by-six underneath the
motherboard<00:01:11.530> okay<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.330> what<00:01:14.330> I've<00:01:14.570> done<00:01:15.460> is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
motherboard okay and what I've done is

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.469 
motherboard okay and what I've done is
instead<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.750> having<00:01:17.870> a<00:01:18.910> back<00:01:19.910> plate<00:01:20.150> or<00:01:20.450> a

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
instead of having a back plate or a

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.210 
instead of having a back plate or a
backboard<00:01:22.930> what<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.650> screw<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
backboard what you do is you screw the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.109 
backboard what you do is you screw the
heatsink<00:01:25.910> as<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:27.290> can<00:01:27.440> see<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.680> have<00:01:27.830> some<00:01:28.280> deck

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
heatsink as you can see I have some deck

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.469 
heatsink as you can see I have some deck
screws<00:01:29.570> here<00:01:29.869> or<00:01:30.770> these<00:01:31.070> are<00:01:31.310> outdoor<00:01:32.180> screws

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
screws here or these are outdoor screws

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.430 
screws here or these are outdoor screws
anyway<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:34.130> are<00:01:34.250> about<00:01:34.400> three<00:01:34.759> inch<00:01:34.880> long

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
anyway that are about three inch long

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.190 
anyway that are about three inch long
they<00:01:36.440> go<00:01:36.619> down<00:01:36.860> into<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.820> two<00:01:38.810> by<00:01:38.960> six<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:42.110> you

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
they go down into the two by six so you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.639 
they go down into the two by six so you
see<00:01:42.470> there's<00:01:42.649> no<00:01:42.830> pressure<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.729> board

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
see there's no pressure on the board

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.740 
see there's no pressure on the board
because<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:45.830> pulling<00:01:46.280> rate<00:01:46.490> against<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
because it's pulling rate against the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
because it's pulling rate against the
back<00:01:47.960> like<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.500> bottom<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.160> socket

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
back like the bottom of the socket

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
back like the bottom of the socket
because<00:01:51.770> that's<00:01:51.979> where<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.250> woods<00:01:52.460> going<00:01:52.700> to

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
because that's where the woods going to

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.550 
because that's where the woods going to
be<00:01:52.880> pushing<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.420> right<00:01:53.630> where<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.990> sock<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.440> is

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
be pushing is right where the sock it is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.440 
be pushing is right where the sock it is
because<00:01:54.830> that's<00:01:54.950> where<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.340> pushing<00:01:56.149> down

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
because that's where it's pushing down

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.280 
because that's where it's pushing down
on<00:01:56.479> top<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:57.650> on<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.040> forth<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.290> that's

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
on top and so on and so forth so that's

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.140 
on top and so on and so forth so that's
basically<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.950> really<00:02:01.490> really<00:02:01.729> cheap

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
you can see there's a little advil cap

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.800 
you can see there's a little advil cap
in<00:02:28.870> there<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:30.519> just<00:02:30.819> keeping<00:02:31.209> pressure<00:02:31.450> on

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
in there it's just keeping pressure on

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
in there it's just keeping pressure on
my<00:02:32.760> water<00:02:33.760> block<00:02:34.030> because<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.420> didn't<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.870> any

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
my water block because I didn't have any

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.490 
my water block because I didn't have any
cross<00:02:36.430> clips<00:02:36.879> that<00:02:37.569> would<00:02:37.750> fit<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.049> right<00:02:38.079> away

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
cross clips that would fit it right away

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.970 
cross clips that would fit it right away
so<00:02:38.620> i<00:02:38.829> just<00:02:39.720> read<00:02:40.720> Matt<00:02:40.930> Greg<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.409> on<00:02:41.620> there

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.949 

so<00:02:45.090> yeah<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.209> heat<00:02:46.329> sink<00:02:46.510> doesn't<00:02:46.720> actually

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
so yeah the heat sink doesn't actually

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.170 
so yeah the heat sink doesn't actually
do<00:02:47.200> anything<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.620> moment<00:02:47.769> hope<00:02:48.730> even<00:02:49.030> hear

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
do anything at the moment hope even hear

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.970 
do anything at the moment hope even hear
the<00:02:49.299> fan<00:02:49.569> kick<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.140> because<00:02:50.379> they<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:50.769> turned

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the fan kick up because they just turned

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.800 
the fan kick up because they just turned
off<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.459> healthier<00:02:52.530> real<00:02:53.530> temp<00:02:53.890> right<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:54.370> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
off the healthier real temp right now is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.920 
off the healthier real temp right now is
33<00:02:55.810> degrees<00:02:57.150> something<00:02:58.150> else<00:02:58.299> I<00:02:58.450> figured<00:02:58.780> out

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
33 degrees something else I figured out

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.550 
33 degrees something else I figured out
if<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.410> run<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> pelt<00:03:00.040> here<00:03:00.430> through<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.030> fan<00:03:01.560> so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
if you run a pelt here through a fan so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.199 
if you run a pelt here through a fan so
here's<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:03.099> positive<00:03:03.549> connection<00:03:04.030> which

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
here's the positive connection which

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.839 
here's the positive connection which
runs<00:03:04.540> through<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.079> fan<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:05.650> then<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
runs through the fan and then to the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.569 
runs through the fan and then to the
positive<00:03:07.030> on<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> pelt<00:03:07.750> here<00:03:08.099> they<00:03:09.099> pull<00:03:09.370> less

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
positive on the pelt here they pull less

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.290 
positive on the pelt here they pull less
amps

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.130 

I<00:03:13.360> can<00:03:14.110> show<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.560> free<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:15.810> ok<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:16.870> you

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
I can show you that free now ok so you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.900 
I can show you that free now ok so you
can<00:03:17.290> see<00:03:17.440> where<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.770> bar<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:20.520> that's<00:03:21.520> on<00:03:21.730> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
can see where the bar is that's on the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.000 
can see where the bar is that's on the
fan

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.059 

okay<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.640> that's<00:03:25.939> on<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.420> fan<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.890> just

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
okay so that's on the fan if I just

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.690 
okay so that's on the fan if I just
touch<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.400> no<00:03:28.790> play<00:03:29.030> her<00:03:29.709> derriere<00:03:30.709> if<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.640> just

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
touch it no play her derriere if I just

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.809 
touch it no play her derriere if I just
touch<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.150> dragged<00:03:36.099> so<00:03:37.099> just<00:03:37.459> running<00:03:37.700> it

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
touch it dragged so just running it

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.619 
touch it dragged so just running it
through<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.000> fan<00:03:38.299> saves<00:03:38.780> me<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.079> few<00:03:39.379> amps<00:03:39.650> and

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
through the fan saves me a few amps and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.360 
through the fan saves me a few amps and
it<00:03:41.629> doesn't<00:03:42.379> really<00:03:42.530> hurt<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.920> temperatures

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
it doesn't really hurt the temperatures

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.880 
it doesn't really hurt the temperatures
at<00:03:43.519> all<00:03:43.659> plus<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:44.870> fan<00:03:45.079> just<00:03:45.379> happens<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.860> be

you<00:04:41.479> just<00:04:41.660> screw<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.080> down<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.410> top<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
you just screw it down on top of the

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.029 
you just screw it down on top of the
water<00:04:43.039> block<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:43.699> holds<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.740> yeah

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
water block and that holds it in so yeah

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.320 
water block and that holds it in so yeah
I<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.280> thought<00:04:46.400> I'd<00:04:46.490> give<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.669> guys<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:46.940> quick

I just thought I'd give you guys a quick
little<00:04:47.570> update<00:04:48.190> I'm<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:49.460> having<00:04:49.729> some<00:04:49.910> fun

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
little update I'm just having some fun

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.650 
little update I'm just having some fun
with<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.449> one<00:04:50.510> point<00:04:50.990> eight<00:04:51.820> it's<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:53.120> dual

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
with this one point eight it's a dual

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.820 
with this one point eight it's a dual
dual<00:04:54.229> core<00:04:54.800> 1.8<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.820> does<00:04:56.000> about<00:04:56.180> 35<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
dual core 1.8 that does about 35 and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.920 
dual core 1.8 that does about 35 and
right<00:04:58.789> now<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.240> doing<00:04:59.660> 12<00:05:00.380> degrees<00:05:00.860> Celsius

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.499 

on<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.310> water-cooled<00:05:05.310> I<00:05:07.070> think<00:05:08.070> it's<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.509> 400

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
on a water-cooled I think it's a 400

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.080 
on a water-cooled I think it's a 400
watt<00:05:09.539> pelt<00:05:09.990> here<00:05:10.250> it's<00:05:11.250> either<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.580> four<00:05:11.910> or

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
watt pelt here it's either a four or

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.409 
watt pelt here it's either a four or
five<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.389> can't<00:05:12.810> remember<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.270> a

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
five I can't remember so it's a

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.719 
five I can't remember so it's a
water-cooled<00:05:15.990> four<00:05:16.350> or<00:05:16.680> five<00:05:17.160> hundred<00:05:17.550> watt

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
water-cooled four or five hundred watt

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.159 
water-cooled four or five hundred watt
saltier<00:05:18.330> can't<00:05:19.020> remember<00:05:19.320> exactly<00:05:20.360> with<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
saltier can't remember exactly with the

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.870 
saltier can't remember exactly with the
temp<00:05:22.470> probe<00:05:23.449> right<00:05:24.449> here<00:05:24.750> as<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.050> can<00:05:25.080> see

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
temp probe right here as you can see

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.969 
temp probe right here as you can see
touching<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.120> actual<00:05:27.570> block<00:05:27.930> or<00:05:28.500> not<00:05:28.860> the

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
touching the actual block or not the

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.430 
touching the actual block or not the
block<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:30.289> touching<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.380> cap<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:32.009> the<00:05:32.270> CPU<00:05:33.440> so

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
block the touching the cap of the CPU so

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.529 
block the touching the cap of the CPU so
that's<00:05:35.100> like<00:05:35.370> pretty<00:05:35.669> well<00:05:35.850> guaranteed<00:05:36.330> what

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
that's like pretty well guaranteed what

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.689 
that's like pretty well guaranteed what
