might go for a very strange strat that
he<00:00:16.430> used<00:00:16.610> against<00:00:17.000> pure<00:00:17.240> but<00:00:17.780> he<00:00:17.869> actually

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
he used against pure but he actually

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.050 
he used against pure but he actually
didn't<00:00:18.530> his<00:00:19.310> game<00:00:19.759> against<00:00:20.060> pure<00:00:20.840> he<00:00:21.740> used<00:00:22.039> a<00:00:22.310> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.710 
at the front of the natural expansion
which<00:00:27.859> worked<00:00:28.130> extremely<00:00:28.550> well<00:00:28.849> on<00:00:29.179> holy

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720

which worked extremely well on holy
world<00:00:29.960> against<00:00:30.380> pure<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:32.480> pretty<00:00:32.630> much

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
world against pure and it's pretty much

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.600 
world against pure and it's pretty much
the<00:00:32.840> same<00:00:33.079> thing<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:33.470> grates<00:00:33.770> gone<00:00:34.070> for<00:00:34.400> a

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
the same thing that grates gone for a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.910 
the same thing that grates gone for a
couple<00:00:34.970> of<00:00:35.180> times<00:00:35.390> on<00:00:35.630> Medusa<00:00:36.170> before<00:00:36.800> they

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
couple of times on Medusa before they

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.320 
couple of times on Medusa before they
change<00:00:37.280> Medusa<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:37.910> stop<00:00:38.120> that<00:00:38.270> from

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
change Medusa to stop that from

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.420 
change Medusa to stop that from
happening<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.500> they<00:00:39.710> might<00:00:39.740> have<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.190> change

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
happening so they might have to change

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.530 
happening so they might have to change
holy<00:00:40.640> world<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:41.000> stop<00:00:41.180> that<00:00:41.330> from<00:00:41.390> happening

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
holy world to stop that from happening

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.080 
holy world to stop that from happening
but<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:42.470> worked<00:00:42.680> out<00:00:42.830> great<00:00:43.100> against<00:00:43.610> pure<00:00:43.820> he

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
but it worked out great against pure he

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.730 
but it worked out great against pure he
never<00:00:44.300> had<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.600> use<00:00:44.630> infested<00:00:45.290> terrans<00:00:45.590> or

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
never had to use infested terrans or

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.590 
never had to use infested terrans or
anything<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.280> he<00:00:46.820> didn't<00:00:47.090> use<00:00:47.180> infested

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
anything and he didn't use infested

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.270 
anything and he didn't use infested
terrans<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.020> last<00:00:48.200> game<00:00:48.410> either<00:00:48.620> does

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
terrans in the last game either does

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.970 
terrans in the last game either does
this<00:00:49.430> very<00:00:49.850> smart<00:00:50.450> plan<00:00:50.750> type<00:00:51.380> B<00:00:51.410> is<00:00:51.650> coming

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
this very smart plan type B is coming

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.370 
this very smart plan type B is coming
with<00:00:52.130> some<00:00:52.310> smart<00:00:52.700> plans<00:00:53.000> today<00:00:53.330> 3<00:00:54.110> 2<00:00:54.800> 1<00:00:55.750> 0<00:00:56.750> so

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
with some smart plans today 3 2 1 0 so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.900 
with some smart plans today 3 2 1 0 so
yeah<00:00:57.560> best<00:00:57.800> will<00:00:58.010> have<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.340> be<00:00:58.430> mindful<00:00:58.700> of

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
yeah best will have to be mindful of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.970 
yeah best will have to be mindful of
that<00:00:59.000> even<00:00:59.780> though<00:00:59.870> he's<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:00.200> a<00:01:00.230> less<00:01:00.560> Zerg

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
that even though he's on a less Zerg

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.840 
that even though he's on a less Zerg
favorite<00:01:01.370> map<00:01:01.580> now<00:01:01.820> outside<00:01:03.250> 03<00:01:04.250> player<00:01:04.549> map

let's<00:01:05.089> get<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.299> colors<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.840> positions<00:01:06.409> over

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
let's get the colors and positions over

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.250 
let's get the colors and positions over
here<00:01:07.040> at<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.490> nine<00:01:07.820> o'clock<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.570> orange<00:01:09.050> is

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
here at the nine o'clock in orange is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.600 
here at the nine o'clock in orange is
tight<00:01:10.040> be<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.860> bloodiest<00:01:13.400> ever<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.490> over<00:01:16.490> at

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
tight be the bloodiest ever and over at

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.880 
tight be the bloodiest ever and over at
the<00:01:16.760> two<00:01:16.970> o'clock<00:01:17.150> position<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.020> teal<00:01:18.560> is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
the two o'clock position and teal is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.170 
the two o'clock position and teal is
best<00:01:20.770> yeah<00:01:21.770> probably<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.430> most<00:01:22.880> viable

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
best yeah probably the most viable

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.360 
best yeah probably the most viable
strata<00:01:23.659> scene<00:01:24.080> for<00:01:24.560> protoss<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.010> go<00:01:25.159> for

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
strata scene for protoss to go for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.780 
strata scene for protoss to go for
against<00:01:25.610> zerg<00:01:25.909> on<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:26.450> map<00:01:26.659> outsider<00:01:27.260> is<00:01:27.790> a

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
against zerg on this map outsider is a

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.660 
against zerg on this map outsider is a
Corsair<00:01:29.390> ever<00:01:29.659> since<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.800> map<00:01:30.980> works<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.520> lot

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
Corsair ever since the map works a lot

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.170 
Corsair ever since the map works a lot
like<00:01:31.730> Andromeda<00:01:32.600> there's<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.229> lot<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:34.180> well

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
like Andromeda there's a lot of well

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.700 
like Andromeda there's a lot of well
it's<00:01:35.330> very<00:01:35.630> hard<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:35.930> get<00:01:36.050> from<00:01:36.320> base<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.530> base

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it's very hard to get from base to base

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.430 
it's very hard to get from base to base
and<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.610> makes<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.000> very<00:01:38.180> mobile<00:01:38.840> air<00:01:39.170> build

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
and that makes a very mobile air build

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.320 
and that makes a very mobile air build
probably<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.130> best<00:01:40.159> strategy<00:01:40.729> for<00:01:40.760> protoss

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
probably the best strategy for protoss

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.410 
probably the best strategy for protoss
to<00:01:41.479> go<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.909> it's<00:01:43.909> pretty<00:01:44.060> much<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.240> best

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
to go for and it's pretty much the best

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.000 
to go for and it's pretty much the best
strategy<00:01:44.810> for<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:45.020> zerk<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.440> go<00:01:45.590> for<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.920> as

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
strategy for a zerk to go for you as

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.250 
strategy for a zerk to go for you as
well<00:01:46.159> guardians<00:01:46.850> work<00:01:47.120> very<00:01:47.690> well<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.930> this

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
well guardians work very well on this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.730 
well guardians work very well on this
map<00:01:49.240> but<00:01:50.240> if<00:01:50.420> best<00:01:50.690> goes<00:01:50.900> for<00:01:51.140> Corsair<00:01:51.470> river

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
map but if best goes for Corsair river

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.719 
map but if best goes for Corsair river
Guardians<00:01:52.070> going<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.340> be<00:01:52.400> pretty<00:01:52.549> much

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
Guardians going to be pretty much

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.510 
Guardians going to be pretty much
useless<00:01:52.940> I've<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.229> most<00:01:54.409> notable<00:01:54.799> example<00:01:55.280> of

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
useless I've the most notable example of

building that's coming down fast playing

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.589 
building that's coming down fast playing
is<00:03:54.470> say<00:03:54.590> putting<00:03:54.889> down<00:03:55.040> two<00:03:55.400> cannons<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.030> now

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
is say putting down two cannons and now

is say putting down two cannons and now
his<00:03:56.870> nexus<00:03:57.349> so<00:03:57.859> he<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.069> going<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.669> forge<00:03:58.940> fast

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
his nexus so he is going to forge fast

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.939 
his nexus so he is going to forge fast
expand<00:03:59.510> their<00:03:59.690> getting<00:03:59.989> surrounded<00:04:00.199> by<00:04:00.709> type

beat ib takes down the scout so best is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.050 
beat ib takes down the scout so best is
going<00:04:03.859> to<00:04:03.949> have<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.129> send<00:04:04.280> out<00:04:04.459> another<00:04:04.699> probe

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
going to have to send out another probe

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.750 
going to have to send out another probe
to<00:04:05.989> see<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.859> next<00:04:07.040> building<00:04:07.340> that's<00:04:07.519> coming

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
to see the next building that's coming

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.319 
to see the next building that's coming
up<00:04:07.819> here<00:04:08.620> looks<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.799> he<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.120> sending<00:04:11.120> out

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
up here looks like he is sending out

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.939 
up here looks like he is sending out
that<00:04:11.510> probe<00:04:11.750> right<00:04:11.989> now<00:04:12.199> he's<00:04:12.530> going<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.799> try

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
that probe right now he's going to try

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.099 
that probe right now he's going to try
to<00:04:12.980> sneak<00:04:13.250> past<00:04:13.489> those<00:04:13.729> circlings<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:15.079> oh

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
to sneak past those circlings but oh

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.629 
to sneak past those circlings but oh
maybe<00:04:15.409> not<00:04:15.620> he<00:04:15.680> put<00:04:15.829> down<00:04:15.919> his<00:04:15.979> gateway<00:04:16.370> and

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
maybe not he put down his gateway and

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.909 
maybe not he put down his gateway and
he's<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.380> start<00:04:18.380> mining<00:04:18.620> at<00:04:18.799> his

he's going to start mining at his

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.129 
he's going to start mining at his
natural<00:04:19.280> expansion<00:04:19.549> here<00:04:19.909> soon<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.419> see<00:04:20.989> what

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
natural expansion here soon I see what

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.629 
natural expansion here soon I see what
he's<00:04:21.229> doing<00:04:21.530> he's<00:04:21.709> going<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.039> try<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.310> sneak

minerals and get into the main and tight

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.980 
minerals and get into the main and tight
B<00:04:28.729> is<00:04:28.849> actually<00:04:29.210> ready<00:04:29.450> for<00:04:29.659> this<00:04:29.750> he's

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
B is actually ready for this he's

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.119 
B is actually ready for this he's
scouting

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
scouting

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.979

the mineral lines next to his bases

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:35.559 
the mineral lines next to his bases
without<00:04:33.229> circlings<00:04:33.919> here<00:04:34.219> so<00:04:34.969> type<00:04:35.239> B<00:04:35.419> is

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
without circlings here so type B is

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.209 
without circlings here so type B is
really<00:04:35.929> on<00:04:36.050> top<00:04:36.229> of<00:04:36.289> his<00:04:36.559> game<00:04:36.619> here<00:04:37.069> has

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
really on top of his game here has

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.369 
really on top of his game here has
really<00:04:37.429> impressed<00:04:37.789> me<00:04:37.939> so<00:04:37.999> far<00:04:38.389> even<00:04:39.289> though

I've just seen play a few games today he
sees<00:04:42.019> the<00:04:42.409> probe<00:04:43.279> coming<00:04:43.550> out<00:04:43.639> here<00:04:43.789> oh<00:04:43.819> I

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 
sees the probe coming out here oh I

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.009 
sees the probe coming out here oh I
don't<00:04:44.089> think<00:04:44.269> he<00:04:44.449> was<00:04:44.539> quite<00:04:44.749> paying

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:45.019

was going to say that was going to be

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
was going to say that was going to be
close<00:04:58.789> and<00:04:59.029> band<00:04:59.509> that<00:04:59.749> was<00:04:59.899> close<00:05:00.459> and

close and band that was close and

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.669 
close and band that was close and
another<00:05:02.479> hatchery<00:05:02.899> coming<00:05:03.199> down<00:05:03.319> here<00:05:03.529> so

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:03.679 
another hatchery coming down here so

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:05.379 
another hatchery coming down here so
best<00:05:03.889> is<00:05:04.039> completely<00:05:04.669> in<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:04.819> dark<00:05:04.939> right<00:05:05.330> now

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
best is completely in the dark right now

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.600 
best is completely in the dark right now
he's<00:05:06.110> going<00:05:06.319> to<00:05:06.409> have<00:05:06.499> to<00:05:06.559> play<00:05:06.769> it<00:05:06.979> super<00:05:07.339> safe

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
he's going to have to play it super safe

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.339 
he's going to have to play it super safe
here<00:05:07.849> maybe<00:05:08.119> put<00:05:08.360> down<00:05:08.509> a<00:05:08.539> couple<00:05:08.779> of<00:05:08.929> cannons

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
here maybe put down a couple of cannons

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.559 
here maybe put down a couple of cannons
at<00:05:09.679> each<00:05:10.099> base<00:05:10.399> right<00:05:10.699> now<00:05:10.879> because<00:05:11.240> he<00:05:11.389> does

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
at each base right now because he does

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.469 
at each base right now because he does
not<00:05:11.599> know<00:05:12.169> what's<00:05:12.709> coming<00:05:13.039> his<00:05:13.159> way<00:05:13.339> and<00:05:14.149> the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
not know what's coming his way and the

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.499 
not know what's coming his way and the
type<00:05:14.839> B<00:05:15.050> is<00:05:15.229> very<00:05:16.069> much<00:05:16.309> on<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:17.269> defensive

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
type B is very much on the defensive

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.119 
type B is very much on the defensive
right<00:05:18.110> now<00:05:18.259> with<00:05:18.409> these<00:05:18.529> circlings<00:05:18.979> he's

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
right now with these circlings he's

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.189 
right now with these circlings he's
going<00:05:19.339> to<00:05:19.429> stop<00:05:19.699> probes<00:05:20.089> from<00:05:20.209> coming<00:05:20.569> in<00:05:20.689> for

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
going to stop probes from coming in for

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.239 
going to stop probes from coming in for
a<00:05:21.229> long<00:05:21.409> time<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.769> think<00:05:23.800> best<00:05:24.800> putting<00:05:25.129> down

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:25.249 
a long time I think best putting down

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.219 
a long time I think best putting down
cybernetics<00:05:25.849> core<00:05:26.089> tight<00:05:26.659> bees<00:05:26.839> getting<00:05:27.139> the

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
cybernetics core tight bees getting the

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.019 
cybernetics core tight bees getting the
full<00:05:27.409> scout<00:05:27.649> on<00:05:27.800> best<00:05:27.979> right<00:05:28.189> now<00:05:28.219> so<00:05:28.909> he's

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
full scout on best right now so he's

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.309 
full scout on best right now so he's
going<00:05:29.209> to<00:05:29.269> know<00:05:29.419> if<00:05:29.539> best<00:05:29.749> is<00:05:29.899> going<00:05:30.110> for

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
going to know if best is going for

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.069 
going to know if best is going for
stargate<00:05:30.860> maybe<00:05:31.099> to<00:05:31.369> stargates<00:05:32.079> very

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:33.079 
stargate maybe to stargates very

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:35.589 
stargate maybe to stargates very
indicative<00:05:33.529> of<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:34.189> corset<00:05:34.849> rebuilt<00:05:35.209> oh<00:05:35.329> it

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
indicative of a corset rebuilt oh it

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:36.879 
indicative of a corset rebuilt oh it
looks<00:05:35.749> like<00:05:35.869> best<00:05:36.079> coming<00:05:36.409> in<00:05:36.529> he<00:05:36.679> might

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
looks like best coming in he might

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.319 
looks like best coming in he might
finally<00:05:37.189> get<00:05:37.429> the<00:05:37.550> scout<00:05:37.789> on<00:05:37.909> next<00:05:38.119> building

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:38.329 
finally get the scout on next building

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.480 
finally get the scout on next building
coming<00:05:38.599> out<00:05:38.659> but<00:05:38.809> no<00:05:38.959> type<00:05:39.319> be<00:05:39.559> denying<00:05:40.309> the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
coming out but no type be denying the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.559 
coming out but no type be denying the
scout<00:05:40.729> even<00:05:41.360> longer<00:05:41.599> here<00:05:43.149> well<00:05:44.149> he<00:05:44.300> probably

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
scout even longer here well he probably

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.290 
scout even longer here well he probably
has<00:05:44.959> his<00:05:45.889> building<00:05:46.369> warping<00:05:46.729> in<00:05:46.849> inside<00:05:47.209> of

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
has his building warping in inside of

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.790 
has his building warping in inside of
his<00:05:47.419> main<00:05:47.599> right<00:05:47.809> now<00:05:47.959> whatever<00:05:48.139> it<00:05:48.439> is<00:05:48.559> either

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
his main right now whatever it is either

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.519 
his main right now whatever it is either
spiral<00:05:49.339> or<00:05:49.429> hydrolyse<00:05:49.939> den<00:05:50.240> didn't<00:05:51.079> quite<00:05:51.259> get

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:51.529 
spiral or hydrolyse den didn't quite get

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.429 
spiral or hydrolyse den didn't quite get
the<00:05:51.860> full<00:05:52.399> sight<00:05:53.389> of<00:05:53.599> that<00:05:53.629> but<00:05:54.110> yeah<00:05:54.259> the

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
the full sight of that but yeah the

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.409 
the full sight of that but yeah the
Stargate<00:05:54.769> coming<00:05:55.039> up<00:05:55.129> now<00:05:55.279> for<00:05:55.339> Best<00:05:55.999> so<00:05:56.300> he's

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
Stargate coming up now for Best so he's

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.929 
Stargate coming up now for Best so he's
going<00:05:56.569> to<00:05:56.659> get<00:05:56.809> asked<00:05:56.990> out<00:05:57.050> eventually<00:05:57.939> that's

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
going to get asked out eventually that's

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.029 
going to get asked out eventually that's
pretty<00:05:59.419> much<00:05:59.539> what<00:05:59.929> the<00:06:00.139> initial<00:06:00.559> corsair<00:06:00.949> is

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
pretty much what the initial corsair is

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.980 
pretty much what the initial corsair is
best<00:06:01.309> for<00:06:01.550> getting<00:06:01.999> the<00:06:02.149> full<00:06:02.449> scout<00:06:02.779> on

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
best for getting the full scout on

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.389 
best for getting the full scout on
everything<00:06:03.589> that's<00:06:03.619> why<00:06:03.889> you<00:06:03.949> see<00:06:04.189> the

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:04.399 
everything that's why you see the

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.389 
everything that's why you see the
Corsairs<00:06:05.199> not<00:06:06.199> attacking<00:06:06.709> overlords<00:06:07.189> at<00:06:07.309> the

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:07.399 
Corsairs not attacking overlords at the

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.619 
Corsairs not attacking overlords at the
beginning<00:06:07.789> looks<00:06:08.269> like<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.509> spire<00:06:08.749> coming<00:06:09.079> up

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
beginning looks like the spire coming up

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.749 
beginning looks like the spire coming up
so<00:06:11.629> this<00:06:11.959> is<00:06:11.990> probably<00:06:12.409> going<00:06:12.919> to<00:06:13.039> transition

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
so this is probably going to transition

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.759 
so this is probably going to transition
into<00:06:14.029> a<00:06:14.209> hydrolysed<00:06:14.809> build<00:06:14.990> i<00:06:15.110> think<00:06:15.349> i<00:06:15.529> think

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:15.769 
into a hydrolysed build i think i think

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:17.529 
into a hydrolysed build i think i think
the<00:06:15.860> spire<00:06:16.099> is<00:06:16.249> just<00:06:16.459> for<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.639> scourge<00:06:17.300> this

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
the spire is just for a scourge this

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.619 
the spire is just for a scourge this
time<00:06:18.249> joy<00:06:19.249> to<00:06:19.429> try<00:06:19.579> to<00:06:19.639> come<00:06:19.849> in<00:06:19.999> end<00:06:20.269> it<00:06:20.509> with

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.629 
time joy to try to come in end it with

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.569 
time joy to try to come in end it with
scourge<00:06:20.990> and<00:06:23.079> tight<00:06:24.079> be<00:06:24.289> I<00:06:24.589> think<00:06:24.919> tight<00:06:25.399> be

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:25.579 
scourge and tight be I think tight be

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:27.100 
scourge and tight be I think tight be
put<00:06:25.819> down<00:06:25.939> another<00:06:26.119> base<00:06:26.509> up<00:06:26.749> there<00:06:26.869> at

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
put down another base up there at

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.709 
put down another base up there at
another<00:06:27.529> mineral<00:06:27.919> only<00:06:28.219> and<00:06:28.579> if<00:06:29.179> he<00:06:29.329> has<00:06:29.509> this

another mineral only and if he has this

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:32.409 
another mineral only and if he has this
many<00:06:29.959> mineral<00:06:30.349> only<00:06:30.619> is<00:06:30.679> going<00:06:31.119> he's<00:06:32.119> probably

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
many mineral only is going he's probably

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.589 
many mineral only is going he's probably
yet<00:06:32.839> don't<00:06:33.139> going<00:06:33.469> for<00:06:33.619> a<00:06:33.649> hydro<00:06:33.979> build<00:06:34.339> here
