00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.690
 welcome to the jacks corner in this 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.000
 good time let's talk about the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.580
 cassette that from doing here and you 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.199
 I'm going to explain how to be able to be 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.510
 as many times as you want and 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.970
 for free I do that is the best 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.220
 in principle, well, I looked for 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.369
 internet so somewhere where I put it 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.160
 not found nor videos of guides or anything 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.109
 so good I'll share it with 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.030
 you and I guess it will be the first 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.249
 this will make a thousand videos too 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.039
 explaining this same but good there 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:44.049
 I am the first a pioneer then 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.510
 Well, I will explain that this set 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.850
 it is a collector's set so 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.399
 So, you know this, this is for 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.989
 do nice is not equipped from 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.690
 level 1 so good any 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.479
 new character can look this being not 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.399
 nothing level and good one of the 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.649
 curiosities is that it has the chila bed 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.360
 which is one of the few backpacks that do not give 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.580
 not a single power 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.530
 that the two critical hits five of your 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.810
 special and general damages but nothing 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.460
 post anything because we are chila then 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.970
 Well, many people have asked 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.580
 this same how you get the set is 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.979
 say what the conditions are and how 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.900
 then he came out as good to start 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.240
 explain that this the first time 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.030
 they delivered it was in the bed that 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.600
 they convince not the one of france the reason was 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.370
 in utopia and well there as a prize one of 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.300
 the things that is delivered to the players 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.700
 of dofus since they were little cards does not derogate 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.470
 master not then then well this was 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.770
 the first time the cassette was delivered 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 after this because there was an event 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.590
 what good is this here not which 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.530
 you had to look for some of the clues 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.100
 do not want to be here, and when 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.170
 united all the tracks very map then 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.110
 you end up having a date that is not 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.050
 being here is not painted because it was 17 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 from the 2014 sil 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.890
 from here that day just that day 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.660
 Well, this image was published which 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.730
 good in schramm build one of the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.460
 figures had a note you had to 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.190
 find it and apply on it then you 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.560
 they gave code to use it only 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.290
 I could use during that day then 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.360
 these were the ways to get the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.990
 camp do not after this well then 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.150
 there were no more ways and no good 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.040
 explain the new way 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.000
 as you know well there are many people 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.510
 that has youtube channels and little things 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.129
 well and promote the products of others 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.220
 companies in this case then we have 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.620
 ankama what good to other people 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.439
 does an advertising campaign of these 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.329
 people ask you to believe a 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.340
 account to make a place of things 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.950
 well and good when you can win 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.530
 many players then for that they create 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.810
 this type of pages just like it is 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.629
 good is this one in particular in which 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.750
 be able to create an account then you 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.030
 give the beds and obviously as you see 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.040
 is from the page of hamas is covered point 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.950
 what is contact both networks wan or 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.500
 is a reliable page is not pool of 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.439
 this and obviously this works 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.959
 creating an account is to say if you 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.359
 you create a thousand accounts then a thousand beds is that 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.439
 you will have if you create one as one that 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.510
 you will have the idea because it is the basis for you 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.159
 personally and then two months you would 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.240
 transfer to your account because they are not 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.070
 linked 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.010
 but you have to wait two months 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.600
 to be exchanged then to 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150
 long term can be a business for 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.160
 those who want to sell mcewan between 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.010
 the hat or the backpack and all this 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.590
 you can take out practically has 200,000 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.560
 expenses not to do then then 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.340
 You see here you have to create an account 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.170
 password e mail 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.050
 you can invent everything is more I go to 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.290
 create a right now it will be called 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.590
 I know about inta 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.040
 Appetite because the appetite also gives me 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.040
 all right 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.700
 so I like what I'll do because if not 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.700
 then I remember 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:25.770
 I'll put a uninet password will be 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.770
 manolo and this new way 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.760
 I invented it and this is not my email 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:38.180
 much less the court by 26-31 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.130
 We accept the information and that 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.610
 this gentleman then they send him information 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.310
 then we register and as you see 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.200
 now it will tell us that we have already created 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.660
 our account of the just ritual and 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.880
 pasqua does not take us a little bit in the 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.800
 Internet verse I guess but good 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.380
 here we have already created an account 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.170
 he says it in Portuguese is in the one 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.700
 so now we're going to the 2 as 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.890
 You see, well, he just wrote there 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.190
 password to not forget me and that I do not know 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.990
 show all 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.670
 although those things are told and good 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.090
 I put the password then now 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.919
 does not tell us when 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.230
 the nickname that will be and is cut for example 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.920
 exists 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.900
 is to cut 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.270
 one 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.540
 it exists but as it is not valid then 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.540
 nothing 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.280
 is assigned 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.230
 then here we already chose the server 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.240
 where we play, well, in my case, whether 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.820
 of this game nothing else so I'm leaving 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.830
 for soul we create a character that 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.070
 we please if I wanted a name 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.139
 random 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:53.009
 well in estella I'm doing well 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.520
 and as you see now this you connect 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:59.759
 to the character mode and nothing else to start 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.819
 Well you'll have tubes so we passed the 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:05.999
 video we pass this and here we see that 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:09.150
 we have the bed be ready to be able 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:12.419
 using it is obvious that well this I will accept 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.430
 everything now we do not know about the tutorial and 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.039
 As you can see, well, I have the set here 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.659
 which will be interchangeable then two here 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.419
 months or is it a little but good 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.090
 those who really like what 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.219
 is to collect sets and have not had the 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.949
 opportunity to get this well 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.810
 sure they will appreciate it and those who 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.610
 go for the business, well, good

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.990
 term but just as well and good to
