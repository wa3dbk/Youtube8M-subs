galaxy<00:00:16.049> s3<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.730> made<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> mistake<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.830> getting

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
galaxy s3 I made the mistake of getting

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340 
galaxy s3 I made the mistake of getting
the<00:00:20.130> white<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.359> all<00:00:21.869> personal

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the white one which is all personal

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710 
the white one which is all personal
preference<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.699> me<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> mistake

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
preference but to me it was a mistake

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.769 
preference but to me it was a mistake
because<00:00:25.369> when<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> white<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:26.849> one

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
because when you get the white one one

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.480 
because when you get the white one one
is<00:00:28.109> hard<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> find<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> case<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.310> rock

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
is hard to find the case to rock

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.900 
is hard to find the case to rock

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
seidio active case and protection wise

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.260 
seidio active case and protection wise
is<00:02:15.190> great<00:02:16.770> looks<00:02:17.770> wise<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.400> me<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.790> black<00:02:19.030> in

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270

the<00:02:19.360> white<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.220> not<00:02:21.460> working<00:02:22.270> for<00:02:22.300> me

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
the white it just is not working for me

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.290 
the white it just is not working for me
like<00:02:23.710> it<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:25.710> maybe<00:02:26.820> there's<00:02:27.820> another<00:02:27.910> case

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
like it is maybe there's another case

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.100 
like it is maybe there's another case
that<00:02:28.330> one<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.920> TPU<00:02:30.400> case<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.450> has<00:02:31.630> black

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that one that is a TPU case it has black

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.750 
that one that is a TPU case it has black
edges<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.800> then<00:02:33.490> clear<00:02:34.390> back<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.640> think

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
edges and then clear back it's I think

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.070 
edges and then clear back it's I think
it's<00:02:37.030> called<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:38.520> no<00:02:39.520> sim<00:02:39.820> or<00:02:40.030> sonam<00:02:40.570> whatever

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
it's called a no sim or sonam whatever

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.520 
it's called a no sim or sonam whatever
