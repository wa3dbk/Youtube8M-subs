and let me just find the power button on
this<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.540> now<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.250> IPS

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this so right now there it's an IPS

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.250 
this so right now there it's an IPS
panels<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> viewing<00:00:45.629> angles<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:45.960> not

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
panels but the viewing angles are not

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
panels but the viewing angles are not
the<00:00:46.410> best<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> decent

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the best but actually it's a decent

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.260 
the best but actually it's a decent
panel<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> brightness<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.660> totally<00:00:48.899> okay

there's<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.520> gig<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> ram<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> 8<00:00:54.270> gigs<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there's one gig of ram and 8 gigs of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400 
there's one gig of ram and 8 gigs of
flash<00:00:54.809> memory

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
flash memory

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.080 
flash memory
they're<00:00:55.620> supposed<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.219> 1.2<00:00:56.789> gigahertz

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
they're supposed to be 1.2 gigahertz

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
they're supposed to be 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core<00:00:57.690> chip<00:00:58.199> from<00:00:58.350> rock<00:00:58.530> chip<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
dual-core chip from rock chip in there

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.299 
dual-core chip from rock chip in there
so<00:01:00.020> performance<00:01:01.020> should<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.620> pretty<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.070> all

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
so performance should be pretty much all

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
so performance should be pretty much all
right<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> best<00:01:03.090> CPU<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.809> since

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
right it's not the best CPU but since

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.200 
right it's not the best CPU but since
it's<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> kids<00:01:04.739> orientated<00:01:05.400> tablet<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it's the kids orientated tablet that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
it's the kids orientated tablet that
shouldn't<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.659> matter<00:01:08.060> they're<00:01:09.060> putting

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
shouldn't really matter they're putting

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.890 
shouldn't really matter they're putting
on<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> bunch<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.290> kids<00:01:11.420> orientated<00:01:12.420> apps<00:01:12.600> so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
on a bunch of kids orientated apps so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
on a bunch of kids orientated apps so
they<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.439> Kids<00:01:14.280> Zone<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
doesn't require an inner connection so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.300 
doesn't require an inner connection so
that<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.290> not<00:01:18.470> available<00:01:18.830> right<00:01:18.860> now<00:01:19.100> right

down here on the other side there's

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.730 
down here on the other side there's
pretty<00:02:04.479> much<00:02:04.540> nothing<00:02:04.780> because<00:02:05.229> they've<00:02:05.409> all

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
pretty much nothing because they've all

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.609

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
would guess might be even lower or just

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.350 
would guess might be even lower or just
the<00:02:14.050> VGA<00:02:14.350> resolution<00:02:14.640> since<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:15.850> just<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.180> kid

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360

one<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.880> don't<00:03:25.940> know<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.390> resolution<00:03:27.110> on<00:03:27.380> this

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
one I don't know the resolution on this

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.750 
one I don't know the resolution on this
since<00:03:27.830> they<00:03:27.950> couldn't<00:03:28.130> give<00:03:28.340> us<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.519> spec<00:03:28.730> sheet

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
since they couldn't give us a spec sheet
