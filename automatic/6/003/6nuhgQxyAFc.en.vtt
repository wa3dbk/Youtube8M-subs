you<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.750> perfect<00:02:20.989> returns<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:21.950> got

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
you the perfect returns because we got

three points and and it's a derby and I
think<00:02:26.989> we've<00:02:27.140> beaten<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:28.010> very<00:02:28.880> very<00:02:29.450> difficult

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
think we've beaten a very very difficult

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.890 
think we've beaten a very very difficult
team<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:31.489> play<00:02:31.700> against<00:02:32.000> because<00:02:32.720> they're

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
team to play against because they're

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.170 
team to play against because they're
good<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.480> probably<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:37.070> first<00:02:37.280> call<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.090> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
good and probably the first call in the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.760 
good and probably the first call in the
first<00:02:38.420> half<00:02:38.630> helped<00:02:38.840> us<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.200> lot<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.380> it

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
first half helped us a lot because it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.080 
first half helped us a lot because it
brought<00:02:40.190> confidence<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.030> team<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.630 
brought confidence to the team and it
was<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.690> two<00:02:44.870> goals<00:02:45.110> which<00:02:45.320> go<00:02:45.500> at<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.430> end<00:02:46.459> of
