 of course it's a smaller copy of that 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.339
 food but the structure of the city architecture 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.230
 so many places it all reminds of 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.879
 that you saw in the game but this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.989
 parking was an idiot mission with 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:54.370
 rc helicopter this 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.350
 the most important thing here is not to fall 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.300
 casually into gaming nostalgia 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.940

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:13.810
 Russian men and crouched the other end of the ball 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.120
 winter work and life and a piece of the beach there 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.480
 such a term to test and not from 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.370

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.930
 There is a lot of money here 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 tattoo salons are almost as many as 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.360
 grocery stores and before my life 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.920

 Jesus does not just shine into the void I find 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.970
 I have an emptiness on my chest and center 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.049
 small meters which lowered drove 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:12.989
 completely free you can sit on 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:14.370
 day I got hooked on a sport that 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.730
 called us absolutely terrible 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.480
 way 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.760
 american football just americans 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.090
 football that of course fill one volume 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.470
 that the game on both groans often fall 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.840
 arms 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 What bonuses does this sport have for the first time ? 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 crazy spectacular men and wearing a hard hat 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.959
 those you want to like the ancient 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.549
 breasts react on each other 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.549
 This simple view is a very spectacular sight. 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.000
 soaring in principle the rule is very 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.579
 clear asking them from a friend or 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.150
 read and see fast enough 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.799
 leave 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.220
 start to understand what's going on 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:03.530
 field but unlike the European 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.530
 option for super who came 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.349
 protecting you with your hands forward a couple of battles 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.690
 shorter puppy result turned out 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.400
 cool sport with quite understandable 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.860
 team mechanics started watching 1 / 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.860
 between the teams end of the ring and chess 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.269
 word of the year according to oxford 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.910
 dictionary links 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.819

 urban pieces and elongated island 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.110
 which is called miami beach proper 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.489
 here to this hour and located in 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.080
 Miami Beach looks like such a Alushta 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.450
 which has suddenly become very popular 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.489
 many bars of hotel restaurants and bars 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.200
 all that we used to see in the sea, yes 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.629
 overall it looked all not to say what 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.500
 super snobbish never different at all 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:00.380
 equally cool catch jagged troll 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.810

 lucky who lens flooded the rain 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.360
 mine between normal streets 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.310
 There are such sticks and I am very 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.690
 scary though even during the day when I 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.400
 there will be as much as this 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.520
 dude want to do so too read 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.889
 a little book 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.150
 me in a cafe class you actually that 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.620
 required to prove in each 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.379
 more or less large American city 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.690
 There is a business district with a skyscraper. 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.580
 depending on the size and business read these 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.190
 cities respectively different size 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.710
 this networks and in each there is an art you and 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.509
 areas where any tips to the hang out 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.610
 all smeared with graffiti it reminds 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.069
 apartment planning should be 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.900
 the cabinet that the kitchen should be 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.900
 living room and the main thing in two toilets 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:11.699
 several frames by the number of day it 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.860
 cuts I have forgotten how to Russian 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.590
 talking seems to sit in clothes 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.050
 in front of the ocean and not climb the water very 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.080
 accurate metaphors in general to our life me 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.840
 it seems like cool water should 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.909
 be warm so reluctant and change them 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.340
 current stable shoes 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:33.139
 shoot the girls somehow no one especially 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.139
