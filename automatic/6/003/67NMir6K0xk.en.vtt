new videos every day by now you've
probably<00:00:03.570> seen<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.200> add-on<00:00:04.560> high-fructose

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950

corn<00:00:05.339> syrup<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:06.299> fact<00:00:06.509> I've<00:00:06.660> talked<00:00:07.170> about

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
corn syrup in fact I've talked about

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.379 
corn syrup in fact I've talked about
high<00:00:07.680> fructose<00:00:07.890> corn<00:00:08.069> syrup<00:00:08.340> before<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.179> I

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
high fructose corn syrup before and I

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.299 
high fructose corn syrup before and I
can<00:00:09.960> actually<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.349> little<00:00:10.620> response<00:00:10.980> from

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
can actually got a little response from

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.430 
can actually got a little response from
the<00:00:11.490> other<00:00:11.759> corn<00:00:12.120> industry<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.259> just

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the other corn industry and I just

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440 
the other corn industry and I just
wanted<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> share<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.219> things<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.360> all

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
wanted to share some things first of all

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.390 
wanted to share some things first of all
I<00:00:15.480> want<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> dress<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.170> ad<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.980> think

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I want to dress that ad it's I think

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.980 
I want to dress that ad it's I think
it's<00:00:17.520> misleading<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.270> I'm<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.600> gonna<00:00:18.750> say

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
it's misleading so I'm just gonna say

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.820 
it's misleading so I'm just gonna say
that<00:00:19.039> but<00:00:20.449> in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> ad<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:22.020> say<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.560> high

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
that but in the ad they say that high

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.529 
that but in the ad they say that high
fructose<00:00:23.039> corn<00:00:23.220> syrup<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.850> made<00:00:23.880> from<00:00:24.240> corn

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.620 
fructose corn syrup is made from corn
that's<00:00:25.230> true<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> lot<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.390> things

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that's true but there is a lot of things

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
that's true but there is a lot of things
that<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.529> made<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:29.130> some<00:00:29.460> natural

that are made from some natural

they're<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.189> good<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.399> us<00:00:32.610> high<00:00:33.570> fructose

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

a natural substance it doesn't occur in
nature<00:00:38.760> you're<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> find<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
nature you're not going to find it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
nature you're not going to find it
anywhere<00:00:40.649> until<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.460> run<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.730> through<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> lab

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
anywhere until you run it through a lab

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
anywhere until you run it through a lab
ok<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.559> even<00:00:43.800> though<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.040> made<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.430> corn

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
ok so even though it's made from corn

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.010 
ok so even though it's made from corn
that's<00:00:45.420> true

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that's true

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.630 
that's true
it<00:00:46.469> doesn't<00:00:46.829> necessarily<00:00:47.250> mean<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.520> good

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it doesn't necessarily mean it's good

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
it doesn't necessarily mean it's good
for<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.920> doesn't<00:00:50.129> have

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
for you all right now it doesn't have

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.729 
for you all right now it doesn't have
any<00:00:50.489> artificial<00:00:50.820> ingredients<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
any artificial ingredients you know I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
any artificial ingredients you know I
don't<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.789> true<00:00:53.969> statement

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
don't think that's a true statement

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
don't think that's a true statement
because<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> itself<00:00:55.710> an<00:00:55.980> artificial

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
because it is itself an artificial

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.330 
because it is itself an artificial

to find chute sucrose in nature it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.789 
to find chute sucrose in nature it's
refined<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.830> beets<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:06.060> sugar<00:01:06.720> cane<00:01:06.810> but

refined from beets or sugar cane but

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.039

it's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> natural<00:01:08.729> substance<00:01:09.090> it's

it's not a natural substance it's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.359 
it's not a natural substance it's

it's<00:01:52.590> outrageous<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.490> much<00:01:53.670> we're<00:01:53.850> taking<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it's outrageous how much we're taking it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.120 
it's outrageous how much we're taking it
do<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.439> sugar<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.979> take

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
do you know how much sugar you can take

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.600 
do you know how much sugar you can take
in<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> drink<00:01:56.750> sodas<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.189> highest<00:01:59.189> caloric

do<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.820> how<00:02:03.090> much<00:02:03.299> sweeteners<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
do you know how much sweeteners and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.310 
do you know how much sweeteners and
those<00:02:04.049> things<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> most<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> sweetener

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
those things so most of the sweetener

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.990 
those things so most of the sweetener
used<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.950> high<00:02:08.160> fructose<00:02:08.399> corn<00:02:08.640> syrup

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
used now is high fructose corn syrup

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
used now is high fructose corn syrup

okay<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.890> American<00:03:39.190> Medical<00:03:39.400> Association

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
okay the American Medical Association

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.460 
okay the American Medical Association
now<00:03:40.239> says<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.720> high<00:03:40.810> fructose<00:03:41.019> corn<00:03:41.200> syrup

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
now says that high fructose corn syrup

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.970 
now says that high fructose corn syrup
is<00:03:41.829> safe<00:03:42.040> what<00:03:42.940> does<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.060> mean<00:03:43.920> several<00:03:44.920> of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
is safe what does that mean several of

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.979 
is safe what does that mean several of
the<00:03:45.070> studies<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.459> they've<00:03:46.180> been<00:03:46.510> involved

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
the studies that they've been involved

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.740 
the studies that they've been involved
in<00:03:47.110> say<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:47.769> not<00:03:47.950> if<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:49.030> read<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.390> studies

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
in say it's not if you read the studies

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.110 
in say it's not if you read the studies
if<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.440> really<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.190> PubMed<00:03:51.670> there's<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.940> lot

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
if you really go to PubMed there's a lot

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.729 
if you really go to PubMed there's a lot
of<00:03:52.239> places<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.570> can<00:03:52.660> go<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.320> look<00:03:53.590> up

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
of places you can go you can look up

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.080 
of places you can go you can look up
studies<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.310> there<00:03:54.700> are<00:03:54.790> more<00:03:54.940> negative

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
studies and there are more negative

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.210

studies<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.690> positive<00:03:56.110> studies<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.070> we've

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
studies and positive studies so we've

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.750 
studies and positive studies so we've
got<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.489> consider<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.769> ma<00:03:59.769> is<00:04:00.100> probably<00:04:00.640> not

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
got to consider that ma is probably not

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.400 
got to consider that ma is probably not
the<00:04:00.880> best<00:04:00.910> thing<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.299> consider<00:04:01.570> for<00:04:01.959> approval

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
the best thing to consider for approval

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.740 
the best thing to consider for approval
they<00:04:03.100> approve<00:04:03.489> some<00:04:03.640> things<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.390> maybe

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
they approve some things that that maybe

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.780 
they approve some things that that maybe
aren't<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.110> healthy<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.680> don't<00:04:06.549> know<00:04:06.640> what

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
aren't that healthy I don't know what

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.949 
aren't that healthy I don't know what
the<00:04:06.910> money<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.269> either<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:09.579> careful<00:04:10.030> in

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
the money is either so be careful in

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.370 
the money is either so be careful in
just<00:04:11.650> buying<00:04:12.250> something<00:04:12.609> because<00:04:13.170> it's<00:04:14.170> got

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
just buying something because it's got

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.469 
just buying something because it's got
that<00:04:14.590> stamp<00:04:14.890> of<00:04:15.040> approval

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
that stamp of approval

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.080 
that stamp of approval
they<00:04:16.479> say<00:04:16.690> research<00:04:17.079> confirms<00:04:17.620> that

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
they say research confirms that

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.330 
they say research confirms that
hypersurface<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.660> just<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.440> safest<00:04:20.829> sugar<00:04:21.039> well

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
hypersurface is just a safest sugar well

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.680 
hypersurface is just a safest sugar well
yeah<00:04:22.740> what<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:23.830> call<00:04:24.039> sugar<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.610> not<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.419> safe

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
yeah what we call sugar is not a safe

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.820 
yeah what we call sugar is not a safe
thing<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.930> eat<00:04:26.110> eat<00:04:26.260> it

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
thing to eat eat it

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.580

I mean I don't want to fight with the

people who make table sugar but it's not

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.230 
people who make table sugar but it's not
