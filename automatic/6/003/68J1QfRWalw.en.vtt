00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.800 
fundamentals and we have to run it down
their<00:01:47.319> throat<00:01:47.560> that's<00:01:47.740> really<00:01:48.009> our<00:01:48.130> objective

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
their throat that's really our objective

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.120 
their throat that's really our objective
well<00:01:49.810> air<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.020> out<00:01:50.200> when<00:01:50.350> we<00:01:50.470> need<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.830> but<00:01:51.039> we

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
well air it out when we need to but we

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.320 
well air it out when we need to but we
really<00:01:51.310> need<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.490> pound<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.850> rock<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.240> we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
really need to pound the rock and we

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.179 
really need to pound the rock and we
need<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.539> stop<00:01:52.750> their<00:01:52.990> offense<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.799> see<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.009> lot

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
need to stop their offense we see a lot

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.070 
need to stop their offense we see a lot
of<00:01:54.220> trips<00:01:54.549> from<00:01:54.759> them<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.240> we'll<00:01:55.390> see<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.630> lot

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
of trips from them and we'll see a lot

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.679 
of trips from them and we'll see a lot
of<00:01:56.110> stacks<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:56.770> what<00:01:56.979> we<00:01:57.130> do<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.549> play<00:01:58.209> from<00:01:58.539> our

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
of stacks so what we do is play from our

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.059 
of stacks so what we do is play from our
best<00:01:58.899> advantage<00:01:59.170> we'll<00:01:59.500> play<00:01:59.709> our<00:01:59.740> base

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
best advantage we'll play our base

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.609 
best advantage we'll play our base
defense<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.939> hopefully<00:02:01.720> make<00:02:01.899> stops<00:02:02.229> against

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
defense and hopefully make stops against

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.490 
defense and hopefully make stops against
it<00:02:02.740> me<00:02:03.009> being<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.429> corner<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.909> like<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.539> make<00:02:05.470> a
