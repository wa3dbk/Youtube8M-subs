00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.719
 site all point ru solve 461 problems 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.880
 here we just need to calculate means 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.309
 look under the letter and we have here 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.029
 two brackets reach not here brackets yes and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:28.849
 here's the brackets let's count first in 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:40.129
 first brackets 18 thousand three hundred 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:42.629
 eighty four plus 19800 47 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 some big numbers up in first 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.140
 brackets but let's try to add 7 to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:56.789
 4 11 1 write 1 in mind 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.520
 8 to 4 12 and one more thing 13 3 we write 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.610
 1 in mind 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:10.280
 8 to 311 and another one by you 12 2 we write 1 in 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 mind 9 to 1 mmi 10 and even 818 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 8 we write 1 in mind 1 to 1 to 1 in mind 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:31.200
 Moreover 330 8231 30 8231 so you 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.549
 is obtained in the first bracket and in the second 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.960
 brackets let's also count how many 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.540
 we get there in the second bracket 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.820
 first 384 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:53.009
 minus 201 384 minus 201 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.070
 we read them 4 subtract 1 will be 3 of 8 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.540
 subtract 0 will be eight out of three subtract 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.430
 2 will be 1 is 183 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:09.740
 here from subtraction you get 183 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.740
 and back at 183 minus 183 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.659
 see here we got 183 and 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.829
 still subtract 183 183 minus 183 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.120
 it turns out 0 and the second bracket in the first 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.060
 brackets we got this number 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.239
 and in the second bracket it turned out 0 and it is necessary 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.970
 multiply 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.459
 here we counted brackets turned out 0 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.709
 if some number is multiplied by zero then 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.010
 always work out 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:44.890
 0 here is the answer under the letter a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.959
 it turns out we are looking under the letter b 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.970
 let's also count separately first 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:56.260
 in the first bracket how many 1 pieces will turn out 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.370
 two thousand eight hundred thirty nine 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.970
 minus 937 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:11.420
 930 oh 970 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:14.269
 939 subtract 9 minus 9 is obtained 0 3 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.560
 minus 3 it turns out 0 from the eight 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.230
 Nine we can not deduct from 18 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.780
 9 subtract will be nine from deuce 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.239
 occupied remained edinichka that we 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.829
 It turns out in the first bracket you have from 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.569
 first brace from the first soon kuras 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.840
 it turned out 1900 further sign multiply 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:40.069
 I stood and what you get in the second 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.230
 brackets let's think about 577 divided by 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.900
 577 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.440
 if the number is divisible by itself 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 it is always a unit if 15 divided by 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.919
 15 will be one if 100 divided by 100 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.970
 there will be one if 238 divided by 238 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.549
 will be one and if 577 divided by 577 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.260
 will be 1 if we divide the number into itself 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.750
 it always turns out to be one if we 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.569
 some number multiplied by 1 then 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.440
 This number from multiplication will turn out 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:19.209
 on 1 the number does not change therefore under 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.160
 the letter b is 1900 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.630
 Here is a country an unexpected challenge I 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.020
 I did not even expect that we will succeed here 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.710
 0 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.740
 many numbers thought so looks like a number 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.449
 big here even see there 38,000 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.050
 thought about wow much turned out 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.930
 only 0 this turned out to be easy 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.970
 the problem is quite well what's all about me 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.770
 my name is Andrei Andreich my site is everything 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.770
