00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.370
 The same question I asked myself there 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.799
 I make you two more points lost 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.290
 in the last 15 matches are only 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.790
 Conquered four still gives to stay 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.000
 thinking title 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.630
 we have 15 points of course it is always 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
 important you do your homework 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.510
 to win indoors but we know 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.890
 difficulty facing the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.050
 corinthians has a great team one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 great coach 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.779
 of course we have to win 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 our games even more than we have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 now only two games less 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 in these two games being that who seeks 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.920
 of the three points to continue thinking 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.469
 in title 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 ibson and the game against the athletic-go at 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.610
 goias is a direct confrontation 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.040
 if the athletic earn the saints exchange 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 position the saints goes to the position of the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 athletic team is the first in the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.379
 relegation the athletic came to produce 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.649
 for the position of the saints 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.800
 somehow worries to worry 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.829
 in worry it is not quiet is 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.960
 looking to work doing our part 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.100
 who enter the field and always in 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.690
 search for victory 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.790
 So we're going to look for this in this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 game we know of the difficulty 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.360
 They face up goiÃ¢nia indoors in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 golden saw 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 we go in search of the three points 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 ibson is what you can talk about the lack 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
 Elano's right in the middle of the field and will not 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.650
 be suspended playing on the other hand 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.020
 has neymar and goose edu back 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.700
 Dracena is also out and also talking 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.290
 A little of you here in the yearnings 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 that you arrived muricy has harnessed 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.939
 quite you have played the most 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 of the games that you think of this one 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.680
 competition in the industry that has great 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.670
 players a great player that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:48.570
 helps a lot 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.530
 also said that neymar does a lot 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.790
 lack 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.180
 are two great players and it is good that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.399
 I'll take sequence with the time it goes 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.340
 picking up the pace I've played five games 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.000
 I hope the trend now is always 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 improve 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.840
 so I hope I can continue 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 trying 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 where the best muricy possible 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.470
 I only got more and more today 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.110
 growing on the table 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.420
 y to these two less games is that the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.550
 Saints have saints had these 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.480
 six points today the saints would be the tenth 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.330
 placed 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.140
 It's still little for a team like the Saints. 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.940
 also thinks 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.209
 in fact I think every competition 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.959
 who presents himself holy in search of the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.340
 title 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.890
 of course he is in a middle position 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.269
 complicated but has to increase self 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.150
 confidence up there 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.840
 Of course we still have a cast. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 For good, a competent cast that has 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.040
 conditions to get up there both in 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.190
 search for it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.110
 y oooo saints and saints think is already 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.480
 learning has yet to learn to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.860
 play without the neymar and the goose as already 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.299
 happened and will happen more often 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 this year because they will have more 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.560
 calls and another question do you think 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.870
 the saints saw a common team without these 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 two players 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.319
 I think it's not clear that you've lost 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.160
 neymar goose are missing for 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.639
 any team he would play 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.430
 had played and would not have done much 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.690
 lack are much needed but the saints have 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.069
 quality players have a cast 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.420
 strong have not seen a common team have to 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.660
 show it in some games I do not 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.609
 was here but demonstrated and denied 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.340
 to liberators out of the house like this already 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.930
 said then we have to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.660
 getting used to because they are 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.609
 always have calls 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.780
 Hold on, people have to be prepared to 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.060
 that 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.739
 y o saints have not yet won away from home 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.450
 in this brazilian championship 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.910
 What you need to do differently for 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.709
 to win this victory because the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.019
 santos has not maybe been able to show 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.120
 the same football out of what he 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.180
 shows when he is principal 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.950
 We have to have patience to look for 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.829
 always the goal 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.639
 We have been playing well in the same game. 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.959
 The important thing is not to suffer a goal 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.359
 if we can make a goal and 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.989
 win three more points then I 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.989
 I think this is the most important
