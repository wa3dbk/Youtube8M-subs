00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.410
 It's always so soft on this sideboard 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.940
 Made with plywood 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:19.510
 After I made the ground here 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.490
 When I pull the side with a cutter knife 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.260
 And that continue to cut the Hmm suit on the ground that continue to cut this 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.270
 Though 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.270
 that 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.990
 This time about the board of hard cypress 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.910
 Especially that little can not be the work um 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:43.690
 Suddenly mind Te Tsukimashi 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:48.680
 Before making a turn and making that ground , here to some extent 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:54.320
 I would like to work on taking away atari 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:58.110
 I was pasting here in the previous video in the previous video, but say like this 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.680
 I managed to get rid of it 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.790
 I made it easy to break up and cut it 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.600
 eh 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.600
 As we do now with setting that there is a way to go diagonally like this 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.110
 Please 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.590
 I say this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.790
 Fell into a trap of 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.790
 Say only takako Then a little one stage 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.380
 So thin 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.630
 If it is remaining that out it key is interesting this will be used to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630
 It will be year 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 Hmm 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.710
 Body here 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.220
 8 upsurge God year worth it a little so wonder if this side 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.390
 I think Henry 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.239
 Finally a little 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.960
 Because 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.240
 Does the 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:56.170
 In this way each board looks like this on the ground 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.170
 Since I arrived approximate per game I would like to cut 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.940
 Those thin I Nde meaning I also referred to as the cypress 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.770
 It cuts with a design knife 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.040
 In 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.040
 I will receive along with the direction of the life of the tree 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.460
 It is quite good 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:35.269
 In such Fu at the time that this cut 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.950
 Is better better not to this kind of wind is not put this body here in the absolute is nice ne 9 polite 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:43.490
 Because there is such a time to go down 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:47.480
 That's kind of like covering something with something like this, but it is better to have it 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.010
 There are times when it is time to put on putting on running the shutte 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.280
 You should put it in the direction 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.230
 If this height is a little left 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.349
 What 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.130
 It's like pouring paper clay and pouring it 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.410
 In this 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.520
 I think I can do it while I cut it a little more 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.720
 Since then 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.480
 Here I 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.010
 It is a cross section here but at 45 degrees 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.569
 I will cut it 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.569
 I do not need to be 45 but 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.030
 To say 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.270
 It is such a thing 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.310
 I understand 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.460
 Cross section 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.370
 If you make it a sharp angle 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.650
 Another time when I was a professional 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.320
 Good here 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.150
 It will be painful. 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.640
 Feeling of cross section 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.640
 I think it will be cool than salt 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.800
 I will leave it a little more 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.560
 ch 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.870
 t will 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 I will 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.000
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.000
 th 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.900
 th 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:24.449
 It is still above 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.400
 Yes, because it does so there may be either a place that protrude a little more adhesive 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.540
 Because 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:33.850
 After drying, I apply a file again and remove it 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.850
 I want to move on to varnishing
