00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone with you hi in the mine and since 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.779
 I haven't done anything for a long time 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.620
 I thought and decided to sip this one 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.630
 thing in a series of commercials unless of course this 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 get a good comment a lot of likes 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.680
 i would like to tell you more a 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.630
 Cast in team now after all very 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 becoming popular is not an easy game to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 pub and games with the team there is no m m and because 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 everyone wants to go to international 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.289
 earn a bunch of dough and today I wanted 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.449
 would like to tell you more about the role of kerry 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.480
 Kerry this characters late game 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.910
 the potential of which is revealed after 25 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 30 minutes and from every minute everything remains 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 stronger and stronger abilities of such 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 characters made in such a way that than 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.680
 the more characteristics you have the stronger 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.390
 valid these abilities worth 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 remember at least the backstab of the river 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.829
 dependent on and dexterity and likkrit and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.230
 jagernaut depending on the amount of it 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 damage many believe that kerry is the most 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 light role in the game however it is not quite 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 that's right because on kerry lies a huge 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 responsibility as if he doesn't 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.020
 farm a lot 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.570
 or will he die often so 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 will remain useless piece of meat 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.689
 running around the map often 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.790
 Kerry Heroes No Strong Attackers 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.439
 spells and represent real 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.020
 threat they start only after 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.299
 good farm beginning of the game almost all 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.950
 carry very weak and of course their over 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.080
 protect and help them as much as possible 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 so for a carry hero a great choice 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.320
 are the easy line top for the dyr for 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.450
 for rediant 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 however, you should not go there anyway 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 Alone it is desirable that next to Kerry 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.579
 there was always a hero who could 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.100
 hold up opponents or any 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.350
 way to save kerry is also important to have with 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 are legends of health 1 pack tango and 1 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.460
 health jar will look perfect 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 in any guppy and of course know about 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 the priorities of the beginning of the game most important for 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 kerry is the last person you need 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.649
 try to finish as much as possible 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.409
 creeps however if you have real 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.000
 the ability to kill the enemy from the last 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.799
 you can still be distracted but not 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.049
 get carried away because at the beginning you are very weak 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.399
 and you can easily die yourself if you 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.590
 on the line everything is not going well 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.780
 ask for your gangalis 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 a real chance to make gold and a little 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.860
 ease the pressure on the line and so we 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 finished the initial stage of the game and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.420
 go to the mid game which can 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.220
 count started from about 15 minutes 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.709
 so what do we need to do mid-game 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.270
 farm correctly forget about fight 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.190
 the most important thing is that you can now 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.500
 maximize your farm by 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.330
 free lines where there are no enemies and besides 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.069
 you are already strong enough to 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.590
 to easily take all the creeps from the line 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.420
 and from the forest however you still need 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.040
 always carry tp scroll because 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 critical moment he can help you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.240
 escape from enemies or break into battle 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190
 near your tower and get some 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.320
 important killings and accordingly so 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.270
 we need gold by the way when you farm 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.430
 free line don't forget that 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.410
 you still dry it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.750
 and enemies can easily chase you into 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.970
 case you went too far and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.650
 finally we got to the point where 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.170
 we get really strong 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.330
 light if you had a good first two 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.280
 stages of the game now you should have 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.320
 good topics and you should be enough 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.870
 strong that you cope alone with 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.790
 two and sometimes with three opponents 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 not worth being too aggressive yes and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.420
 you still play as a team you don't 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 must initiate files for this in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.470
 your team has other characters 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.060
 your goal as soon as possible to kill the most 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.519
 dangerous opponents in the enemy team 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.120
 with at the side with strong nukes type alina 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.920
 or Lena 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.650
 or enemy carry in case 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.810
 he is weaker than you otherwise you can 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.630
 him die well now let's a little 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.760
 let's talk about strange 9 carry a lot 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.370
 controversy enters the internet about who 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.410
 all the same is stronger but in fact no one 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.510
 not stronger they are just different 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.910
 strange carry have a large stock 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.829
 health and large regions agility 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.660
 kerry have greater protection and 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.329
 attack speed can be made from this 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.760
 the conclusion that the countries are getting strong 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.560
 a little earlier they have a painful beat 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.570
 enough of them and the mail survive the fight with 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.430
 other side later pour 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.980
 carry agility have great speed 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.870
 attacks and this is after all additional DPS 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.519
 on this for today I hope you all 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.470
