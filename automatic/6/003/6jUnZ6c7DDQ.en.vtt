00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:02.560
 You too 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 Dr 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.809
 Here it is idle Transformers Euro from Gerbers gate 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.560
 that is in 2007 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.609
 high-spirited 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.710
 timeless and 2 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.429
 also Robert Moonen or whatever you can write yourself today 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.609
 yes, because GBP had bought into it 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.399
 What you say that turns 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.950
 and connect it 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.950
 I know that too - I do not really like this figure 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.389
 SID does not care what is free in life 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:48.060
 no one 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.790
 she does not care 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.010
 no idea what's up with this figure 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 I throw as best I can 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.970
 because want to show over Christmas 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.660
 so did not swing into the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.980
 read individually 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 that divides content in the evening Schumann position bring 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.310
 so the Peak Performance and here the tank 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.590
 the front just sticks out 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 the after many 0 from the year of Herne 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 and just in front of passengers on all sides 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.170
 the whole thing 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 do not be shy prieto 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 and 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.020
 these two 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.590
 Parts of pages are also hijacked computer Kita he shot out the same 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.680
 that lie first 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.940
 So that's how his legs learn 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.830
 let's turn that weird 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.030
 and the feet house 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.619
 so grabbed the Casa rehab stop at nothing it should not warn again 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.850
 fear 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.020
 rightly 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 this passage their wet 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.399
 chosen as successor 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.199
 the Fous rightly 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.749
 an innovation 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.749
 zoom 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.279
 zoom 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.179
 The tool will be set aside for now 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 Half turned 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.589
 he is funny you would have from these 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.439
 No 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.759
 Pat has passages he has so here and that you get terrific arms because of 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:35.539
 can 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.299
 and they can attend easy and busy advisory boards but no 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.469
 we do it differently 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.469
 I was one or the other determined to leave immediately 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.149
 already happened 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.149
 after clicking in real-time biting is finished 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.839
 that brings the small positions 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.609
 takes care of her 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.199
 turns once 180 degrees 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.349
 Pushes the two sides that tank last strong 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.179
 the arm did not happen yet 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.179
 so grabbed the game in positions 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.049
 the match 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.499
 the introduced 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.699
 that comes down that can come too 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.399
 to work this one out 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.129
 yes there are two small ones back there 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.129
 Teichmann right to pack 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.929
 on his first evening, it made 1 1 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.929
 so that it does not cool down again 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:49.910
 the game started again 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.719
 from his place 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.659
 so 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.769
 Quast showers finished you can do the part and sound 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.769
 she moved and has in the Hochtaunus 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.729
 that is the origin 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.729
 Dr I have my opinion on it I give myself 4 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.260
 in which the cap is located 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.239
 Twilight 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.840
 It is not one that the policy will necessarily recommend now 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
 or if someone is the foreword or not 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.009
 frightened 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.580
 Money more he wanted than expected 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.699
 is not synonymous drunk alcohol 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.930
 So he is always like this before he is 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.509
 Peter s 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:32.930
 but the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.110
 No 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.180
 I'm thanking except that spectators 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.439
 and again shoulder
