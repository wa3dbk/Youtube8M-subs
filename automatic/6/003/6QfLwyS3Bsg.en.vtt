00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.059
 hello gamers what is it like to talk about scary 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.340
 yes gentlemen here we continue with the new 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.250
 series of streak points on white 2 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.650
 and the turn is from the hunter drone or 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.320
 footwear the hunter is a small plane 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.000
 little one that we explain it we took it out 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.619
 from the pocket I do not know how the hell 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.050
 we take a plane those in the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.570
 pocket but good is this way for 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.900
 unfold this plane we need a 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.050
 streak of 525 points more or less like that 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.690
 as five casualties 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.970
 Well, if you activate the video and obviously the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.170
 limit is giving points for each low 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 while it is in the air 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.700
 the hunter drone 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.660
 it's a kind of rc xd but not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.010
 manned to search for the enemy 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.790
 automatically or an enemy vehicle and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.540
 it blows up they give us 25 points for 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.000
 the low of this plane and good there 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.700
 is my fifth casualties I already have the drone 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.400
 hunter what sack look at the technical thing for that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.100
 in your pocket and there goes we let go 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.340
 look for the enemy and look will confirm 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 they gave us 25 points for being here in the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.400
 video I'll show you more or less the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.740
 travel that does the truth is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 too fast and we do not have to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 say it well time to react the boom 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 bum so the enemy will explode it back 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 shreds and pails for example on a map 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.479
 well open it serves us too much because 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 there is no way to escape from there look no 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.210
 I expected it from any flower album 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.100
 Daddy see you next time sometimes not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.570
 I know what's wrong with this fagot 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.150
 because one deploys it does the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.820
 travel here can see how how 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.240
 they fly freely through the air 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.050
 this great map and well there it is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.720
 looking for what is the enemy 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.920
 there I am trying to catch it because it is 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.790
 too quickly 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.930
 good low low low yes friend low follows 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.950
 A) Yes 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.890
 follow, follow 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.890
 follow 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.760
 and so so so so so look where 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.760
 exploits this bastard 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.870
 I'm without good live people 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.220
