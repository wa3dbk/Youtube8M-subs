00:00:05.187 --> 00:00:07.528
 A man who has never been to a movie theater 

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:10.611
 Across the man's house 

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:13.190
 The movie theater was coming. 

00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:16.468
 A movie theater with red and comfortable chairs 

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:19.390
 But the man never went in. 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.097
 The man's anger was due to his unwavering faith. 

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.372
 - It's a movie theater? 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.026
 - It's like a madman. 

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:30.026
 - I will never go! 

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:40.979
 This was because they did not know what a movie theater was. 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:48.135
 I was afraid that if people were so big on the screen, 

00:00:49.268 --> 00:00:53.355
 I was afraid of the flickering and flickering light to inflame everything. 

00:00:55.094 --> 00:01:00.270
 By the way, I hear ... every second I see the picture moving in twenty or so. 

00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.599
 I could not believe it at all. 

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:10.902
 But that day goes by so ... 

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:13.714
 One year a year goes ... 

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:17.639
 At his last moment, 

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:20.714
 Just before his last breath 

00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:23.683
 The man closed his eyes. 

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:26.182
 I remembered my childhood. 

00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:28.414
 Love is, 

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:30.853
 Joy. 

00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:33.472
 And 

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:34.542
 finally 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.163
 I realized the beauty of the movie. 

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:41.392
 Telecine. 

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:46.000
 There is no movie. 

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:59.594
 'Go to the movies.'
