00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.349
 Today I propose to test here 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.900
 such a usb cable and micro and micro usb 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.780
 Specially ordered cable usually often 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 very lost so I think $ 2 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.720
 I will cheaply order such a cable 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 lowered in stock 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 that's what we have here is enough 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.180
 not so thick of course but somewhere 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.969
 about centimeters maybe 90 meters 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.059
 I want to test about a meter 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.440
 see if it works or not 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 workable now connect 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.910
 telephone number 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.770
 and look how he cable came without here 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 so kind 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.260
 studied without an adapter without anything one 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:12.930
 I have a cable like this 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:16.350
 power supply now turn it on so we 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.860
 see here through the power adapter all 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.170
 charging it is clear that the charge is on 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 cable cable functioning possible 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.729
 just try to connect yusbi 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.890
 directly to the computer via usb port 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:39.229

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.229
 charging 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.520
 such a test showed that the cable 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:57.660
 the worker can be bought on the site he is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.610

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.380
 cents but there are two options white
