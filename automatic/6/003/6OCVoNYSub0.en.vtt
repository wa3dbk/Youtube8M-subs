your<00:03:49.090> major<00:03:49.270> scale<00:03:49.600> patterns<00:03:50.190> now<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.790> chords

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
your major scale patterns now the chords

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.090 
your major scale patterns now the chords
and<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.660> structure<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.200> song<00:03:53.410> everything

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
and the structure of the song everything

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.440 
and the structure of the song everything
is<00:03:54.220> based<00:03:54.520> on<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.240> major<00:03:55.840> scale<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:01.180> chord

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
is based on the a major scale the chord

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.150 
is based on the a major scale the chord
progression<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.080> actually<00:04:02.440> based<00:04:02.620> on<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:04.500> 15<00:04:05.500> 4

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
progression is actually based on a 15 4

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.600 
progression is actually based on a 15 4
chord<00:04:06.820> progression<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.590> since<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.340> chord

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
chord progression so since the chord

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.270 
chord progression so since the chord
progression<00:04:10.270> is<00:04:10.480> based<00:04:10.750> out<00:04:10.960> of<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.350> than<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.130> is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
progression is based out of a than it is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.180 
progression is based out of a than it is
the<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.700> scale<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.840> must<00:04:14.020> use<00:04:14.470> if<00:04:14.770> you

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the a scale that you must use if you

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.950 
the a scale that you must use if you
want<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.490> play<00:04:15.940> over<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.239> top<00:04:16.450> if<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.690> want<00:04:16.900> to
