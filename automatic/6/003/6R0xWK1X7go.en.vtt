00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of macro level politics but this show is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.140 
of macro level politics but this show is
about<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:22.290> small<00:01:22.650> small<00:01:23.340> town<00:01:23.549> stuff<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
about very small small town stuff so a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.100 
about very small small town stuff so a
city<00:01:24.840> council<00:01:25.500> seat<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.810> whole
