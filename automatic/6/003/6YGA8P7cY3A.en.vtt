00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
to talk to you about oxy absorbers

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.160 
to talk to you about oxy absorbers
there's<00:00:05.580> three<00:00:05.819> types<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.270> oxygen<00:00:06.690> orbiter<00:00:07.049> we

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
there's three types of oxygen orbiter we

oxy<00:00:48.840> absorber<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.410> take<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.190> throw

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
oxy absorber you take that and you throw

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
oxy absorber you take that and you throw
it<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> bag<00:00:51.239> shake<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.410> little

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
bit kind of push some of the air out and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
bit kind of push some of the air out and
then<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.590> seal<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> socks

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
then you seal it now what the socks

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.430 
then you seal it now what the socks
either<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.930> do

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
either will do

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
either will do
just<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> name<00:00:59.250> says<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> will

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just like the name says is it it will

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
just like the name says is it it will
absorb<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> oxygen<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:02.070> absorb<00:01:02.399> all

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
absorb the oxygen you know absorb all

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
absorb the oxygen you know absorb all
the<00:01:02.640> oxygen<00:01:02.940> inside<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.780> bag<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.379> going

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the oxygen inside the bag it's not going

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.030 
the oxygen inside the bag it's not going
to<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> air<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:06.330> it'll<00:01:06.540> prevent

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
to take the air out but it'll prevent

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
to take the air out but it'll prevent
well<00:01:08.040> towards<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> oxygen<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.510> prevents

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
well towards the oxygen so it prevents

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
well towards the oxygen so it prevents
any<00:01:10.049> insects<00:01:10.500> mold<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> bacteria<00:01:11.490> that's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
any insects mold and bacteria that's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.950 
any insects mold and bacteria that's
growing<00:01:12.180> inside<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.010> bag<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> food<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
growing inside the bag of the food and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530 
growing inside the bag of the food and
so<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.740> combine<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.490> mylar<00:01:17.850> bag<00:01:18.119> with

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
so when you combine the mylar bag with

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
so when you combine the mylar bag with
the<00:01:18.960> oxy<00:01:19.380> absorber<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> long

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the oxy absorber you can have a long

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
the oxy absorber you can have a long
