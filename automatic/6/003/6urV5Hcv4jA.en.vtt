00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.040 
only need this one needle and it can be
good<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.219> many<00:00:59.370> projects<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.149> opposed<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
good for so many projects as opposed to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.429 
good for so many projects as opposed to
if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.590> were<00:01:02.039> using<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.879> 32<00:01:03.570> inch<00:01:03.600> circular<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
if you were using a 32 inch circular and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
if you were using a 32 inch circular and
then<00:01:04.589> hat<00:01:04.830> needing<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> 24<00:01:06.210> inch

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
then hat needing to go down to a 24 inch

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
then hat needing to go down to a 24 inch
circular<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> 16<00:01:07.590> inch<00:01:07.770> circular<00:01:08.220> than

double<00:01:08.850> points<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> work<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.320> example

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
double points just to work for example

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.969 
double points just to work for example
the<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:11.040> shaping<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> hat<00:01:12.470> with<00:01:13.470> Magic<00:01:13.830> Loop

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the top shaping of a hat with Magic Loop

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
the top shaping of a hat with Magic Loop
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> use<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.420> same<00:01:15.630> needle<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.110> all

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you can use the same needle for all

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.399 
you can use the same needle for all
those<00:01:16.710> diameters<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.509> theory<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
those diameters so the theory here is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310 
those diameters so the theory here is
that<00:01:19.799> we've<00:01:20.700> got<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.330> needle<00:01:21.720> because<00:01:22.020> we've

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that we've got the needle because we've

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
that we've got the needle because we've
pulled<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> loop<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.119> show<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pulled this loop out here to show you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.149 
pulled this loop out here to show you
we've<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> needle<00:01:25.290> dividing<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> work

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
we've got the needle dividing the work

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.450 
we've got the needle dividing the work
into<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.530> front<00:01:28.770> needle<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
into the like the front needle and the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
into the like the front needle and the
back<00:01:29.640> needle<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.150> we'll<00:01:30.360> switch<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.840> right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
back needle which we'll switch so right

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
back needle which we'll switch so right
now<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> front<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
now this is the front and this is the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
now this is the front and this is the
back<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.869> working<00:01:34.229> around

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
back then I'm going to be working around

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
back then I'm going to be working around
and<00:01:35.159> around<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> around<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.360> be

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and around and around so this will be

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.330 
and around and around so this will be
the<00:01:36.570> front<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> back<00:01:37.650> but

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the front and this will be the back but

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
the front and this will be the back but
this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> presenting<00:01:39.450> side<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.530> I'll<00:01:40.680> use

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
this is the presenting side so I'll use

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
this is the presenting side so I'll use
that<00:01:41.100> language<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> say<00:01:41.850> first<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.689> working

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that language to say first I'm working

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.240 
that language to say first I'm working
on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> presenting<00:01:43.590> side<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.159> I'll

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on the presenting side and then I'll

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.389 
on the presenting side and then I'll
work<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> side<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:46.110> order<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> work<00:01:47.220> on

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
work on this side in order to work on

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.020 
work on this side in order to work on
the<00:01:47.579> Magic<00:01:47.909> Loop<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.680> set<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> front

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.899 
the Magic Loop you have to set the front
needle<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> stitches<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.460> sliding

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
needle in to the stitches so I'm sliding

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.240 
needle in to the stitches so I'm sliding
it<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:55.049> stitches<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.500> loaded<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.040> on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it in so these stitches are loaded up on

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.550 
it in so these stitches are loaded up on
the<00:01:56.369> front<00:01:56.640> needle<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.090> ready<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the front needle and ready to go and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
the front needle and ready to go and
then<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.399> can't<00:01:59.759> knit<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.450> needle<00:02:00.780> until

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
then I can't knit with this needle until

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.050 
then I can't knit with this needle until
I<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.649> enough<00:02:01.890> cable<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.640> able<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> pull

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I have enough cable to be able to pull

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
I have enough cable to be able to pull
it<00:02:03.180> around<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.600> position<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it around and position it just like I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740 
it around and position it just like I
normally<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.000> any<00:02:06.210> other<00:02:06.329> type<00:02:06.719> of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
normally would with any other type of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.650 
normally would with any other type of
needle<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> why<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.550> need<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> 40<00:02:09.479> inch

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
needle so this is why you need a 40 inch

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.559 
needle so this is why you need a 40 inch
circular<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.890> pushed<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.300> tried<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
circular I have pushed it and tried to

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.660 
circular I have pushed it and tried to
do<00:02:12.810> Magic<00:02:13.170> Loop<00:02:13.319> on

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
do Magic Loop on

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.300 
do Magic Loop on
something<00:02:13.970> shorter<00:02:14.630> I'd<00:02:14.959> say<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.740> possible

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
something shorter I'd say it's possible

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.830 
something shorter I'd say it's possible
once<00:02:16.670> you're<00:02:16.819> proficient<00:02:17.300> at<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.720> use<00:02:17.810> a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
once you're proficient at this to use a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 
once you're proficient at this to use a
32<00:02:18.410> inch<00:02:18.440> circular<00:02:19.130> needle<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.420> might<00:02:20.630> be

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
32 inch circular needle but you might be

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.540 
32 inch circular needle but you might be
kinking<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.650> cables<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.220> little<00:02:22.400> because

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
kinking the cables a little because

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.160 
kinking the cables a little because
you're<00:02:22.670> really<00:02:22.849> you're<00:02:23.450> trying<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.900> get<00:02:23.989> more

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
you're really you're trying to get more

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.900 
you're really you're trying to get more
length<00:02:24.440> than<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.739> actually<00:02:25.099> have<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.520> would

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
length than you actually have I would

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.490 
length than you actually have I would
never<00:02:26.180> do<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.569> with<00:02:26.660> anything<00:02:26.989> as<00:02:27.110> short<00:02:27.319> as<00:02:27.470> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
never do it with anything as short as a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
24 inch not for using this method so

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.640 
24 inch not for using this method so
this<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.180> my<00:02:32.330> Magic<00:02:32.690> Loop<00:02:32.870> that's<00:02:33.260> pulled<00:02:33.530> out

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
this is my Magic Loop that's pulled out

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.680 
this is my Magic Loop that's pulled out
over<00:02:33.890> here<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.000> basically<00:02:35.030> is

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
over here and what it is basically is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.809 
over here and what it is basically is
it's<00:02:35.900> lots<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.380> give<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.459> can<00:02:37.610> pull<00:02:37.790> a

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
it's lots of give so that I can pull a

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.140 
it's lots of give so that I can pull a
loop<00:02:38.030> out<00:02:38.209> over<00:02:38.569> here<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.190> be<00:02:40.190> able<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.580> work

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
loop out over here and be able to work

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.020 
loop out over here and be able to work
properly<00:02:41.420> with<00:02:41.840> my<00:02:41.959> needles<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.760> all

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
properly with my needles so this is all

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.750 
properly with my needles so this is all
a<00:02:44.060> knit<00:02:44.510> round<00:02:44.720> I'm<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.220> make<00:02:46.400> sure<00:02:46.430> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
a knit round I'm going to make sure that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.380 
a knit round I'm going to make sure that
the<00:02:46.880> yarn<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.450> behind<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.530> needle<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
the yarn is behind the needle and the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.780 
the yarn is behind the needle and the
way<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.750> remember<00:02:51.140> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.620> however<00:02:52.489> I'm

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
way that I remember this is however I'm

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.500 
way that I remember this is however I'm
putting<00:02:53.120> my<00:02:53.239> needle<00:02:53.540> into<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.989> first<00:02:54.380> stitch

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
putting my needle into the first stitch

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.420 
putting my needle into the first stitch
that's<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.840> inform<00:02:57.140> where<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.799> yarn<00:02:58.069> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
that's going to inform where the yarn is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.120 
that's going to inform where the yarn is
if<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.090> was<00:02:59.209> doing<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.480> purl<00:02:59.780> stitch<00:03:00.100> where<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
if I was doing a purl stitch where the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.160 
if I was doing a purl stitch where the
yarn<00:03:01.430> needs<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.760> be<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:01.970> front<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.510> would<00:03:02.840> want

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
yarn needs to be in front I would want

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.600 
yarn needs to be in front I would want
the<00:03:03.260> yarn<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.590> be<00:03:03.680> coming<00:03:04.010> down<00:03:04.280> here<00:03:04.519> from

Beha or from underneath the needle but

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.280 
Beha or from underneath the needle but
because<00:03:07.340> my<00:03:07.489> first<00:03:07.730> stitch<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.299> knit<00:03:08.480> all<00:03:09.110> I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
because my first stitch is a knit all I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.039 
because my first stitch is a knit all I
do<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.709> slip<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.069> needle<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.700> here<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.690> front

do is slip the needle in here in front
of<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.440> yarn<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.549> yarn<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.970> behind

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
of the yarn so that the yarn is behind
