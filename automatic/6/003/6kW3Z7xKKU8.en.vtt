00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
then unfortunately the economy has

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.590 
then unfortunately the economy has
affected<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.739> lot<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:33.010> people<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:34.450> a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.610 
hardship of having you know a lot of
children<00:03:37.269> sometimes<00:03:37.570> people<00:03:38.049> with<00:03:38.320> not<00:03:38.470> that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
children sometimes people with not that

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.690 
children sometimes people with not that
they<00:03:38.709> don't<00:03:38.830> want<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.220> take<00:03:39.340> care<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.580> the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700
