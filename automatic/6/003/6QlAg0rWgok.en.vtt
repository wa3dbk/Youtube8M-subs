00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
delay but I doubt it's some big

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.100 
delay but I doubt it's some big
conspiracy<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:30.030> probably<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.540> some

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
conspiracy it's probably just some

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
conspiracy it's probably just some
miscommunication<00:02:31.890> Warner<00:02:32.340> Brothers<00:02:32.610> they

miscommunication Warner Brothers they

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.790 
miscommunication Warner Brothers they
perhaps<00:02:32.940> bungled<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.810> physical<00:02:34.260> release<00:02:34.560> of

perhaps bungled the physical release of
it<00:02:34.890> over<00:02:35.130> here<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.610> smidge<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.420> have

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
it over here just a smidge and have

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.800 
it over here just a smidge and have
unfortunately<00:02:37.800> weight<00:02:38.040> means<00:02:38.810> having

unfortunately weight means having

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.160

basically let us wait a month for the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.350 
basically let us wait a month for the
title<00:02:43.560> which<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:43.830> not<00:02:44.130> exactly<00:02:44.250> good<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.180> say

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
title which is not exactly good to say

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.230 
title which is not exactly good to say
the<00:02:45.390> least<00:02:46.220> pretty<00:02:47.220> much<00:02:47.340> sucks<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.090> can

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
the least pretty much sucks that we can

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.270 
the least pretty much sucks that we can
have<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.450> wait<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.630> month<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:50.040> what<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
have to wait a month but it is what it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.620 
have to wait a month but it is what it
is<00:02:50.370> i<00:02:50.550> think<00:02:50.730> many<00:02:50.880> people<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.240> just<00:02:51.390> going<00:02:51.570> to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
is i think many people are just going to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.150 
is i think many people are just going to
wait<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.140> come<00:02:52.320> out<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:52.680> well<00:02:53.130> i

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
wait for it to come out because well i

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.890 
wait for it to come out because well i
don't<00:02:53.580> really<00:02:53.670> blame<00:02:53.940> them<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.600> digital

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.430 
don't really blame them the digital
prices<00:02:55.470> are<00:02:55.680> ridiculous<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:56.640> console<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.959> pc

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440

prices are ridiculous on console on pc
fairly<00:02:59.070> standard<00:02:59.550> but<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.090> console<00:03:00.570> you're

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
fairly standard but on console you're

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050

paying 10 to 15 pounds more depending on

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.750 
paying 10 to 15 pounds more depending on
your<00:03:03.150> region<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.630> course<00:03:04.550> but<00:03:05.550> it's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
your region of course but it's

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.600

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.790 
absolutely just wow I genuinely don't
understand<00:03:09.030> why<00:03:09.420> digital<00:03:10.200> games<00:03:10.410> are<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.770> much

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
understand why digital games are so much

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.310 
understand why digital games are so much
more<00:03:10.980> expensive<00:03:11.430> digitally<00:03:12.270> on<00:03:12.510> console<00:03:13.080> I

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
more expensive digitally on console I

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.430 
more expensive digitally on console I
mean<00:03:14.180> they're<00:03:15.180> much<00:03:15.360> cheaper<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.990> distribute

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
mean they're much cheaper to distribute

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.660 
mean they're much cheaper to distribute
you<00:03:16.500> don't<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.890> worry<00:03:17.040> about<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> retail

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
you don't have to worry about the retail

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.280 
you don't have to worry about the retail
at<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.910> box<00:03:18.090> or<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.420> disk<00:03:18.690> or<00:03:19.019> any<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.260> that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
at the box or the disk or any of that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.040 
at the box or the disk or any of that
and<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:20.459> course<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.880> can't<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.330> refunded<00:03:21.870> as

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
and of course they can't be refunded as

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.780 
and of course they can't be refunded as
well<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.739> buy<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.980> game<00:03:23.280> digitally

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
well so if you buy the game digitally

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
well so if you buy the game digitally
and<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.000> don't<00:03:24.209> like<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.660> well<00:03:25.019> sucks<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.769> be

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and you don't like it well sucks to be

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.570 
and you don't like it well sucks to be
you<00:03:26.130> basically<00:03:26.970> which<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.530> pretty<00:03:28.800> pants<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
you basically which is pretty pants to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.930 
you basically which is pretty pants to
be<00:03:29.700> honest<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.030> think<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.660> initial<00:03:31.940> response

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
be honest I think the initial response

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.880 
be honest I think the initial response
to<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.269> when<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.570> comes<00:03:33.780> out<00:03:33.930> digitally<00:03:34.709> in

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
to this when it comes out digitally in

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.770 
to this when it comes out digitally in
the<00:03:34.980> EU<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.489> going<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.120> we're<00:03:36.570> going<00:03:36.690> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the EU is going to be we're going to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.750 
the EU is going to be we're going to
wait<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.950> be<00:03:38.040> honest<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.519> would<00:03:38.670> encourage

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
wait and to be honest I would encourage

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.820 
wait and to be honest I would encourage
all<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.570> do<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.380> don't<00:03:40.590> think

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
all of you to do that but I don't think
