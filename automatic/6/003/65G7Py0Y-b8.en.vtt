00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.930
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.240
 of the best and welcome to a new 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.450
 minecraft video in which I bring you 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.000
 we have called antich atlas and then yes 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.250
 This is a very small one but for the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.050
 explorers could do very well and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.210
 especially because you feel like that in 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.460
 the seniority because you add a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.370
 new map with a new design that would be 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.949
 the atlas and is very father the truth is 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.570
 like old style then this is going 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.370
 to teach so that more or less the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.629
 idea of how it is then we go to the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.670
 mind of kraft eo and the only thing 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.130
 we need is a book and what would it be 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.829
 a compass a compass then the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.719
 we put it like that it does not matter in what order we 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.129
 we go with it in any way and we 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.860
 is going to give our empty 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.360
 antich atlas no this is a little book 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.430
 we click right and what will happen 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.530
 is that you will assign a number that is 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.660
 to this sign the number zero as they are 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.990
 giving account says number zero and if 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.340
 We grab another atlas and open it like 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.060
 that is going to be painted again as you see 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.590
 below it is added as blue with green and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.420
 now assigned the number one is 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.340
 say we can have a lot of maps and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.500
 everyone will have their number 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.359
 so not to lose more or less to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.590
 that is not messy then then 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.409
 here I have number zero number one 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.289
 and number two and now if we open them here 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.960
 we have gentlemen the future of the maps 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.230
 look nothing else we can export a 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.390
 image 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.680
 Well, not to be the location that you 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.750
 you want you can 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.070
 Do not miss out, so to speak 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.490
 then we can add a marker not 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.860
 speaks 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.079
 whatever then we can add 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.399
 brands and what we want so that we 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.790
 it helps pretty and well brands like 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.710
 red like pirate style and then there you 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.030
 says the blocks as well as they can 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.369
 realize you are very easy to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.740
 understand what would be these are the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.799
 trees where I'm standing, right now 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.599
 same then if we go for whatever 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.050
 behind me there are mountains 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.569
 then there is water that is very easy to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.550
 understand and this if I 'm not wrong would be 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.610
 a swamp also when we find 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.980
 villages are drawn some little houses that you 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.019
 they represent that there is a town out there or 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.380
 it is done that explains the map very well 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.690
 and that old style that gives it its 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.209
 touch and it's pretty good I liked it 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.650
 quite especially because I think so 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.019
 combined with some packages 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.569
 textures or whatever resorts packs 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.800
 now that they would be like old style and 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.120
 this map couples perfect 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.280
 You can also use for any 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.900
 adventure map or whatever you want 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.030
 I just liked the way in which 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.340
 is done and then with nothing more to say 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.990
 It is a very small as I said and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.030
 is the only thing that adds the simple 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.130
 atlas is because he is liked already you know 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.870
 that a description has the link of the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.150
 installer to be installed super 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.220
 very fast in a matter of seconds 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.380
 and they will have it if they want it and therefore 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.000
 is updated for several versions and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.880
 you can download it so that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 want for that check in the forum if 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.420
 is available in the version that 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.920
 you want and with nothing more to say 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.960
 You already know that below you have my facebook 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.580

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.230
 funny and anything else that 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.420
 you want to see because I have it there 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.480
 so they are 100% informed of the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.340
 things that happen in the channel now yes I 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.690
 dismissal because he has been delighted already 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.430
 They put a like we will be 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.719
 following 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.519
 I'm leaving in the strips right now 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.379
