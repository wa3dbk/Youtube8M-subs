 nothing in america you could say that 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.489
 make it my problem 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.909
 the church credit is called because of the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.380
 from the big lebowski bistum you are you 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:11.659
 the religion as ski is so this 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.909
 horny scene music daily up to 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.520
 superior to what is now what have we 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.880
 today in the program ranges from the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.200
 Thank you, I'm sure you already 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.950
 you will not be happy after it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:30.020
 a mushroom-I's right is us because 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.289
 the camera the couple was out of wind 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.560
 So brewed with wind energy 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.810
 wind power plant 48 percent alcohol 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.060
 flowers and we barley with water 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:49.880
 malt and hops extract the hearty 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.770
 Westphalian paderborn mushrooms if you 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.729
 this opens a few words to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:02.899
 brewery the brewery the paderborns 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:06.950
 Brewery has been around since 1852 and has been 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.280
 but in 1990 in the warsteiner group 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.330
 recorded 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.810
 objection to ours 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:20.209
 I would sometimes actually say okay 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.890
 nice adhesion great look maria and there 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.380
 jumps at the decent percent against 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.840
 classic mushroom gentleman wide 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.660
 but I think she is too extreme 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.239
 what a little bit it comes like that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.610
 sweet touch with yes what touches it 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.110
 reminds me a bit like these 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.940
 Upper Bavarian bieri could the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 smell a bit like him 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.310
 but behind it hangs already 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:52.959
 so the common nasty hopp suddenly 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.959
 open extract so far so try 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.959
 there and away and hop but the remains 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.989
 This sweet here was what you won 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 hast also came in for a short while 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.360
 taste 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.549
 I have now though somehow what 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.599
 worse presented I find it 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.120
 wants to lead very pleasant 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:19.730
 it does not scratch as extreme as it does 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.970
 but maybe it is but it is 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.519
 so mushroom had been so classic 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:33.590
 I would also have paid so grad 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:36.280
 have to say that it's neat 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.970
 a little bit more in the flowery direction 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.790
 so flowers and a little bit easy 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.190
 At least also important the malt base 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.950
 is something wider yes everything 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 bit sweetish it is really sweetish 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.680
 It was easy for me to do that before 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.950
 take up wind turbine somehow 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.950
 have to 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.959
 do not fly so high my little whole 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.380
 honestly the label already looks 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.849
 bit here so penner clique from the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.530
 honestly looks like so cheap beer 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.220
 but I think I'm positive 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:23.930
 surprised 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:27.410
 hey this station this beer and also 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.470
 there are more with us on our beer 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.349
 So try youtube channel if he does 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.580
 do not miss anything once subscribe 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:39.960
 and write us in the comments 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.430
 the paderborn pilsner finds the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.430
 post still mainstream
