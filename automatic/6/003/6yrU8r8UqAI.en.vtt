out of that how is that done in six well

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.290 
out of that how is that done in six well
I<00:00:07.440> think<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:07.770> have<00:00:07.799> fewer<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> memories<00:00:08.849> in

I think we have fewer of the memories in

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.580 
I think we have fewer of the memories in

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
brilliantly Alfonso really took it and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.420 
brilliantly Alfonso really took it and
and<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> did<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.770> by<00:00:50.100> telling

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and the way you did that was by telling

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
and the way you did that was by telling
the<00:00:50.489> story<00:00:50.789> from<00:00:51.210> Harry's<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.750> give<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
things that didn't relate to that tend

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.380 
things that didn't relate to that tend
to<00:00:54.539> fall<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.489> in<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> film<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.120> very

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to fall out in this film that's very

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.160 
to fall out in this film that's very
much<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> case<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:59.149> and<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.930> most

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
much the case and two and the most

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
much the case and two and the most
significant<00:01:01.739> drop<00:01:01.890> let's<00:01:02.100> apply<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
significant drop let's apply this is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
significant drop let's apply this is
some<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> memories<00:01:03.949> largely<00:01:04.949> because

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
some of the memories largely because

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.429 
some of the memories largely because
Voldemort<00:01:05.700> never<00:01:06.210> appears<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> film<00:01:07.170> as

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
Voldemort never appears in the film as

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.550 
Voldemort never appears in the film as

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
analysis so you're setting up seven and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160 
analysis so you're setting up seven and
you're<00:01:10.970> you're<00:01:11.970> investigating<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.659> character

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
whom as I say well the shadow is cast

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.420 
whom as I say well the shadow is cast
over<00:01:16.200> over<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> film<00:01:17.070> doesn't<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.060> appear

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
anything away but there's a major

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.480 
anything away but there's a major
difference<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> climactic<00:01:25.439> suit<00:01:25.710> from

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
difference in the climactic suit from

difference in the climactic suit from
the<00:01:26.580> books<00:01:26.900> major<00:01:27.900> difference<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.009> i<00:01:29.040> don't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the books major difference but i don't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.880 
the books major difference but i don't
want<00:01:29.810> i<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.930> act<00:01:31.200> without<00:01:31.409> giving<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.829> away

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
want i will act without giving it away

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
want i will act without giving it away
what<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> reason<00:01:33.240> why<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.509> made<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
what one the reason why we made that

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
what one the reason why we made that
decision<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.650> concerned<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.640> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
decision this is concerned and I really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.170 
decision this is concerned and I really
confused<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.100> relies<00:01:38.700> warm

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
confused but is that it relies warm
