at the side a little bit and you just
draw<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.399> diagonal<00:00:53.789> line<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> next<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.109> just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
draw a diagonal line so next I'm just

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.139 
draw a diagonal line so next I'm just
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.559> divide<00:00:58.800> my<00:00:59.010> hair<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.789> even

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
relatively straight I don't want to make

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.080 
relatively straight I don't want to make
a<00:01:08.680> ponytail<00:01:09.130> because<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.520> feel<00:01:09.730> like<00:01:09.760> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
a ponytail because I feel like the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.820 
a ponytail because I feel like the
elastic<00:01:10.390> will<00:01:10.750> crease<00:01:10.990> my<00:01:11.170> hair<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:11.590> I'm<00:01:11.650> just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
elastic will crease my hair so I'm just

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.860 
elastic will crease my hair so I'm just
going<00:01:11.980> to<00:01:12.100> make<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.310> little<00:01:12.550> braid<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:13.600> hold

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
going to make a little braid to hold

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.600 
going to make a little braid to hold
this<00:01:14.110> bottom<00:01:14.440> section<00:01:14.650> of<00:01:14.890> hair<00:01:15.070> out<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.430> my

way<00:01:15.760> by<00:01:16.660> taking<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:17.140> section<00:01:17.380> here<00:01:17.740> at<00:01:17.860> the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
way by taking a section here at the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.890 
way by taking a section here at the
front<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.190> my<00:01:18.280> face<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.690> caterpillar

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
front of my face and the caterpillar

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.469 
front of my face and the caterpillar
braid<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.950> pretty<00:01:21.460> much<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.610> two<00:01:21.850> strand<00:01:22.150> braid

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
braid is pretty much a two strand braid

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.170 
braid is pretty much a two strand braid
and<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:24.220> section<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:27.180> always

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
and one section of there is always

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.030 
and one section of there is always
thicker<00:01:28.540> than<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.140> other<00:01:29.290> one<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
thicker than the other one and it's the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.800 
thicker than the other one and it's the
thin<00:01:30.280> piece<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:30.820> wraps<00:01:31.060> over<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.570> thicker

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
thin piece that wraps over the thicker

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.120 
thin piece that wraps over the thicker
one<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:32.950> kind<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.720> wrap<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:34.930> over<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
one so you kind of wrap it over and

one so you kind of wrap it over and
bring<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.369> through<00:01:39.550> like<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:39.850> kind<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.540> like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.509 

in<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.170> version<00:02:56.409> I<00:02:56.650> started<00:02:57.040> off<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.310> same

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
in this version I started off the same

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.059 
in this version I started off the same
way<00:02:57.579> by<00:02:58.180> making<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.900> caterpillar<00:02:59.560> braid<00:02:59.860> or

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
way by making the caterpillar braid or

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.530 
way by making the caterpillar braid or
rather<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.370> left<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.909> in<00:03:01.030> from<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.360> previous

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
rather I left it in from the previous

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.339 
rather I left it in from the previous
hairstyle<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.730> I'm<00:03:03.939> stopping<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.780> here<00:03:05.170> and

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
hairstyle but I'm stopping just here and

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.740 
hairstyle but I'm stopping just here and
I'm<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.459> continue<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:07.090> by<00:03:07.299> making<00:03:07.480> a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
I'm going to continue this by making a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.809 
I'm going to continue this by making a
double<00:03:07.930> kind<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.409> caterpillar<00:03:09.310> break<00:03:09.610> which

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
double kind of caterpillar break which

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.640 
double kind of caterpillar break which
is<00:03:09.849> basically<00:03:10.329> taking<00:03:10.810> strands<00:03:11.140> from<00:03:11.319> both

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
is basically taking strands from both

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.270 
is basically taking strands from both
sides<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.510> did<00:03:13.629> my<00:03:13.750> last<00:03:13.930> loop<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.590> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
sides so I just did my last loop here so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.580 
sides so I just did my last loop here so
I'm<00:03:15.640> going<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.180> add<00:03:16.540> all<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:17.170> hair<00:03:17.349> together

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
I'm going to add all the hair together

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.390 
I'm going to add all the hair together
and<00:03:21.569> start<00:03:22.569> making<00:03:22.900> loops<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.349> both<00:03:23.379> sides<00:03:23.680> and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
and start making loops on both sides and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.559 
and start making loops on both sides and
I'm<00:03:24.489> just<00:03:24.609> going<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.790> do<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.090> for<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.359> length

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
I'm just going to do that for the length

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.089 
I'm just going to do that for the length
of<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:25.810> hair<00:03:26.049> I'm<00:03:26.290> not<00:03:26.319> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.769> add<00:03:26.890> any

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
of this hair I'm not going to add any

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.610 
of this hair I'm not going to add any
more<00:03:27.370> into<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:30.659> here<00:03:31.659> I've<00:03:31.780> divided<00:03:32.139> my<00:03:32.290> hair

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
more into this here I've divided my hair

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.289 
more into this here I've divided my hair
into<00:03:32.739> two<00:03:33.010> pieces<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.489> I've<00:03:33.730> clipped<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.180> the

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
into two pieces and I've clipped up the

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.420 
into two pieces and I've clipped up the
top<00:03:34.510> half<00:03:34.690> for<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:34.989> moment<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.769> sectioned<00:03:36.340> a

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
top half for a moment I sectioned a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.949 
top half for a moment I sectioned a
small<00:03:36.730> strand<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.329> left<00:03:37.510> side<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
small strand on the left side of the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.390 
small strand on the left side of the
lower<00:03:38.139> portion<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.680> hair<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.159> which<00:03:39.310> would

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
lower portion of hair and which would

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.699 
lower portion of hair and which would
have<00:03:39.549> created<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:40.060> three<00:03:40.299> strand<00:03:40.599> braid<00:03:40.720> with

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
have created a three strand braid with

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.440 
have created a three strand braid with
another<00:03:42.010> small<00:03:42.340> elastic<00:03:42.849> I<00:03:42.970> connected<00:03:43.420> my

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
another small elastic I connected my

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.240 
another small elastic I connected my
caterpillar<00:03:43.840> braid<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.650> three<00:03:44.920> strand

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
caterpillar braid to this three strand

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.830 
caterpillar braid to this three strand
and<00:03:45.430> then<00:03:45.549> let<00:03:45.790> down<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.120> top<00:03:46.299> section<00:03:46.750> of

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
and then let down the top section of

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.569 
and then let down the top section of
hair<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:49.349> decided<00:03:50.349> to<00:03:50.590> take<00:03:50.799> advantage<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.370> my

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
hair I decided to take advantage of my

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.520 
hair I decided to take advantage of my
cool<00:03:51.819> diagonal<00:03:52.450> parting<00:03:52.810> with<00:03:52.959> some<00:03:53.109> accent

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
cool diagonal parting with some accent

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.770 
cool diagonal parting with some accent
braids<00:03:53.799> here<00:03:54.519> I'm<00:03:54.700> simply<00:03:55.090> winging<00:03:55.449> it

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
braids here I'm simply winging it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.839 
braids here I'm simply winging it
I<00:03:55.810> used<00:03:56.290> two<00:03:56.379> rat<00:03:56.590> tail<00:03:56.799> comb<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.430> section<00:03:57.760> a

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
I used two rat tail comb to section a

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.460 
I used two rat tail comb to section a
sliver<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.180> hair<00:03:58.449> which<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.780> French<00:03:59.049> braided

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
sliver of hair which I French braided

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.740 
sliver of hair which I French braided
and<00:03:59.590> in<00:04:00.129> lagertha<00:04:00.519> tradition<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.239> decided<00:04:01.599> that

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
and in lagertha tradition I decided that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:12.720 
and in lagertha tradition I decided that
two<00:04:02.049> micro<00:04:02.440> braids<00:04:02.709> were<00:04:02.919> better<00:04:03.129> than<00:04:03.340> one

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.940 

in<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:14.660> version<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:15.290> started<00:04:15.709> with<00:04:15.860> the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
in this version I started with the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.830 
in this version I started with the
center<00:04:16.280> part<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.700> then<00:04:16.910> used<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.239> comb<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.690> make

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
center part and then used a comb to make

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.030 
center part and then used a comb to make
