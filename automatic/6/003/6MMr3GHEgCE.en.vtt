from your point of view did you see him

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.969 
from your point of view did you see him
really<00:01:22.670> dazed<00:01:22.880> well<00:01:23.630> no<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:23.960> know<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:24.890> my

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
train to come we were slipping and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:26.740 
train to come we were slipping and
hooking

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
hooking

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.450 
hooking
so<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.259> schlep<00:01:27.590> could<00:01:27.740> usually<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:28.070> come<00:01:28.280> to

so the schlep could usually I come to
slip<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.119> get<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.600> that's<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.840> hardest

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
slip and I get in and that's the hardest

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.630 
slip and I get in and that's the hardest
part<00:01:30.259> getting<00:01:30.619> in<00:01:30.710> there<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.220> never<00:01:31.400> do<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
part getting in there and I never do the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.070 
part getting in there and I never do the
punch<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.210> we're<00:01:32.360> practicing<00:01:32.750> least

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
punch and so we're practicing least

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080 
punch and so we're practicing least
absolutely<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:33.560> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
absolutely in it

well<00:02:38.260> nobody<00:02:38.980> gets<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.280> unclean<00:02:39.760> there<00:02:39.940> go

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
well nobody gets to unclean there go

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300 
well nobody gets to unclean there go
regardless<00:02:40.330> who<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:40.810> are<00:02:41.129> but<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.220> know

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
regardless who they are but you know

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.539 
regardless who they are but you know
when<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> referee<00:02:43.709> he<00:02:44.709> had<00:02:44.799> him<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.010> shot<00:02:45.250> it

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
when the referee he had him on a shot it

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.250 
when the referee he had him on a shot it
look<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:45.879> he<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.120> able<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.390> get<00:02:46.569> up<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:47.080> I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
look like he was able to get up but I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.720 
look like he was able to get up but I
guess<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.530> referee<00:02:47.799> calls<00:02:48.099> but<00:02:48.250> he's<00:02:48.370> talking

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
guess the referee calls but he's talking

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.100 
guess the referee calls but he's talking
I<00:02:48.790> didn't<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.180> didn't<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:49.629> he<00:02:49.690> was<00:02:49.780> hurt<00:02:49.930> that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
I didn't I didn't think he was hurt that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.050 
I didn't I didn't think he was hurt that
bad<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.319> know<00:02:50.500> him<00:02:50.769> with<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> clean<00:02:51.190> shot

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
bad I know him with a clean shot

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.090 
bad I know him with a clean shot
speculate<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.140> me<00:02:54.260> how<00:02:54.410> long<00:02:54.650> would<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:54.890> have

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
speculate for me how long would it have

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.860 
speculate for me how long would it have
taken<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:56.000> them<00:02:56.120> down<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.360> second<00:02:56.840> time

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
taken you to get them down a second time

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.210 
taken you to get them down a second time
if<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.440> fight<00:02:57.620> went<00:02:57.860> on

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
if the fight went on

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.650 
if the fight went on
oh<00:02:58.250> no<00:02:58.850> problem<00:02:59.150> might<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.360> been<00:02:59.480> all<00:02:59.600> over

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
oh no problem might have been all over

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.270 
oh no problem might have been all over
maybe<00:03:01.200> it's<00:03:01.410> better<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.830> referee<00:03:02.100> did

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
maybe it's better that the referee did

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.260 
maybe it's better that the referee did
stop<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.670> would<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.030> been<00:03:03.120> all<00:03:03.210> over

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
stop you I would have been all over

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.330 
stop you I would have been all over
that's<00:03:04.050> what<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:04.290> most<00:03:04.470> dangerously<00:03:05.130> when<00:03:05.310> I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that's what I'm most dangerously when I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.340 
that's what I'm most dangerously when I
know<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.700> someone<00:03:05.940> hurt<00:03:07.670> for<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> record
