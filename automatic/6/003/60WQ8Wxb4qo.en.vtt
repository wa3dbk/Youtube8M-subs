00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
hundred twenty minutes but to talk about

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
hundred twenty minutes but to talk about
the<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.439> segment<00:01:13.950> first<00:01:14.100> hundred<00:01:14.640> twenty

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
minutes is a very very round number so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.749 
minutes is a very very round number so
first<00:01:16.649> of<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:16.829> we<00:01:16.889> can<00:01:16.979> assume<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.579> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
first of all we can assume it's going to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
first of all we can assume it's going to
be<00:01:17.880> somewhere<00:01:18.270> around<00:01:18.420> 120<00:01:19.350> minutes<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.710> the

pose as opposed to being exactly 120
minutes<00:01:22.079> long<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> aside<00:01:23.100> from<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.340> it's

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
minutes long and aside from that it's

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.059 
minutes long and aside from that it's
possible<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.899> only<00:01:25.079> pencil<00:01:25.499> at<00:01:25.590> 120

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069 
possible that they only pencil at 120

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.319 
possible that they only pencil at 120
minutes<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.429> they<00:01:26.670> wanted<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.999> have<00:01:27.179> at

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.809 
technicality that they say that it's on
the<00:02:55.590> twenty-fifth<00:02:56.040> considering<00:02:56.639> that<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the twenty-fifth considering that the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.670 
the twenty-fifth considering that the
25th<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.359> an<00:02:57.480> officially<00:02:58.109> golden<00:02:58.500> week

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
25th is an officially golden week

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.160 
25th is an officially golden week
however<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.609> contradict<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.269> typically

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
however to contradict that typically

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.080 
however to contradict that typically
movies<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.620> japan<00:03:01.920> are<00:03:02.040> released<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.549> saturday

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
movies in japan are released on saturday

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.940 
movies in japan are released on saturday
so<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.480> probably<00:03:03.720> said<00:03:04.170> golden<00:03:04.590> week<00:03:04.739> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
so they probably said golden week to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
so they probably said golden week to
april<00:03:05.280> 20<00:03:05.579> april<00:03:06.180> 25th<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.840> probably<00:03:07.200> today<00:03:07.379> is

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
april 20 april 25th is probably today is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.319 
april 20 april 25th is probably today is
going<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.709> be<00:03:07.799> even<00:03:08.370> though<00:03:08.609> they<00:03:08.790> said<00:03:09.000> golden

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
going to be even though they said golden

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.490 
going to be even though they said golden
week<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.840> technically<00:03:10.170> golden

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
week and it's not technically golden

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.539 
week and it's not technically golden
week<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.950> something<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.250> keep<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.489> mind

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
week but it is something to keep in mind

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.129 
week but it is something to keep in mind
perhaps<00:03:11.940> they<00:03:12.239> back<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.569> release<00:03:12.690> date<00:03:12.989> up<00:03:13.109> to

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
perhaps they back the release date up to

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.449 
perhaps they back the release date up to
monday<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> beginning<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.159> week<00:03:14.310> or

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.339 
least within a couple days of April 25th
is<00:03:29.940> my<00:03:30.090> guess<00:03:30.329> for<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.599> release<00:03:30.930> date<00:03:31.139> not

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
is my guess for the release date not

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.330 
is my guess for the release date not
one's<00:03:31.500> probably<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:31.949> to<00:03:32.010> stay<00:03:32.069> official

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
one's probably going to stay official

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.119 
one's probably going to stay official
but<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.699> was<00:03:32.790> worth<00:03:32.940> pointing<00:03:33.269> out<00:03:33.419> that

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
but it was worth pointing out that

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.470 
but it was worth pointing out that
possibly<00:03:35.129> not<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.549> they<00:03:35.609> get<00:03:35.730> 120<00:03:36.269> minute

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
possibly not and they get 120 minute

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.059 
possibly not and they get 120 minute
runtime<00:03:36.660> up<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.139> two<00:03:37.290> hours<00:03:37.319> that<00:03:37.769> could<00:03:37.949> be

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
runtime up to two hours that could be

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.710 
runtime up to two hours that could be
insane<00:03:38.669> but<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.060> get<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.299> guys<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.449> little<00:03:39.629> bit

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
insane but to get you guys a little bit

is that I wasn't planning on going that

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.010 
is that I wasn't planning on going that
far<00:04:44.340> since<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.120> pretty<00:04:45.300> exhausting<00:04:45.810> at<00:04:45.900> my

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
far since it's pretty exhausting at my

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.450 
far since it's pretty exhausting at my
age<00:04:46.170> but<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.470> got<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> little<00:04:46.830> carried<00:04:46.950> away<00:04:47.250> so

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
age but I got a little carried away so

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.430 
age but I got a little carried away so
accurate<00:04:48.180> or<00:04:48.330> Yama<00:04:48.540> says<00:04:48.810> he<00:04:48.960> went<00:04:49.140> over<00:04:49.320> the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
accurate or Yama says he went over the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.020 
accurate or Yama says he went over the
top<00:04:49.560> which<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.920> actually<00:04:50.070> take<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.700> a<00:04:50.730> very<00:04:50.970> good

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
top which I actually take is a very good

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.250 
top which I actually take is a very good
sign<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.480> once<00:04:51.630> again<00:04:51.750> I've<00:04:51.960> covered<00:04:52.140> this

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.060 
going to be a whole lot more fighting in
this<00:05:22.020> than<00:05:22.169> there<00:05:22.260> was<00:05:22.380> in<00:05:22.440> battle<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.890> gods

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
this than there was in battle of gods

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.470 
this than there was in battle of gods
which<00:05:23.310> battle<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:23.669> gods<00:05:23.820> could<00:05:24.060> have<00:05:24.180> used<00:05:24.330> a

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
which battle of gods could have used a

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.840 
which battle of gods could have used a
bit<00:05:24.870> more<00:05:24.900> fighting<00:05:25.350> scenes<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.650> suppose<00:05:25.890> it

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
bit more fighting scenes I suppose it

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.250 
bit more fighting scenes I suppose it
also<00:05:27.090> could<00:05:27.210> have<00:05:27.330> used<00:05:27.419> more<00:05:27.540> time<00:05:27.900> which<00:05:28.110> is

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
also could have used more time which is

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.720 
also could have used more time which is
what<00:05:28.410> this<00:05:28.530> movie<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.830> offering<00:05:29.340> us<00:05:29.460> with<00:05:29.700> a

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
what this movie is offering us with a
