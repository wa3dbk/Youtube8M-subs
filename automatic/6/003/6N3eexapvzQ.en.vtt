00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it and didn't get it in the end zone so

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.389 
it and didn't get it in the end zone so
that's<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> motors<00:00:30.570> possibility<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.650> in

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that's not the motors possibility and in

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's not the motors possibility and in
my<00:00:32.610> fault<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.149> time<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.469> something

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
my fault but time there was something

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
my fault but time there was something
that<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.010> thought<00:00:35.190> would<00:00:35.370> work<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> tell

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
that we thought would work it to tell
and<00:00:36.570> obviously<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> didn't<00:00:37.200> work<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.590> two<00:00:37.739> more

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and obviously it didn't work at two more

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
and obviously it didn't work at two more
down<00:00:38.129> stakes<00:00:38.520> cue<00:00:38.790> plays<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.420> didn't
