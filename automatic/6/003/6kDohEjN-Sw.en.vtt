00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends we are on one of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.299
 key features of the future 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.429
 additions warlords of draenor 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.679
 1 and peers k for all was announced 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.449
 specializations that is those classes are straight like 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.520
 paladin which is a mass speck of 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.160
 can use the same ki 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.730
 pie and in order to be or whether all 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.949
 or in a tank or in causing such damage 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.140
 at least there was a concert at the very 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.050
 Actually it is not so because I already 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.000
 did some testing and at least 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.590
 Let's see how it works 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.059
 brighter Spaniards just made this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 speck and if we look at where my 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.460
 quote for example this helmet is green 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.010
 helmet 50 or 75 endurance yes I am now 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.260
 I am tanks what happens if i 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.829
 go to dps specialization if i 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.469
 return in reward 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.750
 will there be any changes on the idea 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.820
 should be but really them now 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.650
 there is no difference between 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 tanks skyfit and timid and equipment 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.390
 the damage specialization here is not 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.159
 appear at least you are now 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.280
 paladin need to note that this is just 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.320
 green helmet and maybe not in it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.960
 this shift function is laid 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.229
 specialization i can imagine that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.740
 if such a feature was claimed 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.320
 for setov maybe it can be your 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.049
 epic sets will get 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 extra bonuses though possible and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.829
 another variant 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.659
 that you still need equipment 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.329
 on the tank but because i suspect so 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.120
 that banks will want to collect this one 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.510
 new feature like this about 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.440
 new star new feature up bonus 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.960
 armor and there will be less need 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.870
 nootropic attack multi strike or what 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.970
 then other things can be self-healing 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.050
 will need i can imagine that 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.149
 maybe now unfortunately there aren't any 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.130
 options to check this 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.910
 assumptions will be possible 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.200
 switch so far between 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.940
 specialization that use force 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 bu specialization which also 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.400
 uses force no difference 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.580
 nope also worth noting that if you 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.600
 look for example at any weapon 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.660
 another thing that is different from 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.670
 current your main characteristic 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.050
 for example intelligence you will see that he 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 dedicated to gray that is not 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.450
 used in this situation but what 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.910
 will be if we ask our mentor 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.880
 you lose 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.489
 our specialization is to change it 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.890
 specialization light let's us 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.420
 use light doctor ready for battle 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.180
 what will happen in this case 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.100
 again we return to this helmet and helmet 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.530
 magically changed its main 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 intelligence characteristic 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.560
 Is all things changing? 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.100
 because if we look at our necks 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.239
 the neck shows that there is still a bonus to 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.660
 power in this way does not change absolutely 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:31.470
 exactly under no circumstances change 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:34.720
 neck does not change cloak does not change weapon 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 left hand by the way now switched 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.709
 how do you see how my drag has become now 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.100
 a shield with intelligence and this somehow became 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.320
 shield to force although it seems it used to be 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.640
 on the contrary, I need to take a moment 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.239
 now will check again 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.000
 switch specifically to see 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.510
 also do not change rings and do not change 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.540
 trinket and see accessories gave a bonus 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.109
 to force and give 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.099
 so here that is you still have to 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:12.370
 collect such rings all this jewelry 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.319
 in order to effectively perform in 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.630
 side role but nonetheless already 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.310
 collection load additional 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.310
 quotes will be much less 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.919
 so once again check if I made a mistake 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.789
 a shield maybe we weren't just right away 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.789
 from wearing this shield with intelligence 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.210
 the power of the attack was just not us nadya 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.280
 cabbage with intelligence not missed when 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.740
 dressing up and so found out 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.410
 weapon nickname cloak ring candy not 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.510
 participate in this whole system i can 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.750
 imagine that the future is our cool sets 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.230
 epic 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.050
 can switch to all three or can 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.100
 be the case with druids at all 4 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.940
 specializations 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.160
 and very curious if it doesn't 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.700
 what happens is how equipment will be divided 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.970
 between specializations because like 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.530
 Now Tampa explain what it is tanks 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.590
 Skye thing how to explain your so 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.690
 how to resolve disputes between now 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.320
 by people who are falling from such 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.110
 equipment is not quite clear not 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.840
 it seems this moment to be somewhat 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.080
 difficult you my friends for today is 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.570
 I continue to explore all the features 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.270
 Draenor I hope your this this video was 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.280
 helpful to you thank you for your attention with 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.280
 you were ult winning
