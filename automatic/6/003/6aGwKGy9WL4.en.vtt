00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 if you like Greek yogurt or want 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.160
 start to consume it you can not miss 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.160
 this video 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.110
 I am lorena romero nutritionist and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.390
 founder of aesthetic nutrition and in 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.480
 this video I'm going to explain to you how you can 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 recognize a good quality yogurt 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.660
 for several years now although with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.850
 much more strength in those last two or 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 three in Greek yogurt has gained quite 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.349
 families in the market by force 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 be a natural food of the present 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.530
 healthy food for being a food that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 have enough benefits for the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 health and all that is very well is more me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 I made a video explaining what 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.579
 watering them really and what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.250
 also its benefits then many 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.469
 commercial brands taking advantage of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 demand that there is about this food have 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.070
 released his new yogurt ration that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.899
 supposedly in different version 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 regularly calling it also Greek yogurt 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.429
 and promoting communication a lot 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.350
 healthier for me this was 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.359
 particularly troubling and that's why 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 that I decided to make this video because I 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 find that many of my patients and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.910
 many people who asked me 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.240
 on this subject I considered that some 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.490
 yogurt brands or rather had no 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.189
 really who makes yogurt 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.860
 it really was a healthy one and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 natural then well that need is 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.689
 who considers it important to be this video 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.270
 to explain how it is that you 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.899
 You can recognize a real yogurt 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.740
 good quality and so you can really 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.380
 benefit you with all the properties 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 that a good mood has the first thing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.250
 you must do is to deny your label but not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.899
 I mean the part of the label does not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 talks to you about calories and their 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.189
 nutritional composition I mean the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.740
 part where he talks about the ingredients 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.860
 this is very important that I review them in 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.229
 detail a story burn should not have more 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 of two or three ingredients is worth saying 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.420
 that you should only have milk in any case 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 milk powder and lactic cultures if 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 they have more ingredients anyway 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.689
 I am I am yogurt that I do not 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.080
 I would recommend because you already have added 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.549
 that are unnecessary as for example in 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.430
 the market of seen that yogurts that 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:14.040
 have milk cream that have sugar 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.970
 that they have guar gum and they even have 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.930
 flour 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.450
 a detail later but none of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.060
 the components must be within a 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.840
 good yogurt these things use them 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.940
 generally to improve the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 consistency and improve 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.830
 organoleptic characteristics of 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.960
 food if this is necessary to do 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.390
 means that it is not a product of 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.670
 first quality then remember that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.770
 you should only have in your composition milk 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.200
 in two cases milk powder and crops 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.360
 elastic the second point to have in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.000
 mind is that yogurt can not have 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.490
 an expiration date greater than one month 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.830
 from its date of manufacture the yogurt is 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.360
 a dairy product and as such can not 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.330
 have an expiration date so 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.040
 extensive if it is like that means that it has 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.050
 preservatives and preservatives what 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.760
 does not so natural and rather pretty 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.280
 the processed so neither what 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.990
 I would also recommend the yogurt 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.340
 it must be kept refrigerated 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.080
 if on the label or in the propaganda 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.360
 says that yogurt does not need 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.260
 refrigeration, it definitely has 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.540
 a lot 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.459
 of preservatives that definitely do not 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 They are unhealthy for the following 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.569
 important that you should take into account are 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.849
 two things its amount of bacteria and that 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.650
 do not contain gluten ok the subject of the 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.470
 Bacteria quantity is a pretty subject 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.360
 technical and that our information that is 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.980
 it comes directly to the consumer but 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.989
 do not worry, you want to explain more or 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.430
 less how can you tell what 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.860
 important with the issue of bacteria 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.260
 is that the main benefit of a 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.720
 yogurt is that you have bacteria that are 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.930
 beneficial to us mainly 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.790
 the family of lactobacilli then yes 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.159
 a yogurt 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.139
 does not have a bacterial amount 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.019
 definitely enough 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.819
 benefits that are for us are going to 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.980
 be of course much less the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.870
 problem with many commercial yoghurts 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.569
 is that they do not meet the requirement 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.220
 minimum amount of bacteria that 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.230
 I should have a real me 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.269
 unfortunately that is information that 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.690
 it does not get on the label it's never going to 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.540
 know what he tells us so much 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.310
 but it is important 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.480
 but there are certain characteristics 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.340
 that let you realize if 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.020
 truly has the amount of 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.300
 Athenas who says he has the first 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.240
 characteristic although not so exact is 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.400
 the consistency of the yogurt the yogurt should 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.840
 be thick which means that the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.600
 Liquid yogurts do not have the amount 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.940
 minimum of bacteria and have not gone through 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.250
 the minimum fermentation process that 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.440
 makes this yogurt have that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.640
 characteristic but eye remembers that 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.860
 this feature is not entirely 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.780
 precise because many osca yogurt 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.660
 martial who do not comply with this 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.060
 thickness requirement what they do is 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.550
 add another type of ingredients to 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.160
 to be able to achieve that consistency, call 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.130
 Flours and other types of starch or even 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.110
 guar gum then achieve the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.180
 consistency of yogurt but through 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.160
 a product alteration 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.320
 adding ingredients that should not 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.480
 have that's where the point comes in 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.030
 important that I was telling you that a 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.800
 Yogurt should not contain gluten 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.230
 how your dairy product we know that the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.720
 milk does not have gluten but many 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.030
 yogurts if they have it for that reason 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.880
 because they add flour to other starch 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.590
 things to achieve that consistency already 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.900
 the latter if you can realize the 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.960
 tag should check it to see if it says 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.730
 guar gum or flours or starches 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.740
 Modified starches or any 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.470
 term that refers to carbohydrates 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.530
 if he says that means he has 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.790
 some those ideals in their composition 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.350
 mainly to thicken the the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.120
 you can transform the account 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.610
 If you have a good amount of bacteria 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.740
 is doing a little experiment if you 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.420
 you play yogurt from 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.400
 commercial yogurt suddenly you're 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.040
 doubting that I have a couple of 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.810
 bacteria if you three of reproducible 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.880
 hotels realize that I'm not going to 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.560
 leave yogurt then that means 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.030
 that does not have a quantity but 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.160
 enough although I probably have 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.530
 the dead bacteria then gave by 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.630
 there you set the account only with a good 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.090
 because it has a good amount great 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.160
 you are going to be able to reproduce and do 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.720
 married given in the last year in the 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.270
 Lima market entered 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.400
 and more brands promoting their version of 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.080
 Greek yogurt but that really I what 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.670
 I think it's not healthy at all 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.950
 I think it's important to mention a 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.050
 norm that if I consider it healthy and if 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.780
 I would recommend that you consume it 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.490
 the brand of yogurt alonso alonso 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.100
 You can find this in 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.170
 supermarkets like a metro and even in 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.580
 coffee shops like san antonio the 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.830
 information where you can find it is 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.020
 I'll put it in the description here 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.880
 down but I'll tell you what I like is 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.890
 yogurt are several things first that 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.900
 your ingredients you are going to see only has 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.120
 whole milk milk powder without crops 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.130
 lactic and the fourth ingredient would come 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.720
 to be the honey that comes here separated into 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.830
 this case the bee's good 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.530
 then you can calmly 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.910
 consume in me a single or can you 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.320
 regulate the amount of candy that you 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.570
 you add then for me that seems to me 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.070
 excellent because you do not necessarily go to 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.320
 have to put the whole amount of 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.460
 honey that comes here but you regulate the 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.250
 amount of candy that you like 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.980
 I do not know if they can see but 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.840
 it's a pretty thick yogurt what 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.640
 it means that you really have the 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.800
 consistency of a true yogurt is 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.060
 a yogurt that does not have specific gluten 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.870
 that does not have 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:33.300
 and nani guar gum much less any 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.250
 other type of starch or modified starch 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.770
 and additional that does not have preservatives 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.440
 nor preservatives then it really is 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.460
 a good yogurt brand 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.440
 unfortunately this yogurt just what 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.180
 sold in Lima but I'm sure that with 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.860
 the information that you gave in this video
