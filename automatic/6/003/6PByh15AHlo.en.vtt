00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and all when taking into account themselves will be about 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.879
 Welcome to the game offline 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.960
 say the train simulator is not like something 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.150
 in the likeness of this 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.519
 7 do not even know but it is not quite 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 Usually Sinatra metro guys and so we 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.220
 there is a small booth 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.020
 we have a lot of our driver 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 different switches that respond and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.980
 I do not even know what for let's understand 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.350
 quietly so these buttons can 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.240
 press closing these buttons they 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.910
 show us completely different whales 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.599
 eyes from different angles I do not know why 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.450
 it is necessary 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.670
 night for example included in the eye so 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.510
 it makes taste hold what kind of what 6 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.789
 what it does and the light the higher light is better 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 light well i like it and it 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:59.420
 do nothing well i understood it dad 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.420
 Wow interestingly connects color 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.770
 this is something that sets up this miracle 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.450
 adjusts it so that light is still 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.610
 more light well 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.140
 it still connects color by 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.400
 moment like fun turns out yes 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.580
 guys so someone is whispering to us 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.510
 bitch 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.430
 saw later arm here arm here arm 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.930
 was and that was all you were here the same 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.930
 crap this same freaking spirit you 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.259
 watch your hands everywhere on the car on the glass 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.259
 and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.900
 what's this 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.910
 this is sound 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.640
 I'll help this okay guys Obama pairs to me 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:02.980
 it seems to go and the fact that yes it is it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.650
 it is clear that this is some kind of 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.040
 garbage incomprehensibly okay well and drive 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.650
 Threesomes, let's Slowly Leave 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:17.050
 let's see what's what this so far we 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:21.120
 speed let's magnitude something 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.550
 happens a little starts to happen 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.569
 some sounds 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.340
 what 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.370
 what sounds incomprehensible as if de 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.150
 tous same hands motives look here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.900
 a lot of hands and well, there is still faster and more 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.310
 look more ok i am an essay 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.739
 do such a thing to do it appreciate her 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.590
 hooked up and now drink here on 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.490
 permanent and not so fast 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.770
 gone as I thought how well 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.450
 she piled up 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.270
 they don't want to pair cool guys 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.020
 you look like metro 2033 remember this too 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.110
 similar 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.990
 again these hands what do i do with it 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.500
 and what all is something I can do about it 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.500
 or not 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.430
 Yes, it's creepy as well as just yolk 6 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.790
 just mad someone subway and all 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.790
 converges 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.280
 what a horror 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.920
 Tin guys they feel like I'm 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.970
 just eating youtube without any of it 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.510
 nowhere 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.810
 my demise I'm going 6 what is this city looking for 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.810
 this 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:44.890
 Why this thing I do not understand incomprehensible 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.440
 also what is this thing for ? 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.290
 what am i doing here why is that train going 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.410
 and why are these hands here 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.480
 here and why I donâ€™t understand 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.480
 I do not understand anything well if such a network 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.819
 so even tougher 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.000
 it would be better to include everything all honest 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.000
 word 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.020
 damn ok 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.879
 hello you don't know what to do 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.959
 not present only one and create 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.959
 chicken taste to the limit 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.850
 more terrible stop 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.830
 eaten them just watering and she played terribly 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.750
 will inevitably prove what was just sending 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.750
 there our places hands passed 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.640
 wait are gone 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:47.810
 close 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:53.770
 Wow, this gg is also a brake 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.770
 really turns off everything okay 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.210
 let's take speed 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.680
 I'm shorter than the floor that you need to be cut in this 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.680
 thing probably 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.690
 let be 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.169
 the battle 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:21.599
 Oh 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:26.099
 oh oh there charge and remember too train 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:28.919
 it was guys yes no yes no neither yes nor me 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.129
 difficulty I do not know what to say well yes 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.779
 so I removed the search to the maximum I will give 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.439
 maxim failure the search is obtained so 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:40.340
 there is a campaign if I drive away to the maximum and 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.410
 also somewhere searching like her 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.969
 so I understand this set that were 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.720
 swept away by rome 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:54.910
 he dumped 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:06:02.110
 Samms rollers and the rapier came I did 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:04.000
 I know the same is here so damn funny 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.830
 in short guys I can hardly understand why 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.250
 game was created but I liked it 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.110
 really like it you know what experience 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.550
 some such here its mystique 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.120
 mysticism mysticism somehow 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.980
 incomprehensible to 100 she is not understandable 2 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.080
 projectile very incomprehensible I immediately 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.420
 you know what's going on at all 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.190
 really cool so here's such 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.500
 toy, I decided that you might be 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.330
 interesting to see from so put 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.520
