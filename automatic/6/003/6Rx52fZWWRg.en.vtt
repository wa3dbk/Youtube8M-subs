hello today I'm showing off my cute

little Minolta minutina ALS it's a

little Minolta minutina ALS it's a
rangefinder<00:00:11.190> camera<00:00:12.120> made<00:00:12.389> by<00:00:12.420> Minolta<00:00:13.410> in

rangefinder camera made by Minolta in

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.689 
rangefinder camera made by Minolta in
the<00:00:13.790> 1960s<00:00:15.139> I<00:00:16.139> believe<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.980> would<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.490> been<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the 1960s I believe it would have been a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.050 
the 1960s I believe it would have been a
precursor<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> high<00:00:19.350> Matic<00:00:19.800> line<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
precursor to the high Matic line the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.230 
precursor to the high Matic line the
world<00:00:21.600> renowned<00:00:22.170> high<00:00:22.560> Mattox<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.699> me<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.119> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
world renowned high Mattox to me it is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.589 
world renowned high Mattox to me it is
on<00:00:24.539> par<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:24.990> those<00:00:25.880> because<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.029> does<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
on par with those because it does have a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.979 
on par with those because it does have a
super-fast<00:00:28.590> lens<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.929> 1.8<00:00:30.980> which<00:00:31.980> in

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
super-fast lens it's a 1.8 which in

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
super-fast lens it's a 1.8 which in
consumer<00:00:33.989> rangefinder<00:00:34.829> models<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
consumer rangefinder models like this a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010 
consumer rangefinder models like this a
two<00:00:37.170> point<00:00:37.469> eight<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:38.160> higher<00:00:38.629> f-stop<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
two point eight or higher f-stop was the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.940 
two point eight or higher f-stop was the
norm<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.980> anything<00:00:41.460> under<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:42.120> F<00:00:42.270> 2<00:00:42.950> was

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
norm so anything under an F 2 was

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.340 
norm so anything under an F 2 was
considered<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.820> higher<00:00:45.360> end<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
considered the higher end because it

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.959 
considered the higher end because it
could<00:00:46.559> shoot<00:00:46.890> under<00:00:47.460> lower<00:00:47.670> light<00:00:47.940> conditions

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
could shoot under lower light conditions

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.959 
could shoot under lower light conditions
and<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> nice<00:00:49.250> short<00:00:50.250> depth<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.730> field

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and have a nice short depth of field

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
and have a nice short depth of field
giving<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> very<00:00:51.719> professional<00:00:52.649> sort<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> look

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
giving a very professional sort of look

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.330 
giving a very professional sort of look
to<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> images<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> 35<00:00:55.710> millimeter<00:00:56.250> film

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
to the images it's a 35 millimeter film

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.099 
to the images it's a 35 millimeter film
format<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.949> received<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.210> I<00:01:00.210> believe<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.930> was

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
format I received it I believe this was

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.700 
format I received it I believe this was
an<00:01:01.199> eBay<00:01:01.500> purchase<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> meter<00:01:03.809> was

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
an eBay purchase the meter was

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
an eBay purchase the meter was
functioning<00:01:05.280> fine<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> selenium<00:01:06.210> meter

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
functioning fine it's a selenium meter

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.560 
functioning fine it's a selenium meter
so<00:01:07.140> there's<00:01:07.290> no<00:01:07.500> batteries<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.570> involved

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
so there's no batteries at all involved

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
so there's no batteries at all involved
in<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.780> camera<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.500> great<00:01:10.830> there's<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
in this camera which is great there's a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
in this camera which is great there's a
certain<00:01:11.490> freedom<00:01:11.729> involved<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.890> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
certain freedom involved there but I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
certain freedom involved there but I
don't<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.460> how<00:01:14.670> long<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.030> last<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.630> we

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
don't know how long they last so we

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.499 
don't know how long they last so we
shall<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.710> radioactive<00:01:17.070> material

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
shall see it's a radioactive material

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
shall see it's a radioactive material
just<00:01:18.509> fabulous<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.530> confusing<00:01:20.400> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
just fabulous that I'm confusing this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
just fabulous that I'm confusing this

and putting up up against my face to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
and putting up up against my face to
shoot<00:01:22.890> pictures<00:01:23.180> always<00:01:24.180> wondered<00:01:24.479> about

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
shoot pictures always wondered about

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.399 
shoot pictures always wondered about
that<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:26.090> nice<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.119> camera<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that but a nice little camera it's a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.179 
that but a nice little camera it's a
it's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> great<00:01:28.799> size<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.790> small<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:31.829> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's a great size it's very small it is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.330 
it's a great size it's very small it is
equal<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.360> consider<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.009> size<00:01:35.009> wise

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
equal to I would consider it size wise

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
equal to I would consider it size wise

there's no batteries no anything down

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.749 
there's no batteries no anything down

condition<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> original<00:01:51.990> case<00:01:52.290> which

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
condition with the original case which

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.039 
condition with the original case which
was<00:01:52.770> very<00:01:53.130> good<00:01:53.369> condition<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.570> original

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
was very good condition the original

was very good condition the original
lens<00:01:55.259> cap<00:01:55.619> which<00:01:55.979> says<00:01:56.219> Minolta<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
lens cap which says Minolta on it and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.440 
lens cap which says Minolta on it and
then<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.610> bottom<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
then on the bottom here there was a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
then on the bottom here there was a
little<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> scuffing<00:02:01.380> around<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:01.890> which

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
little bit of scuffing around here which

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
little bit of scuffing around here which
is<00:02:02.159> normal<00:02:02.640> around<00:02:03.270> where<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> tripod<00:02:04.170> mount

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
is normal around where the tripod mount

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.449 
is normal around where the tripod mount
is<00:02:05.329> then<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> back<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.110> nice<00:02:07.530> AAS<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
is then on the back we have nice AAS a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.290 
is then on the back we have nice AAS a
and<00:02:08.729> din<00:02:09.739> conversions<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.550> i

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and din conversions which at the time i

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.910 
and din conversions which at the time i
think<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:12.989> were<00:02:13.050> using<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
think they were using the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.339 
think they were using the
in<00:02:14.220> numbers<00:02:14.730> instead<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.020> might<00:02:16.230> have

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
in numbers instead so this might have

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.729 
in numbers instead so this might have
been<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.500> transition<00:02:17.040> period<00:02:17.670> between<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.060> two

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
been a transition period between the two

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.800 
been a transition period between the two
ASAS<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.040> more<00:02:20.340> what's<00:02:20.610> used<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.480> point

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
ASAS a is more what's used at this point

ASAS a is more what's used at this point
in<00:02:21.930> time<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:25.010> meter<00:02:26.010> read

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
in time up here you have the meter read

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.990 
in time up here you have the meter read
out<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.720> needle<00:02:28.170> does<00:02:28.890> move<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.760> down

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
out so this needle does move up and down

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.180 
out so this needle does move up and down
depending<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.870> what<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.470> meter<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.830> seeing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
depending on what this meter is seeing

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.309 
depending on what this meter is seeing
you<00:02:32.760> see<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.060> moving<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.450> little<00:02:33.630> bit<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:34.110> now

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
you see it moving a little bit right now

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.620 
you see it moving a little bit right now
not<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> whole<00:02:35.100> lot<00:02:35.400> since<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:35.819> endorse<00:02:36.239> so

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
not a whole lot since I'm endorse so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.809 
not a whole lot since I'm endorse so
there's<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.989> lot<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.550> ambient<00:02:38.550> light<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
there's not a lot of ambient light to

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.620 
there's not a lot of ambient light to
set<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.239> off

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
set it off

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.630 
set it off
I<00:02:39.660> found<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.319> metering<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.190> pretty

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
I found the metering on it is pretty

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.910 
I found the metering on it is pretty
accurate<00:02:41.910> I've<00:02:42.450> gotten<00:02:42.750> some<00:02:42.959> nice<00:02:43.170> exposures

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
accurate I've gotten some nice exposures

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.940 
accurate I've gotten some nice exposures
really<00:02:44.340> nice<00:02:44.489> images<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.180> it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
really nice images with it

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.820 
really nice images with it
and<00:02:47.459> then<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.269> an<00:02:48.810> accessory<00:02:49.350> slash

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

recommend it it is pretty much something

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.830 
recommend it it is pretty much something
a<00:03:53.370> lot<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.880> people<00:03:54.090> don't<00:03:54.180> know<00:03:54.450> about

a lot of people don't know about
I<00:03:55.049> guess<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.530> middle<00:03:55.680> Tina<00:03:56.040> line<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.640> was<00:03:56.790> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
I guess the middle Tina line there was a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.430 
I guess the middle Tina line there was a
P<00:03:57.959> version<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.980> believe<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.459> was<00:03:59.609> that<00:04:00.260> was<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
P version I believe it was that was the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.170 
P version I believe it was that was the
2.8<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.910> slower<00:04:03.390> lens<00:04:04.069> I<00:04:05.069> believe<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:05.970> was

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
2.8 the slower lens I believe this was

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.360 
2.8 the slower lens I believe this was
the<00:04:06.209> only<00:04:06.450> middle<00:04:06.989> Tina<00:04:07.230> model<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.859> had<00:04:08.130> this

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
the only middle Tina model that had this

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.550 
the only middle Tina model that had this
fast<00:04:08.730> lens<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.359> there<00:04:09.959> might<00:04:10.260> have<00:04:10.290> only

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
fast lens on it there might have only

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.530 
fast lens on it there might have only
been<00:04:10.859> two<00:04:11.190> or<00:04:11.370> three<00:04:11.639> in<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.910> middle<00:04:12.120> Tina

camera since they are not as well known
they're<00:04:22.919> very<00:04:23.700> undervalued<00:04:24.090> on<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.810> used

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
they're very undervalued on the used

so this one on eBay I got in a lot of
three<00:04:28.919> rangefinders<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.759> believe<00:04:30.060> for<00:04:30.210> $30<00:04:30.840> so

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
three rangefinders I believe for $30 so

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.320 
three rangefinders I believe for $30 so
I<00:04:31.020> basically<00:04:31.229> paid<00:04:31.680> $10<00:04:32.250> for<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.300> only

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
I basically paid $10 for it the only

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.840 
I basically paid $10 for it the only
issue<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.900> had<00:04:34.199> with<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.440> was<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.460> shutter

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850

issue I had with it was that the shutter
was<00:04:36.150> stuck<00:04:36.590> but<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:38.130> assembly<00:04:39.090> is<00:04:39.270> very<00:04:39.630> easy

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
was stuck but this assembly is very easy

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.170

just take out one piece at a time until

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.529 
just take out one piece at a time until

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
you get to the shutter blades and I put

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.749 
you get to the shutter blades and I put
a<00:04:48.570> little<00:04:48.750> lighter<00:04:49.020> fluid<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.680> she<00:04:50.580> ran

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
a little lighter fluid and she ran

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.529 
a little lighter fluid and she ran
perfectly<00:04:50.970> from<00:04:51.509> there<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:53.000> may<00:04:54.000> have<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.330> do<00:04:54.449> it

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
perfectly from there I may have to do it

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:55.999 
perfectly from there I may have to do it
again<00:04:54.720> in<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.960> future<00:04:55.110> because<00:04:55.320> even<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.889> this

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
again in the future because even in this

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.610 
again in the future because even in this
light<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.610> see<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.270> there<00:04:57.810> little<00:04:58.080> residue

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
light I can see in there little residue

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.529 
light I can see in there little residue
on<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.070> blades<00:04:59.340> so<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.669> might<00:05:00.000> have<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.210> do<00:05:00.389> it

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
on the blades so I might have to do it

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.570 
on the blades so I might have to do it
again<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.900> future<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.500> she's<00:05:02.100> run<00:05:02.340> great

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
again in the future but she's run great

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.360 
again in the future but she's run great
until<00:05:02.940> now<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:03.710> my<00:05:04.710> lovely<00:05:05.090> little<00:05:06.090> Tina
