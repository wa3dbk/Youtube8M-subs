going<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.170> trigger<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.920> little<00:00:05.640> wave<00:00:05.790> of

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
going to trigger a little wave of

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.629 
going to trigger a little wave of
scorpions<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.810> then<00:00:07.410> after<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.400> big

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
scorpions and then after that the big

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.140 
scorpions and then after that the big
scorpion<00:00:08.940> boss<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.630> going<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.990> come<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:10.290> and

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
scorpion boss is going to come out and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
scorpion boss is going to come out and
one<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.300> reasons<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.900> boss<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.559> tough

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
one of the reasons this boss is so tough

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.900 
one of the reasons this boss is so tough
is<00:00:14.160> because<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.509> lack<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.900> checkpoints

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
is because of the lack of checkpoints

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.500 
is because of the lack of checkpoints
there's<00:00:17.910> basically<00:00:18.240> no<00:00:18.480> checkpoints<00:00:19.850> okay<00:00:20.850> so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
there's basically no checkpoints okay so

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
there's basically no checkpoints okay so
well<00:00:21.840> okay<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.529> kill<00:00:22.740> these<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.160> wave

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
well okay so you kill these first wave

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
well okay so you kill these first wave
of<00:00:23.400> scorpions<00:00:24.090> very<00:00:24.840> easy<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
of scorpions very easy but the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
of scorpions very easy but the
checkpoint<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.250> after<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> wave<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
checkpoint is after this wave of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390 
checkpoint is after this wave of
scorpions<00:00:27.510> okay<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.650> still<00:00:28.920> quite<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
scorpions okay but it's still quite a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
scorpions okay but it's still quite a
ways<00:00:31.610> that<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:33.090> without<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
ways that you have to go without a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.540 
ways that you have to go without a
checkpoint<00:00:33.710> now<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.100> reason<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
checkpoint now the reason you have to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.770 
checkpoint now the reason you have to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
what I like to do is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.209

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
you do get a checkpoint because there's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.640 
you do get a checkpoint because there's
like<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.400> little<00:04:43.930> quick<00:04:44.930> time<00:04:45.139> event<00:04:45.440> thing
