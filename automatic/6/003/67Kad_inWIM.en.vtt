00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the key of G the G chord is where my bar

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
the key of G the G chord is where my bar
finger<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.930> there's<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.050> G<00:00:40.469> bar<00:00:40.969> if<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.120> was

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
finger is so there's a G bar if I was

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.349 
finger is so there's a G bar if I was
playing<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> key<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.250> A<00:00:44.489> bar

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
playing in the key of a there's an A bar

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.099 
playing in the key of a there's an A bar
wherever<00:00:47.170> my<00:00:47.320> index<00:00:48.309> finger<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.909> that's<00:00:49.780> the

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
wherever my index finger is that's the

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.450 
wherever my index finger is that's the
cord<00:00:50.469> or<00:00:50.890> that's<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.640> root<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:53.170> song<00:00:53.460> so

cord or that's the root of the song so

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.009 
cord or that's the root of the song so
let's<00:00:54.640> say<00:00:54.820> we're<00:00:55.000> playing<00:00:55.149> in<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.539> key<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.899> a

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
let's say we're playing in the key of a

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.709 
let's say we're playing in the key of a
there's<00:00:56.589> my<00:00:56.769> eight<00:00:56.979> if<00:00:57.969> I<00:00:58.120> have<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.420> play<00:00:58.690> a

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
there's my eight if I have to play a

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.889 
there's my eight if I have to play a
lead<00:00:59.079> over<00:00:59.469> that<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.820> also<00:01:01.210> tells<00:01:01.479> me<00:01:01.600> where

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
lead over that that also tells me where

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.330 
lead over that that also tells me where
to<00:01:01.929> start<00:01:02.320> my<00:01:02.469> finger<00:01:02.890> which<00:01:03.309> is<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.809> and

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
to start my finger which is there and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.620 
to start my finger which is there and
this<00:01:06.340> pentatonic<00:01:07.330> scale<00:01:07.689> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:09.340> finger<00:01:10.180> there

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
this pentatonic scale is a finger there

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.120 
this pentatonic scale is a finger there
and<00:01:11.320> then<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.710> should<00:01:11.950> go<00:01:12.220> up<00:01:12.399> three<00:01:13.000> frets

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and then you should go up three frets

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.919 
and then you should go up three frets
then<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.280> move<00:01:15.429> over<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.000> next<00:01:16.119> string

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.590 

skip<00:01:19.929> a<00:01:19.960> fret<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.759> same<00:01:22.030> thing<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.479> next

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
skip a fret the same thing on the next

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.139 
skip a fret the same thing on the next
string<00:01:24.179> same<00:01:25.179> thing<00:01:25.420> on<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.630> next<00:01:25.750> string<00:01:27.149> and

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
string same thing on the next string and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.230 
string same thing on the next string and
then<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.569> following<00:01:29.080> string<00:01:30.240> you're

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
then on the following string you're

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.930 
then on the following string you're
skipping<00:01:31.509> two<00:01:31.840> frets<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.440> on<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.549> highest

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
skipping two frets and on the highest

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.180 
skipping two frets and on the highest
string<00:01:34.209> speak<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.409> friends<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.299> basically

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
string speak to friends so basically

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.550 
string speak to friends so basically
everything<00:01:39.299> starts<00:01:40.299> on<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:40.600> fret<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.200> then

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
everything starts on this fret and then

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.050 
everything starts on this fret and then
you're<00:01:41.709> either<00:01:41.799> putting<00:01:42.190> your<00:01:42.280> finger<00:01:42.640> here

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
you're either putting your finger here

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.910 
you're either putting your finger here
or<00:01:43.959> here<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.119> look<00:01:46.360> on<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:47.500> lowest

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
or here and if I look on this lowest

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.190 
or here and if I look on this lowest
string<00:01:48.220> it's<00:01:48.670> there<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.929> next

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
string it's there and then the next

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400 
string it's there and then the next
three<00:01:50.349> in<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.590> row<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.599> then<00:01:53.319> the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
three in a row is there and then the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.790 
three in a row is there and then the
last<00:01:53.649> two<00:01:54.009> strings<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.819> skip<00:01:55.720> again<00:01:56.050> so<00:01:56.590> it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
last two strings I skip again so it's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.740 
last two strings I skip again so it's
like<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.160> lowest<00:01:57.489> string<00:01:57.640> here<00:01:58.239> and<00:01:58.390> here<00:01:58.629> and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
like the lowest string here and here and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.629 
like the lowest string here and here and
that<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.679> pentatonic<00:02:00.129> scale<00:02:00.940> pattern
