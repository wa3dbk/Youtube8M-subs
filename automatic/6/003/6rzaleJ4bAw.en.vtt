where the film goes you see here in the
back<00:01:07.020> there's<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:08.960> trapdoor<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
back there's a little trapdoor that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.550 
back there's a little trapdoor that
flips<00:01:10.590> open<00:01:11.630> your<00:01:12.630> film<00:01:12.960> goes<00:01:13.250> right<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.400> here

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:31.450 

pull<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> across<00:01:25.430> find<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> slot<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.260 

and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:34.080> way<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.350> camera<00:01:34.770> fires<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and then the way this camera fires is it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.590 
and then the way this camera fires is it
has<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.660> lever<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.440> loads<00:01:38.480> advances<00:01:39.480> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
has one lever that loads advances the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
has one lever that loads advances the
film<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.290> also<00:01:40.440> serves<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.010> Shire

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
film and then also serves the Shire

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.030 
film and then also serves the Shire
there's<00:01:41.730> a<00:01:41.820> shutter<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:43.440> then<00:01:43.620> we<00:01:43.710> advance

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there's a shutter and then we advance

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.610 
there's a shutter and then we advance
the<00:01:44.250> film<00:01:46.580> make<00:01:47.580> sure<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.300> now<00:01:49.200> so
