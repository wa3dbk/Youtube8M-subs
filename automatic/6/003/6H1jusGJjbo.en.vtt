so<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:47.420> same<00:01:47.630> with<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.900> other<00:01:47.990> side<00:01:48.080> over

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
so the same with the other side over

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.030 
so the same with the other side over
there<00:01:49.510> but<00:01:50.510> I'm<00:01:50.720> not<00:01:50.870> going<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:51.440> side<00:01:51.710> today

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
there but I'm not going that side today

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.820 
there but I'm not going that side today
so<00:01:52.780> same<00:01:53.780> content<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:55.640> just<00:01:55.850> over<00:01:56.090> there<00:01:56.830> pull

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
so same content you just over there pull

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.710 
so same content you just over there pull
out<00:01:57.980> that<00:01:58.570> green<00:01:59.570> handle<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.120> just<00:02:02.450> put<00:02:02.630> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
out that green handle and I just put it

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.900 
out that green handle and I just put it
there<00:02:05.620> but<00:02:06.760> get<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.910> job<00:02:08.119> done<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.990> then

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
there but get the job done so and then

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.490 
there but get the job done so and then
when<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.000> goes<00:02:14.150> up<00:02:14.210> all<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> way<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> me<00:02:15.290> just

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
when it goes up all the way to me just

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.210 
when it goes up all the way to me just
like<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.650> car

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
like a car

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.890 
like a car
this<00:02:16.670> pops<00:02:17.050> stops<00:02:18.050> fuelling<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.490> I'm<00:02:20.480> assuming

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
this pops stops fuelling so I'm assuming

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.420 
this pops stops fuelling so I'm assuming
this<00:02:21.020> wire<00:02:21.320> right<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:21.800> when<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:21.980> reaches<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
this wire right here when it reaches the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.020 
this wire right here when it reaches the
wire<00:02:22.610> cuts<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:26.620> right<00:02:27.620> here<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:29.000> have

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
wire cuts it out right here you have

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.980 
wire cuts it out right here you have
your<00:02:29.150> gallons<00:02:29.750> sale<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:32.080> maybe<00:02:34.690> it's<00:02:35.690> moving

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
your gallons sale so maybe it's moving

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.970 
your gallons sale so maybe it's moving
too<00:02:36.110> fast<00:02:36.320> but<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> idea

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.970 

then<00:02:42.980> when<00:02:43.130> we're<00:02:43.280> done<00:02:43.310> here

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
then when we're done here

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.710 
then when we're done here
and<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.100> receipt<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:47.000> once<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.300> giving<00:02:47.570> up

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and the receipt so once you giving up

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.420 
and the receipt so once you giving up
you<00:02:47.870> go<00:02:48.020> inside<00:02:48.200> whatever<00:02:48.739> pump<00:02:49.130> you're<00:02:49.310> on

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you go inside whatever pump you're on

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.490 
you go inside whatever pump you're on
you<00:02:50.090> don't<00:02:50.330> proceed<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.840> pump<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:52.040> then

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
you don't proceed on pump and then

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.310 
you don't proceed on pump and then
for<00:02:54.070> example<00:02:54.460> for<00:02:54.640> me<00:02:54.760> pomp<00:02:55.330> 1<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.020> go<00:02:56.230> in

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
for example for me pomp 1 so I go in

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.590 
for example for me pomp 1 so I go in
there<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.890> tell<00:02:57.280> pump<00:02:57.550> 1<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:58.330> printed

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
there and then I tell pump 1 get printed

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.410 
there and then I tell pump 1 get printed
out<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.930> they<00:02:59.050> give<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.380> me<00:02:59.820> for<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.000> they

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
out and they give it to me for it they

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.910 
out and they give it to me for it they
get<00:03:01.570> their<00:03:01.780> copy<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.470> mine<00:03:02.680> and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
get their copy I get mine and

snowstorm<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.220> think<00:03:38.030> storm<00:03:38.740> sandstorm<00:03:43.630> this

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
snowstorm I think storm sandstorm this

00:03:44.630 --> 00:04:18.849 
snowstorm I think storm sandstorm this
is<00:04:05.440> also<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:17.660> because<00:04:17.840> when<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.260> get<00:04:18.440> my<00:04:18.709> fuel

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
is also just because when I get my fuel

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:27.560 
is also just because when I get my fuel
spot<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.720> jump<00:04:20.720> out<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.080> fast
