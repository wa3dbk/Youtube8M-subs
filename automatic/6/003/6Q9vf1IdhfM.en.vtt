00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.790
 here we are in Ponte Valtellina today 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:11.030
 on January 18th 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.959
 we are in a quarry and begin to prune 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.100
 blueberry plants this is a variety 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.800
 which is called duke at 5 years old is raised 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.760
 he produced a lot in the tub 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.420
 last year is well fed and has a good 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.970
 equilibrium 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.580
 begin to remove the central branches 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.320
 because we have to make sure he has 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.660
 light inside the breeding is one 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.980
 form we say quite spontaneously but 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.399
 all in all and in blueberry pot 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.810
 needs renovation 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.550
 absolutely eliminate all the part 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.620
 aged that in the end is what it has 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.960
 produced last year and must 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.580
 continually renew now let's move on 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.700
 with finishing cuts basically 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:16.100
 the base is eliminated except for some bolts 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:19.970
 and it can serve us for a cry 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.799
 food in this case is checked yes 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.799
 eliminates all the old that has produced 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.409
 I am sure you must be satisfied 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.780
 back outwards they pop up 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.970
 at the top to call some wood 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.260
 new and at the same time make a 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.840
 thinning the fruit is produced 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.710
 all on the terminal part of the shoots 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:55.299
 new a little like peach if you can do it 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:02.509
 a comparison is now over cleans up 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:06.250
 up to the base there is a verification as follows 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.250
 this aged 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.450
 another cut to call a little 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.560
 of new wind 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.560
 this plant is carried
