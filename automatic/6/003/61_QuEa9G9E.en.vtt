00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.299
 [Applause] 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.340
 if we go ahead with awareness 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.019
 that this is an important time of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.610
 knowledge work 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.030
 let's try to insert new ones 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.100
 bring them to a degree of attention of di 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.920
 steady growth even though it is still there 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.480
 so much to do, however 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.270
 we will approach the championship 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 gradually to try to have one 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.230
 good condition that allows us in short 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.120
 to be able to give and do services already 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.559
 right that after 15 days of work not 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 is that we can think of being of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 therefore, everything has already been achieved 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.830
 now we will accelerate a little in the next ones 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 weeks in terms of speed 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.870
 of speed because it is clear that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 distances have been until now 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.590
 important heavy loads then 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 we'll go a little downhill below 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 the aspect of speed 9 the company the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.489
 president are working to take 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.409
 still something so we know which ones 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.089
 the needs may be short 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.210
 we are evaluating the opportunity to be able to 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.340
 take a striker but if it does 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 we will find opportunities and benefits 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.750
 otherwise we will remain so we are 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.780
 keeping monitoring and keeping below 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.360
 observation in some then negotiations 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.760
 he is carrying them on 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.770
 the company the president therefore us 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 we remain focused on the work that it is 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.120
 what matters most in this 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.040
 moment then regardless of whom 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.350
 will definitely be guys who will 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.820
 they will be able to integrate the profile 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670
 just to integrate as well as possible 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.500
 technical and tactical characteristics in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.510
 our deployment 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.479
 we work with the staff to try to 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.050
 improve everyone beyond the jokes 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.000
 individually in tactics 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.850
 individual to insert into a tactic 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.720
 collective game that can give us 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.490
 mentality organization to be effective 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.200
 then to go and make the right games and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.630
 bring home what you need 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.190
 which therefore serves us to value 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.770
 of individuals is always a factor 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.300
 important because raising the value 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.490
 single then also rises 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.649
 automatically the team value from 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.700
 a boy we chose 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.770
 identified because it has 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.780
 first and foremost features left-handed 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.640
 because in our defensive line there 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.250
 one left-footed player was missing 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.660
 left is an explosive so a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.930
 player who can re-enter 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.570
 parameters of characteristics that we 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.489
 we were looking for an explosive head piece 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.780
 in one against one with this 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.150
 characteristic is clear that in the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.670
 defensive mechanisms will have to know 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
 better companions as we want 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.709
 then move once 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
 tactically he will have achieved 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.370
 the organization of the others in the department 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.830
 then he can be said to be a player a 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.259
 all the effects of palermo 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.259
 [Applause]
