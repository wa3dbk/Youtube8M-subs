cares<00:01:32.070> man<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> ak-47<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.900> amazing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
cares man it's the ak-47 it's amazing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
cares man it's the ak-47 it's amazing
now<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> move<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> Wonder

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
now I'm going to move on to the Wonder

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
now I'm going to move on to the Wonder
weapon<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.380> map<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.250> amazing<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
weapon of this map and it's amazing it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670 
weapon of this map and it's amazing it
works<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> few<00:01:39.420> different<00:01:39.570> ways<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:40.200> right

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
works in a few different ways all right

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
works in a few different ways all right
so<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> thing<00:01:41.310> looks<00:01:41.610> similar<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> shotgun

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
so this thing looks similar to a shotgun

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.039 
so this thing looks similar to a shotgun
but<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.710> works<00:01:44.540> amazingly<00:01:45.540> well<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
but it works amazingly well as you can

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
but it works amazingly well as you can
see<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:47.130> two<00:01:47.310> barrels<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:47.820> it's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
see it's got not two barrels but it's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
see it's got not two barrels but it's
got<00:01:48.060> four<00:01:48.329> barrels<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> range<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
got four barrels so the range on this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.560 
got four barrels so the range on this
thing<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> absolutely<00:01:50.909> ridiculous<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
thing is absolutely ridiculous it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
thing is absolutely ridiculous it
reminds<00:01:51.869> me<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> gun<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.130> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
reminds me of a gun that you can get in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
reminds me of a gun that you can get in
Bioshock<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.049> works<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
Bioshock actually but this works as a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100 
Bioshock actually but this works as a
shotgun<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.240> different<00:01:57.930> sort

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
shotgun but it also has a different sort

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
shotgun but it also has a different sort
of<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.829> well<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.189> you'll<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.520> coming

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
of use as well which you'll see coming

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.359 
of use as well which you'll see coming
up<00:02:00.000> shortly<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.869> works<00:02:01.259> not<00:02:01.530> only<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
up shortly it works not only just as a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.940 
up shortly it works not only just as a
shotgun<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:03.090> incredible<00:02:03.750> range<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.740> only

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
shotgun with incredible range the only

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
shotgun with incredible range the only
problem<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> reload<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.390> every

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
problem is you have to reload it every

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.260 
problem is you have to reload it every
show<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.350> also<00:02:07.469> works<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.160> an<00:02:08.459> acid<00:02:08.910> gun<00:02:09.119> as

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
show but it also works as an acid gun as

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.660 
show but it also works as an acid gun as
well<00:02:09.300> where<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.989> shoot<00:02:10.289> acid<00:02:10.500> sticks<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
well where you can shoot acid sticks to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.650 
well where you can shoot acid sticks to
zombies<00:02:12.150> which<00:02:12.390> will

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
zombies which will

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720 
zombies which will
then<00:02:12.780> caused<00:02:13.320> them<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.680> explode<00:02:14.160> causing<00:02:14.460> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
then caused them to explode causing a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.790 
then caused them to explode causing a
mass<00:02:14.970> explosion<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.690> gas<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.500> guess<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
mass explosion of gas so I guess the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.860 
mass explosion of gas so I guess the
slicker<00:02:17.070> fire<00:02:17.340> was<00:02:17.520> sort<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.060> test<00:02:18.480> trial

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
slicker fire was sort of a test trial

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.960 
slicker fire was sort of a test trial
run<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:19.770> actual<00:02:20.130> weapon<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.850> is

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
run of this actual weapon so that is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.910 
run of this actual weapon so that is
pretty<00:02:21.240> cool<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.690> itself<00:02:22.020> now<00:02:22.530> from<00:02:22.740> what<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
pretty cool in itself now from what I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.890 
pretty cool in itself now from what I
believe<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.610> gun<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.090> another<00:02:24.450> buildable

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
believe this gun is another buildable

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750 
believe this gun is another buildable
weapon<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> actual<00:02:26.190> fact<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.610> can

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
weapon but the actual fact that you can

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760 
weapon but the actual fact that you can
put<00:02:26.940> an<00:02:27.060> acid<00:02:27.480> attachment<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:28.110> top<00:02:28.320> makes<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
put an acid attachment on top makes it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.380 
put an acid attachment on top makes it
sort<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> buildable<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.240> can

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
sort of like a buildable but you can

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.270 
sort of like a buildable but you can
also<00:02:30.540> augment<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.040> other

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
also augment it so you can have other

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.060 
also augment it so you can have other
stuff<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:33.000> top<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.750> gun<00:02:34.020> as<00:02:34.230> well<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.890> this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
stuff on top of that gun as well so this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.280 
stuff on top of that gun as well so this
looks<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.640> very<00:02:35.940> fun<00:02:36.360> wonder<00:02:36.810> weapon<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
looks like a very fun wonder weapon and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.410 
looks like a very fun wonder weapon and
I<00:02:37.650> can't<00:02:38.040> wait<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.550> map<00:02:38.790> I'm<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.360> to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I can't wait for this map I'm going to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.730 
I can't wait for this map I'm going to
be<00:02:39.510> releasing<00:02:39.690> loads<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> video<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.590> very

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
be releasing loads of video is very

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.680 
be releasing loads of video is very
similar<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.400> through<00:02:41.640> all<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.270> sorts<00:02:42.600> of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
similar going through all the sorts of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.840 
similar going through all the sorts of
stuff<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.260> map<00:02:43.470> including<00:02:44.160> weapons<00:02:44.370> like

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
stuff on this map including weapons like

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.250 
stuff on this map including weapons like
this<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.240> we've<00:02:45.390> already<00:02:45.540> done<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> weapons

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this so we've already done the weapons

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.960 
this so we've already done the weapons
there's<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.950> video<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> new

perk there's going to be a video on the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.740
