00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.570
 let's cook with our pot 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.710
 programmable model of a tortilla 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.020
 potatoes in the cookbook come several 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.689
 guys but we're going to do 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 our own tortilla without following 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 none of the ones that come in the book 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.619
 for this we have cut the potatoes in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.230
 Juliana 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.619
 let's use olive oil salt and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.619
 eggs 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.780
 in it we lose all the kicks 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.949
 we help ourselves from the utensil that comes is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.350
 very important to use that kind of 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.769
 utensils that do not damage the Teflon of the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.769
 wheel 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.820
 we take the measuring cup 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.180
 and we fill it with olive oil until 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.180
 half 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.899
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.899
 we were united 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.750
 we move a little with the palette that comes 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 and we close our nail 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.040
 At this point we are going to schedule 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.860
 pot 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.430
 in this case for omelette 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.740
 let's select kitchen menus 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.600
 we see but an 8 appears on the screen 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.540
 are the minutes that come 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.790
 predetermined 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.440
 for us in this case it comes to us 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.870
 great so we left it such 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.670
 what but if we needed more or less 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.420
 minutes we can select it in this 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.250
 button here 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.130
 when we see that the hairline of the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.090
 screen start to go up to download is that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.010
 the pot is already cooking with which 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.489
 our person does not have to be 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.489
 sailing 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.459
 a couple of precautions that you have to take 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.409
 with this pot is to take into account that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.330
 when we are going to pour the ingredients 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.370
 inside to make sure we have the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.260
 piggyback accounts do not pour it without the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.140
 because that way it spoils we would do the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.930
 pot and also a precaution to take in 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.780
 account procuring not to put pot 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.790
 in hot glass ceramic because 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.439
 we removed the plastic cover 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.629
 one of the advantages also has 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.740
 our programmable pot is that if in 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.780
 some time of the recipe separate them 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.010
 absolutely nothing happens because 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.080
 when it comes to light again again 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.420
 the recipe is still in the same place 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.420
 to try unplugging the machine worth 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.160
 we plugged in the machine and we see that in 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.400
 the screen is obviously here has been 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 off 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.560
 if we plug it back in 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.260
 follows exactly for the same time 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.900
 our machine whistled and is zero with 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:29.230
 which already finished frying the lids 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.230
 Caution man we throw the grain 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.990
 once it has all the steam out 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.910
 we open the lid we never force them 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.090
 because until there is no pressure 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.610
 inside the pot they will not let us 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.460
 we work in one of the systems 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.520
 security that this pot has 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.520
 Y 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 ah 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.250
 and I'm a guayre that feeds 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.190
 with our ladle 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.190
 we see move 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.530
 my life 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.459
 it smells great 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.840
 and now the next step 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.840
 in adding the eggs 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.690
 we have here prepared 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.510
 we just give him the little finger and 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.780
 we will see it 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.450
 this is a simple potato omelet 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.910
 but we can add any type 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.120
 of chorizo or bacon ingredients that 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.590
 you spare what we want 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.590
 and so for a day 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.420
 do not 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.140
 with this little hammer that pulls you 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.140
 and web 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.560
 We can not see you inside the bucket 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.750
 if you lie 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.750
 and let's move again with listening 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.340
 we see what it looks like we cover 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.949
 new and we program the pot 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.080
 once he has added the egg we go back to 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:36.480
 program use the same program 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.480
 before cooking button 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.240
 cooks and we get the same 8 minutes of 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.760
 before, how do we need it? 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.370
 we give this button 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.849
 they have subtracted minutes from us 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.849
 5 and no longer show which 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:58.550
 we will see the dashes discount the 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.550
 time and the days will end 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.960
 again the programming has finished 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.870
 with which we open the pot 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.110
 two 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.110
 that our breath is already finished 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.310
 is in the part that would be below 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.000
 It was white and on the other hand 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.990
 is pulsed we take out very carefully 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.610
 the bucket always protecting the hands 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.610
 and we put it on a table mat 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:45.040
 and the moment will come back 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.040
 we go with the deadline 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.970
 how do we choose our population 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.970
 and quickly 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.790
 to the potato omelet 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.240
 to eat 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.690
 and remember that we have only taken 13 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.690
 minutes
