George<00:04:27.630> Foreman<00:04:28.020> grill<00:04:28.050> if<00:04:28.740> I'm<00:04:28.980> lazy<00:04:29.280> then

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
George Foreman grill if I'm lazy then

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.810 
George Foreman grill if I'm lazy then
I'll<00:04:30.120> go<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:31.080> deli<00:04:31.290> I'll<00:04:31.590> get<00:04:32.160> some<00:04:32.430> shaved

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
I'll go to the deli I'll get some shaved

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.860 
I'll go to the deli I'll get some shaved
turkey<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:34.280> use<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.520> instead<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.330> lot

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
turkey and use that instead so lot

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.750 
turkey and use that instead so lot
faster<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.470> way<00:04:37.580> also<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.600> add<00:04:39.840> pasta

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
faster that way also I like to add pasta

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.420 
faster that way also I like to add pasta
so<00:04:41.760> I'm<00:04:42.630> going<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.960> throw<00:04:43.169> some<00:04:43.410> pasta<00:04:43.830> onto<00:04:44.250> my

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
so I'm going to throw some pasta onto my

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.620 
so I'm going to throw some pasta onto my
salad<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.410> usually<00:04:46.410> use<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> whole<00:04:47.490> wheat<00:04:47.820> pasta

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.390 

so<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.990> gives<00:04:52.140> me<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.380> good<00:04:52.560> carbohydrate

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
so it gives me a good carbohydrate

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.050 
so it gives me a good carbohydrate
source<00:04:55.400> added<00:04:56.400> fiber<00:04:56.900> I'm<00:04:57.900> going<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.010> salt<00:04:59.669> I

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
source added fiber I'm going to salt I

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.240 
source added fiber I'm going to salt I
know<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:01.260> there's<00:05:01.440> most<00:05:01.680> likely<00:05:01.770> some

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
know that there's most likely some

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.700 
know that there's most likely some
dietitians<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:03.060> doctors<00:05:03.570> right<00:05:03.810> now<00:05:03.840> are

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
dietitians and doctors right now are

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.890 
dietitians and doctors right now are
most<00:05:04.770> likely<00:05:05.160> throwing<00:05:05.790> their<00:05:05.940> empty<00:05:06.390> salt

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
most likely throwing their empty salt

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.230 
most likely throwing their empty salt
shakers<00:05:07.350> at<00:05:07.620> me<00:05:07.980> but<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:08.790> want<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.150> to

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
shakers at me but I want you to

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.640 
shakers at me but I want you to
understand<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.810> there<00:05:10.050> is<00:05:10.230> a<00:05:10.260> salt

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
understand that there is a salt

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.130 
understand that there is a salt
controversy<00:05:11.490> but<00:05:12.180> I'm<00:05:12.360> going<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.630> actually<00:05:12.780> do

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
controversy but I'm going to actually do

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.440 
controversy but I'm going to actually do
a<00:05:13.169> video<00:05:13.500> about<00:05:13.650> this<00:05:14.130> whole<00:05:14.340> process<00:05:14.640> and<00:05:15.240> you

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
a video about this whole process and you

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.030 
a video about this whole process and you
need<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.780> understand<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.470> from<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.830> heart

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
need to understand that from a heart

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.909 
need to understand that from a heart
health<00:05:17.250> standpoint<00:05:17.700> it's<00:05:18.120> not<00:05:18.750> just<00:05:19.169> salt<00:05:19.530> but

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
health standpoint it's not just salt but

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.760 
health standpoint it's not just salt but
it's<00:05:20.070> your<00:05:20.280> mineral<00:05:20.790> composition<00:05:21.750> it's<00:05:22.320> salt

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
it's your mineral composition it's salt

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.409 
it's your mineral composition it's salt
and<00:05:23.070> potassium<00:05:24.050> it's<00:05:25.050> magnesium<00:05:25.980> and<00:05:26.160> calcium

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
and potassium it's magnesium and calcium

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.600 
and potassium it's magnesium and calcium
and<00:05:27.419> so<00:05:28.080> when<00:05:28.470> you're<00:05:28.590> looking<00:05:28.620> at<00:05:29.070> fruits<00:05:29.430> and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
and so when you're looking at fruits and

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.270 
and so when you're looking at fruits and
vegetables<00:05:30.090> they<00:05:30.690> are<00:05:30.900> low<00:05:31.260> in<00:05:31.530> sodium<00:05:31.830> and

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
vegetables they are low in sodium and

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.370 
vegetables they are low in sodium and
high<00:05:32.900> in<00:05:33.900> potassium<00:05:34.730> so<00:05:35.730> by<00:05:36.390> doing<00:05:36.450> this<00:05:36.960> I<00:05:37.169> can

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
high in potassium so by doing this I can

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.950 
high in potassium so by doing this I can
add<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.860> little<00:05:38.130> salt<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.910> this<00:05:39.060> process<00:05:39.360> and

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
add a little salt to this process and

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.980 
add a little salt to this process and
brings<00:05:40.590> out<00:05:40.800> some<00:05:41.130> flavor<00:05:41.400> for<00:05:41.730> me<00:05:41.880> now<00:05:42.690> i'm

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
brings out some flavor for me now i'm

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.810 
brings out some flavor for me now i'm
going<00:05:43.140> to<00:05:43.230> throw<00:05:43.290> some<00:05:43.710> walnuts<00:05:44.130> on<00:05:44.280> top<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.700> it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
going to throw some walnuts on top of it

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.320 
going to throw some walnuts on top of it
so<00:05:44.850> i'm<00:05:45.120> going

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
so i'm going

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:53.059 
so i'm going
get<00:05:45.479> some<00:05:45.659> omega-3s<00:05:46.319> and<00:05:51.439> I'm<00:05:52.439> going<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:52.830> top

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
get some omega-3s and I'm going to top

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.820 
get some omega-3s and I'm going to top
it<00:05:53.280> all<00:05:53.460> off<00:05:53.490> with<00:05:54.449> a<00:05:54.479> creamy<00:05:54.870> poppy<00:05:55.409> seed

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.830 
it all off with a creamy poppy seed
dressing<00:05:56.240> you<00:05:57.240> can<00:05:57.419> choose<00:05:57.659> your<00:05:57.780> own

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
dressing you can choose your own

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.749 
dressing you can choose your own
dressing<00:05:58.409> I<00:05:58.530> like<00:05:58.919> this<00:05:59.189> because<00:05:59.430> the

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
dressing I like this because the

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:05.469
