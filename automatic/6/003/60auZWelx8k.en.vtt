UK<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.110> that's<00:03:10.739> actually<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.069> feature<00:03:11.280> only

which<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> bit<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> shame<00:03:15.200> another<00:03:16.200> thing

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
which is a bit of a shame another thing

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.319 
which is a bit of a shame another thing
that<00:03:16.590> i<00:03:16.650> really<00:03:16.680> do<00:03:17.010> like<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.970> clock<00:03:18.209> on

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
that i really do like is the clock on

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.360 
that i really do like is the clock on
here<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.139> mean<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.620> into<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.010> clock<00:03:20.250> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
here so I mean going into the clock you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.849 
here so I mean going into the clock you
can<00:03:20.549> see<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.410> different<00:03:22.709> layout

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
can see have a bit of a different layout

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.620 
can see have a bit of a different layout
here<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.400> looks<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:24.120> really

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
here and it just looks really really

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.420 
here and it just looks really really
nice<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.049> think<00:03:25.109> it's<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> really<00:03:26.220> well

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
nice I think it's just a really well

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.180 
nice I think it's just a really well
polished<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.150> overall<00:03:27.720> UI<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.440> that's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
polished and overall UI and that's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.069 
polished and overall UI and that's
something<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.880> come<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.239> expect<00:03:30.540> from<00:03:30.630> Apple

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
something you come to expect from Apple

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.930 
something you come to expect from Apple
but<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.769> say<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.010> didn't<00:03:32.370> want<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.549> get<00:03:32.700> too

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
but like I say I didn't want to get too

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.000 
but like I say I didn't want to get too
much<00:03:32.970> into<00:03:33.180> sort<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.019> demonstrating<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:34.859> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
much into sort of demonstrating what the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
much into sort of demonstrating what the
applications<00:03:35.970> actually<00:03:36.120> look<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.750> just

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
applications actually look like I just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.930 
applications actually look like I just
wanted<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.109> talk<00:03:37.290> about<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.709> UI<00:03:37.859> overall<00:03:38.489> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
wanted to talk about the UI overall and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.759 
wanted to talk about the UI overall and
I<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.109> it<00:03:40.260> comes<00:03:40.410> with

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
I think you know it comes with

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.349 
I think you know it comes with
expectation<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.880> there's<00:03:42.060> going<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.239> be<00:03:42.299> a

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
expectation that there's going to be a

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.300 
expectation that there's going to be a
lot<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.569> bugs<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.019> I've<00:03:43.829> noticed<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> few

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
lot of bugs and I've noticed a few

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.979 
lot of bugs and I've noticed a few
obviously<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.209> just<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.480> developer

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
obviously this is just a developer

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.199 
obviously this is just a developer
bookbuild<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> beta<00:03:47.310> 1<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:48.120> it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
bookbuild and this is the beta 1 so it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.520 
bookbuild and this is the beta 1 so it
will<00:03:48.359> be<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.540> little<00:03:48.810> bit<00:03:48.959> bugging<00:03:49.319> I've

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
will be a little bit bugging I've

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.590 
will be a little bit bugging I've
noticed<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.100> lot<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.280> app<00:03:50.489> crashes<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.329> other

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
noticed a lot of app crashes and other

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.080 
noticed a lot of app crashes and other
things<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.530> again<00:03:53.250> better<00:03:53.489> in<00:03:53.670> mind<00:03:53.850> if<00:03:54.000> you're

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
things so again better in mind if you're

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.490 
things so again better in mind if you're
going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.299> be<00:03:54.359> looking<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.720> download<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
going to be looking to download this I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.589 
going to be looking to download this I
think<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.160> stable<00:03:56.489> enough<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.910> use<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.420> as

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
think it is stable enough to use it as

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.229 
think it is stable enough to use it as
you<00:03:57.780> know<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> primary<00:03:58.620> kind<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.430> software<00:04:00.030> if

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
you know a primary kind of software if

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.640 
you know a primary kind of software if
you<00:04:00.329> put<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.599> on<00:04:00.780> your<00:04:00.870> device<00:04:01.139> and<00:04:01.170> used<00:04:01.530> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
you put this on your device and used it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.140 
you put this on your device and used it
every<00:04:01.739> day<00:04:01.889> it's<00:04:02.220> definitely<00:04:02.579> stable<00:04:02.970> enough

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
every day it's definitely stable enough

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.210 
every day it's definitely stable enough
to<00:04:03.209> do<00:04:03.389> that<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.709> sort<00:04:04.889> of<00:04:04.920> bear<00:04:05.130> in

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
to do that and but just sort of bear in

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.289 
to do that and but just sort of bear in
mind<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.609> might<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.030> little<00:04:06.150> bit

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
mind you might get a little bit

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.030 
mind you might get a little bit
frustrated<00:04:06.900> by<00:04:07.109> certain<00:04:07.560> things<00:04:07.799> and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
frustrated by certain things and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.220 
frustrated by certain things and
crashing<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.000> not<00:04:09.180> working<00:04:09.329> as<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.810> as<00:04:10.079> they

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
crashing and not working as a as they

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.830 
crashing and not working as a as they
should<00:04:10.440> do<00:04:10.590> really<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.099> so<00:04:11.849> something<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.720> I

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
should do really and so something that I

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.930 
should do really and so something that I
must<00:04:13.500> admit<00:04:13.590> I'm<00:04:13.799> not<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> massive<00:04:14.400> fan<00:04:14.579> of<00:04:14.609> is

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
must admit I'm not a massive fan of is

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.240 
must admit I'm not a massive fan of is
this<00:04:15.150> kind<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.599> grey<00:04:16.139> bar<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.829> bottom<00:04:16.979> here

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
this kind of grey bar on the bottom here

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.830 
this kind of grey bar on the bottom here
which<00:04:17.459> kind<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.789> highlights<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.359> dock<00:04:18.599> I

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
which kind of highlights the dock I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.750 
which kind of highlights the dock I
really<00:04:19.530> don't<00:04:19.950> like<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.519> I'm<00:04:20.639> being

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
really don't like that if I'm being

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.130 
really don't like that if I'm being
honest<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.299> think<00:04:21.690> there<00:04:21.810> should<00:04:21.959> be<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.079> way

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
honest and I think there should be a way

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.140 
honest and I think there should be a way
of<00:04:22.289> turning<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.740> off<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.580> there<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.880> let<00:04:24.060> me

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
of turning it off and if there is let me

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.880 
of turning it off and if there is let me
know<00:04:24.300> because<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.690> haven't<00:04:24.870> found<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.260> yet<00:04:25.320> it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
know because I haven't found it yet it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.430 
know because I haven't found it yet it
just<00:04:26.070> reminds<00:04:26.460> me<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.909> really

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
just reminds me of the really

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.340 
just reminds me of the really
iOS<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.430> think<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.030> was<00:04:29.180> three<00:04:29.480> that<00:04:29.720> had<00:04:29.870> that

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
iOS I think I was three that had that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.560 
iOS I think I was three that had that
kind<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.650> design<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.760> was<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.150> even<00:04:32.330> wear

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
kind of design and I was to even wear

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.120 
kind of design and I was to even wear
before<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.110> could<00:04:33.290> have<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.560> wallpapers<00:04:34.010> on

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
before you could have the wallpapers on

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.890 
before you could have the wallpapers on
there<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:34.460> just<00:04:35.150> looks<00:04:35.330> very<00:04:35.540> similar<00:04:35.720> to

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
there just just looks very similar to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.420 
there just just looks very similar to
that<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.530> guess<00:04:36.740> that's<00:04:36.950> what<00:04:37.130> they<00:04:37.160> kind

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
that and I guess that's what they kind

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.800 
that and I guess that's what they kind
of<00:04:37.490> trying<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.910> do<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.300> just<00:04:38.540> don't<00:04:38.690> really

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
of trying to do but I just don't really

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.620 
of trying to do but I just don't really
like<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.140> look<00:04:39.260> at<00:04:39.410> that<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:40.160> overall<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:40.940> think

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
like to look at that and overall I think

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.200 
like to look at that and overall I think
it's<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.020> really<00:04:42.050> nice<00:04:42.470> em<00:04:42.860> little<00:04:43.210> software

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
it's a really nice em little software

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.750 
it's a really nice em little software
