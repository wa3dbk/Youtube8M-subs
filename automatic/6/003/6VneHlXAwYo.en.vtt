but<00:00:58.739> initially<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.190> thought<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> might<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
but initially I thought that might be a

looks so depressed and you look down in
here<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.810> right<00:01:24.590> here<00:01:24.619> near<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.159> eve<00:01:25.340> where<00:01:25.760> a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
here and right here near the eve where a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.340 
here and right here near the eve where a
lot<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.210> water<00:01:26.390> must<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.780> rolled<00:01:27.110> down

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
lot of the water must have rolled down

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.530

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
just started rolling down you know some

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.670 
just started rolling down you know some
of<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> looks<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.630> can<00:01:41.780> see<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.229> see<00:01:42.500> where
