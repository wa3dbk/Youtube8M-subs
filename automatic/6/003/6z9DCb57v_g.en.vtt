00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
but I don't think extinction is a big

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.999 
but I don't think extinction is a big
seller<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:37.060> DLC<00:01:37.810> just<00:01:38.170> like<00:01:38.289> zombies<00:01:38.740> is

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
seller of DLC just like zombies is

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.620 
seller of DLC just like zombies is
extinction<00:01:39.850> doesn't<00:01:40.240> really<00:01:40.390> have<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
extinction doesn't really have that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.359 
extinction doesn't really have that

kind<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.060> like<00:01:43.210> zombies<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.960> feel<00:01:44.439> that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
kind of like zombies so I feel that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.800 
kind of like zombies so I feel that
sledgehammer<00:01:44.890> kind<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.850> took<00:01:46.000> notice<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.539> what

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
sledgehammer kind of took notice of what

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.090 
sledgehammer kind of took notice of what

happened we call duty ghosts they

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.130 
happened we call duty ghosts they
probably<00:01:48.310> saw<00:01:48.579> that<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:49.149> wasn't<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.539> successful

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
probably saw that it wasn't a successful

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.719 
probably saw that it wasn't a successful
extinction<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.859> successful<00:01:51.369> but<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.609> not

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
quite on the level of what zombies can

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.469 
quite on the level of what zombies can
do<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.280> they<00:01:54.430> already<00:01:54.549> have<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> blueprint

successful in that zombies now this

00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.730 
successful in that zombies now this
doesn't<00:01:58.930> mean<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.200> they're<00:01:59.380> going<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.560> have

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
doesn't mean that they're going to have

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.870 
doesn't mean that they're going to have
zombies<00:02:00.100> on<00:02:00.219> their<00:02:00.310> own<00:02:00.430> game<00:02:00.640> that's

zombies on their own game that's

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.609 
zombies on their own game that's
something<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.180> comes<00:02:01.420> unique<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.049> our<00:02:02.289> games

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619

something that comes unique to our games
now<00:02:03.100> big<00:02:03.609> opportunity<00:02:04.210> for<00:02:04.390> them<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.539> kind<00:02:04.869> of

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
now big opportunity for them to kind of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.630 
now big opportunity for them to kind of
branch<00:02:05.380> out<00:02:05.679> through<00:02:05.890> their<00:02:06.009> own<00:02:06.130> thing<00:02:06.399> it's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
branch out through their own thing it's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.450 
branch out through their own thing it's
set<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.000> futuristic<00:02:07.149> time<00:02:07.810> 2050<00:02:08.619> for<00:02:08.860> this

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
set in a futuristic time 2050 for this

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.680 
set in a futuristic time 2050 for this
means<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.789> they<00:02:10.000> could<00:02:10.149> do<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.450> many<00:02:10.570> things

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
means that they could do so many things

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.210 
means that they could do so many things
there<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.380> future<00:02:11.710> we<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:11.980> know<00:02:12.070> what's

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
there in the future we don't know what's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.770 
there in the future we don't know what's
going<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.370> happen<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> future<00:02:13.030> they<00:02:13.630> got

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
going to happen in the future they got

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.390 
going to happen in the future they got
these<00:02:13.900> mech<00:02:14.200> suits<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.560> they<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:14.800> put<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.190> or

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
these mech suits that they can put on or

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.310 
these mech suits that they can put on or
they<00:02:15.490> got<00:02:15.610> these<00:02:16.110> exoskeletons<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.230> they

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
they got these exoskeletons that they

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.810 
they got these exoskeletons that they
can<00:02:17.440> put<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.430> could<00:02:18.580> lead<00:02:18.760> to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
can put on so this could lead to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.910 
can put on so this could lead to
something<00:02:19.210> really<00:02:19.570> cool<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.960> cyborgs<00:02:20.620> being

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
something really cool like cyborgs being

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.600 
something really cool like cyborgs being
in<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> future

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
in the future

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.950 
in the future
got<00:02:21.730> these<00:02:21.880> hovercrafts<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.780> so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
got these hovercrafts and so so

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.870 
got these hovercrafts and so so
obviously<00:02:23.350> there's<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.980> big<00:02:24.220> advancement<00:02:24.700> in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
obviously there's a big advancement in

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.330 
obviously there's a big advancement in
technology<00:02:25.020> who<00:02:26.020> knows<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.500> saw<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.830> cyborg

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
technology who knows we saw that cyborg

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.890 
technology who knows we saw that cyborg
zombies<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.030> saw<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> while<00:02:28.420> ago<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.660> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
zombies that we saw a while ago that is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.690 
zombies that we saw a while ago that is
in<00:02:29.020> call<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.230> duty<00:02:29.320> online<00:02:29.620> maybe<00:02:30.430> that's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
in call of duty online maybe that's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.250 
in call of duty online maybe that's
something<00:02:30.910> similar<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.390> what<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:32.080> in
