00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.619
 we jumped and offered a minivan 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.539
 new generation that marks 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.019
 really a break with the generation 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.730
 before 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.529
 motivation makes stylists when 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 we started the project was everything 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.130
 simply to renew the genre and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.259
 serves as well as who sign up 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.890
 in the new line of products 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.449
 citroÃ«n 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.559
 We have worked with 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.380
 engineers who develops the new 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.420
 the famous platform of mp2 which has us 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 allowed in fact to position the wheels 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 exactly where we wanted it 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.600
 and we do not have the impression when we 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
 sees the vehicle in the street that he is 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.420
 like the original sketch it serves or 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.310
 four points the very cantilever 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 reduced and very dense car very 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.390
 very muscular very very strong years ago he 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.100
 front of new c4 picasso 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 truly genuinely technology 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.210
 with its very healthy brl that gives a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 signature and wide to slender 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.380
 vehicles with finesse one associates 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.910
 often the technology it comes out 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.129
 directly concepts because we have 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.200
 could present in recent years where he 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.939
 is still a game with the drl and with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.530
 the optics dialogue with each other without 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.659
 necessarily be attached to each other 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.830
 which is also new in 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.770
 outside style on this car 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.360
 it's the care we've taken to have a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.400
 growing strand that incorporates fires 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.049
 back on the shutter what we are told 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 all the cutting lines in particular 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.650
 the lines that share this and that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.800
 it's important in terms of quality 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.420
 perceived of robustness excess of simplicity 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.250
 shapes the philosophy of design 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.229
 inside it's both the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
 valorization of the driver and each 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.159
 passengers we want in a minivan 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.880
 to several inside and then it's 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.320
 also ease of use 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.500
 ease of driving ease of access to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.500
 edge 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.930
 from the very beginning of the project, in reality 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.939
 stylists wanted through the drawing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the dashboard expressed a spirit 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.860
 loft in the interior give a maximum 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.049
 of space to the occupants of the well-being the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 brightness the brightness we feel at 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.160
 the interior of this car participates 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.270
 greatly to the well-being of 5 meters 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.330
 squares of glazing aboard this 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.459
 car windshield panoramic you cielo 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.110
 large dimensions and create 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.750
 glazing all around the car that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.760
 are also very generous and well-being 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.050
 on board also passes by the comfort the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.930
 comfortable seating especially 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.709
 and then with an exclusivity in this 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.260
 segment 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.930
 these language impacts this language pack it's 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.580
 a little business class seat that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.470
 integrates a rest function with 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.390
 motorized calves the chair is 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.220
 also equipped with a support head relaxes 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.350
 and even an anti- massage function 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.180
 not activated on his record for me this 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.790
 new c4 picasso it's it's 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.390
 energy is density is 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.880
 agility and it's well-being the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.920
 ease of use 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.239
 there is in this new c4 picasso a 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.650
 beginning of the new story that 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.870
 are currently writing by 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.250
 model them this simplicity this purity 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.959
 that we are looking for in the masses 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.430
 also the relevant spirit of the masses who 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.260
 have to characterize a citroen 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.549
 certainly a lot of things that we 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.170
 let's present today through these 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.170
 vehicles would end up gamaty
