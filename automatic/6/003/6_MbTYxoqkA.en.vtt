00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
downside I found with it was this little

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.740 
downside I found with it was this little
clip<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
clip here as you can kind of see here it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
clip here as you can kind of see here it
if<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> gets<00:01:07.560> caught<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.979> anything<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
if it gets caught on anything that I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
if it gets caught on anything that I
found<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> bends<00:01:09.479> fairly<00:01:09.840> easy<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.549> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
found it bends fairly easy but it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
found it bends fairly easy but it's
fairly<00:01:11.790> easy<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.119> bend<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.260> take<00:01:13.950> out
