00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.349
 how to imagine then the effect that an asteroid of 500 could have 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.349
 kilometers in diameter colliding with the earth 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.810
 This reconstruction has been carried out under the control of experts in 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.809
 geophysics 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.999
 to facilitate the understanding of the proportions the land has been 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:37.999
 represented as we know it today 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.060
 an asteroid 500 kilometers in diameter is for example larger than 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.060
 any of the islands that make up Japan 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.650
 the point of impact was located in the Pacific Ocean between Japan and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 Australia 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.260
 the speed of the asteroid is 72 thousand kilometers per hour but as it is huge 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 everything seems to develop in slow motion 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.980
 by the effect of the impact the earth's crust of a ten kilometers 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.170
 of thickness 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420
 it takes off from the mantle 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 producing what is known as a sunat basket a tsunami of the court 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.700
 the thin white film 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 they are the four thousand meters of depth of the ocean 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 the archipelago of japan is automatically pulverized 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.309
 gigantic pieces are projected beyond the atmosphere to several thousand 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.219
 kilometers of the surface before falling back to earth 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.219
 producing the effect of bombs from a trap 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.369
 the lips of the crater form an immense chain of mountains of seven thousand 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.369
 meters high 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.629
 the crater itself is a gulf four thousand kilometers in diameter 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.010
 and this is only the first instants of the catastrophe 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.949
 my life 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:02.009
 this immense incandescent dome that remains over the crater for about 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.590
 moments after the impact 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.590
 and whistle to overthrow 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.439
 one hundred billion megatone is rock instantly transformed into steam 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.439
 by the extreme heat generated by the collision 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.709
 after inflating forming a dome we are to steam rock and support and 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.709
 it expands at great speed in all directions 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.159
 just three hours after the impact on the ocean an extraordinary burst 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.669
 of rock vapor with four thousand degrees centigrade temperature and 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.959
 moving at a speed of 300 meters per second 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.959
 reaches the himalayas 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.550
 the rock vapor now reaches the Amazon at the antipodes of the place 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.550
 where the impact occurred 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.000
 the intensity of the heat produces a phenomenon of spontaneous combustion 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.770
 in the blink of an eye the board becomes an Indian ocean 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.060
 twenty-four hours after the impact the entire planet is covered in a 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.060
 high rock steam cloud 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.179
 this cloud will cover the globe for about a year 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.180
 the ocean 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.509
 origin of life 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.529
 it does not escape catastrophe 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.559
 while the rock vapor ends up wrapping the earth 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.559
 the marine surface gurgles everywhere 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.740
 comes to a boil 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.350
 the violence of evaporation lowers the water level a rhythm 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.349
 unimaginable five centimeters per minute 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.499
 the water of the sea disappears completely 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:03.909
 only the salt remains 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.909
 but it also evaporates quickly 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.360
 the ocean floor is now bare and continues to be subjected to that 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.270
 extreme temperature 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.270
 very quickly begins to put 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:27.930
 just one month after the 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.150
 pto this is the aspect that would show the earth under its rock vapor shroud 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.029
 a single collision with an asteroid 500 kilometers in diameter and there is no 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.029
 a single drop of water on the entire planet 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:05.469
 when it happened that the event must have been rooted in all forms of life 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:07.069
 of the surface of the globe 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:08.279
 and yet 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.279
 We are here 

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:23.929
 but after a year the rock vapor dissipated 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.430
 and the temperature began to decrease progressively 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.780
 two thousand years later the water evaporated from the oceans finally returned to 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.060
 condense in the form of rains and fell on the leg at a rate of 3 thousand 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.060
 millimeters per year 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:52.619
 These precipitations are as torrential as those of our zones 

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:53.580
 tropical 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.580
 they were the food of the oceanic vessels 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.270
 in that precise moment 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.720
 under the ocean floor numerous microorganisms were still surviving and 

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.590
 among them our first ancestors
