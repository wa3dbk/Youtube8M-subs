00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi, I 'm Rodrigo, this is another video. 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.210
 the class draw 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.030
 Today I'll show you the difference. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.030
 of xenon and bi xenon comes with us 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.779
 for you to understand a little better 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.640
 see this video here from the side that there I 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 I explain to you about the models of 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.430
 fitting of the lamps used in the headlights 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 of cars 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 now I'll show you the h4 models 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.059
 xenon 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 here I have a model lamp h 42 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.190
 this model has two fillets of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 lamp in single socket a lamp 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.620
 xenon and the other logic is when 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 you light low light ascended this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.570
 lamp the xenon lamp 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 when you turn on the high light xenon 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 erases and here comes the halogen lamp 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.699
 that it is yellowed just like cars that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.430
 come from factory also has the model h 43 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.039
 and with the single fillet and cover 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.619
 metal make the light low and the light high as 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.510
 that happens it would be the low beam and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.610
 He already called arrived normal. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 when triggering high light bulbs and mexico 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.210
 making it released more light to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.670
 front of the lighthouse 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.479
 this way you have light come on high 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.479
 and the bar 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.340
 so summarizing our video of 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.770
 today me xenon is not a lamp anymore 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.680
 strong or more powerful is just the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.740
 given by the expression 43 h light having 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.340
 the function of arrived in high light and light 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.790
 low 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 different from the lamp 42 which has the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.680
 xenon function in low light and high 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.870
 She is the shop in the yellow like us 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.070
 cars coming crash thank you very much for 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.900
