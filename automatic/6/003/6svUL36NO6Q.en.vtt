then the rest of the world would would

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.500 
then the rest of the world would would
take<00:04:22.320> them<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:23.340> for<00:04:23.699> example<00:04:23.760> America

we're<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.200> first<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.560> cast<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.070> shows<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.660> we

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
we're the first to cast the shows and we

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.210 
we're the first to cast the shows and we
so<00:04:27.990> we<00:04:28.110> learned<00:04:28.380> from<00:04:28.590> them<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.100> is

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
so we learned from them that it is

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.379 
so we learned from them that it is
possible<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.669> cast<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> show<00:04:30.150> because<00:04:30.270> we

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
possible to cast the show because we

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.879 
possible to cast the show because we
were<00:04:30.479> worried<00:04:30.750> about<00:04:30.810> our<00:04:30.960> thinking<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.830> know

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
were worried about our thinking you know

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.140 
were worried about our thinking you know
this<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.190> supposed<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.030> always

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
this is supposed to be but we always

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.670 
this is supposed to be but we always
said<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.419> people's<00:04:33.780> quiz<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.320> anybody<00:04:34.470> can

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
said the people's quiz and anybody can

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.080 
said the people's quiz and anybody can
be<00:04:34.770> involved<00:04:35.010> but<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.610> think<00:04:35.760> what<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.940> phone

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
be involved but I think what the phone

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.670 
be involved but I think what the phone
lines<00:04:36.300> are<00:04:36.450> doing<00:04:36.660> by<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:37.110> having<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.500> phone

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
lines are doing by just having the phone

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.200 
lines are doing by just having the phone
