00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.580
 the secret of an object considered the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.950
 computers in the world were 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 revealed with the use of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.950
 X-ray 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.740
 the anti mechanism that will have as it is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.590
 known in about two thousand years and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.869
 was found in 1901 when a group 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.510
 of divers came to an ancient 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.730
 Roman ship wrecked on the coast of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.000
 Greece the object is approximate size 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.520
 of a modern laptop and inside it are 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.410
 several transmission wheels it would have 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 been used to predict solar eclipses 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.020
 and according to recent discoveries the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 mechanism was also used to calculate 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 dates of olympics in ancient greece 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.460
 now an international team of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 scientists are in Athens with the powerful 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.870
 x - ray equipment to uncover the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.300
 mechanism secrets 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.059
 the artifact was placed on a table and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.449
 about 3,000 projections of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.339
 x-ray a computer next to the images 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:08.760
 turning everything into an x- ray in 3d 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 there was fearing freeman and so the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 scientists say that when they saw 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.970
 first formed image were 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.570
 surprised as if it were the discovery of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.000
 an unknown new world for the first time 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.680
 time the team has the data to uncover 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.170
 the operation of Anti which reigns 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 hate just this morning am a flower one 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
 of mathematical project scientists 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 Tony was saying that he decided to make a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.079
 digital model of the mechanism for 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.020
 better understand its operation where 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.240
 says that the amount of parts is incredible 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 placed in a small space 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.399
 the gears were placed in 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.310
 layers almost touching each other 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.590
 the scientists found 27 gears 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.649
 which calculate that in the complete mechanism 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.299
 there were between 50 and 60 wide gears 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.180
 savall environment greenpeace 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.890
 according to Freire, the mechanism changes all 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.110
 ideas we had about what the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.129
 Greeks of ancient times were able to 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 do write technology history 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.010
 shows that things happened in the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.420
 2 before crisis 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.420
 I'm nobody knew
