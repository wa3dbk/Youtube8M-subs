00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
cost about as much to make the movement

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.870 
cost about as much to make the movement
cost<00:01:10.550> about<00:01:10.820> as<00:01:11.000> much<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.360> make<00:01:11.570> as<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:12.880> 31:33

what<00:02:32.239> they're<00:02:32.569> called<00:02:32.840> when<00:02:33.079> they're<00:02:33.230> built

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
what they're called when they're built

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.679 
what they're called when they're built
like<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.579> about<00:02:34.790> 16<00:02:35.239> millimeters

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
like that it is about 16 millimeters

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.899 
like that it is about 16 millimeters
thick<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.439> is<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> thick<00:02:37.069> watch<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.639> even

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
thick so this is a thick watch so even

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.220 
thick so this is a thick watch so even
though<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.689> big<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.019> case

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
though it's not that big in case

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.530 
though it's not that big in case
diameter<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.859> does<00:02:40.099> wear<00:02:40.609> a<00:02:40.939> little<00:02:41.389> bit

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
diameter it does wear a little bit

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.300 
diameter it does wear a little bit
bigger<00:02:41.750> than<00:02:41.959> most<00:02:42.200> dress<00:02:42.469> watches<00:02:42.709> because

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
bigger than most dress watches because

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.750 
bigger than most dress watches because
of<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.579> thickness<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.299> thicknesses<00:02:44.780> is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
of the thickness and that thicknesses is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.979 
of the thickness and that thicknesses is
attributable<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.819> how<00:02:47.209> they<00:02:47.480> have<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:47.840> build

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
attributable to how they have to build

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.259
