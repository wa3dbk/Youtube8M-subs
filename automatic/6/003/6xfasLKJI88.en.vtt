00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.630 
it in there so we can try it out and
we're<00:03:03.510> connected<00:03:04.020> let's<00:03:04.770> go<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> plug<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
we're connected let's go to plug in the

we're connected let's go to plug in the
battery<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.180> try<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.450> out<00:03:09.170> walk<00:03:10.170> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
battery and just try it out walk it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
battery and just try it out walk it
around<00:03:11.030> just<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:13.250> next<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:18.420> let's<00:03:18.630> see

but<00:04:04.400> let's<00:04:04.670> hit<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.270> sensor<00:04:05.540> just<00:04:05.870> test<00:04:06.110> out

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
but let's hit the sensor just test out

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.480 
but let's hit the sensor just test out
when<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.740> close<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.100> door<00:04:07.780> turns<00:04:08.780> off<00:04:09.490> but

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.350 

alright<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.009> there's<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.490> notch<00:04:28.669> right<00:04:28.699> here<00:04:29.210> I

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
alright so there's a notch right here I

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.170 
alright so there's a notch right here I
want<00:04:29.599> to<00:04:29.660> measure<00:04:29.750> I'm<00:04:30.020> up<00:04:30.789> say<00:04:31.789> two<00:04:31.819> and<00:04:32.090> a

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
want to measure I'm up say two and a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.920 
want to measure I'm up say two and a
half<00:04:32.330> inches<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.460> everything<00:04:34.460> both<00:04:34.759> sides<00:04:35.090> are

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
half inches so everything both sides are

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.159 
half inches so everything both sides are
pretty<00:04:36.409> much<00:04:36.639> even<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:38.000> parallel<00:04:38.449> there<00:04:38.930> we<00:04:38.990> go

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
pretty much even in parallel there we go

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.450 
pretty much even in parallel there we go
done<00:04:39.590> with<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.979> passenger<00:04:40.610> side<00:04:42.430> put<00:04:43.430> the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
done with the passenger side put the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.420 
done with the passenger side put the
pressure<00:04:43.789> on<00:04:45.940> body<00:04:46.940> weight<00:04:51.159> let's<00:04:52.159> call<00:04:52.370> this

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
pressure on body weight let's call this

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.100 
pressure on body weight let's call this
door<00:04:52.610> check<00:04:52.789> it<00:04:52.879> out<00:04:57.159> perfect

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
door check it out perfect

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.210 
door check it out perfect
I'm<00:05:00.110> gonna<00:05:00.229> do<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.500> other<00:05:00.590> side<00:05:00.830> right<00:05:00.979> now<00:05:01.159> -

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
cake plate get the ripples - there's

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.520 
cake plate get the ripples - there's
stamp<00:05:30.349> there's<00:05:30.969> right<00:05:31.969> and<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.569> got<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.960> same

uneven<00:05:37.449> leveled<00:05:38.949> foam<00:05:39.949> strips<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.669> got

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
uneven leveled foam strips and you got

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.209 
uneven leveled foam strips and you got
the<00:05:40.909> sod<00:05:41.120> block<00:05:41.449> and<00:05:42.009> reason<00:05:43.009> why<00:05:43.099> they're

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
the sod block and reason why they're

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.379 
the sod block and reason why they're
label<00:05:43.490> because<00:05:43.669> there's<00:05:43.849> a<00:05:43.940> curve<00:05:46.389> which

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
label because there's a curve which

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.649 
label because there's a curve which
points<00:05:47.779> out<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.580> alright<00:05:50.000> prepped<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.539> I'm
