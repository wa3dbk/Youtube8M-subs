relevant to the type of standard is like
I<00:01:38.549> invented<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.119> Stan<00:01:39.329> called<00:01:39.570> ashes<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> ashes

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
I invented a Stan called ashes to ashes

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.170 
I invented a Stan called ashes to ashes
which<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:41.070> particle<00:01:41.490> disintegration

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
which like was particle disintegration

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
which like was particle disintegration
when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.810> punt<00:01:43.020> mill<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> stand<00:01:43.860> punch

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
when you punt mill in the stand punch

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.120 
when you punt mill in the stand punch
something<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> fixed<00:01:45.780> region

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
disable the strong nuclear force and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.730 
disable the strong nuclear force and
cause<00:01:48.270> an<00:01:48.450> annihilation<00:01:48.930> where<00:01:49.649> they

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
cause an annihilation where they

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.710 
cause an annihilation where they
basically<00:01:49.860> basically<00:01:50.670> gets<00:01:51.270> thermonuclear

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
basically basically gets thermonuclear

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.039 
basically basically gets thermonuclear
explosion<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.939> but<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
explosion and but you can make it you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
explosion and but you can make it you
can<00:01:55.170> make<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> bounce<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.920> weak<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.250> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
can make it bounce as weak as you like
