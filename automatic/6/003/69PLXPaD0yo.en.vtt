00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.330
 domestican I explain it briefly no 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 they have they do not eat grass that is 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.930
 there that they do not move with companies 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.610
 and he and the leaders arrive as the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.619
 first and what is left over is for the rest 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.900
 of cattle can not waste time 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.330
 in chewing they have to swallow and devour 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.030

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.229
 as your dog we humans have 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.930
 a stomach capacity of 20 per 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.190
 hundred them 80 percent why 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.380
 why he has to bring fast because 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.330
 afterwards they can spend days without eating the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.520
 dams are the order of the day 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.380

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.580
 chewing time they have to swallow 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.459
