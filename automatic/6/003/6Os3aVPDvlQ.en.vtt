00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.169
 hello welcome to this video where I'm going 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.090
 to do a cobweb manicure and the 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.190
 truth is very easy very simple very 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.740
 fast and you need very few things what 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.070
 only that we will need is going to be a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 white enamel 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.450
 a black enamel and a brush 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.480
 finite 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.910
 for example how well you are doing manicure or 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.100
 of crafts and if you do not have you can 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.180
 do it with a toothpick or with your head 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.190
 of a pin and good to tell you that the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.230
 I'm going to use it to make the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.540
 I will use the web and the white 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.190
 as a base I have chosen these colors 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.910
 because I think maybe a little 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.250
 more typical but if you like the design and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.080
 I like to do it with other colors as 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.510
 that advice of contrasting colors 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.220
 a lot like these I've even seen that 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.160
 It is very nice also with the base in 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.230
 yellow and black the cobweb or 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.510
 backwards I advise you to take colors that 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.820
 combine and contrast quite a bit between 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.910
 yes the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.220
 paint the base of the nail white 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.740
 we will give one or two layers depending on the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.759
 enamel that we have this that we have 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 a special enamel so to speak for 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.729
 French that is to say is a very very enamel 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.880
 very white so with one pass I'm going 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.580
 to get a uniform white so in 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.330
 my case with one with one pass with a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.410
 cap 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.200
 It will be enough, however, if it is not 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.250
 your case we would give another capita and already 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 is 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.890
 now you see when I make the fabric of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.950
 spider but you can do it in several 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.800
 sites you can make the spiderweb 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.660
 leave the center down below 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.150
 up but to me how I like it 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.010
 it's from one side down and it's 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.890
 like I'm going to do it but then you can 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.930
 adapt it as you like 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.930
 I'm going to take a quantity of black 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.780
 and I'm going to put it here to make it more 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.780
 comfortable working with her 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 A) Yes 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.190
 and I'm going to start drawing straight lines 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.190
 that will go from here to here 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.650
 So you see the first good, now I'm going 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.040
 to make two more plus one here and another 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.040
 here 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.310
 and I'm going to make the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.430
 first 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.440
 if we make them longer or shorter 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.430
 is going to be based on the size that 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.050
 We want you to have our web and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.930
 as not also depending on the size 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.980
 have our nails, well, let's go 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.900
 can make them longer or shorter 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.640
 good as you see I have these nails 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.150
 now just what I 'm going to go 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.019
 doing is to join them with arcs that is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.159
 I'm going to make bows like that like that 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.159
 now you are going to see it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.099
 I'm going to make a bow here 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.099
 another here 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.940
 another here 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.050
 and another one here and already when I've done certain 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.390
 high achieved step a little lower 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:32.360
 and I do exactly the same 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.360
 one bow or the other below 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.670
 other 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.640
 and another one and I'm going to extend it a bit more 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.210
 this 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.150
 and I'm going to make another row of bows because 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.069
 good to leave it with two I think for 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.790
 this type of nails is better with three 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.100
 nevertheless you join with him or 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.430
 play with maybe not leave so much 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.260
 space between a row of arcs and others 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.670
 and well, adapt it a bit to 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.459
 your tastes 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.290
 You can make it thinner fatter but 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.090
 that is a matter of once 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.489
 We have practice and we know how to do it 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.480
 you can make it a little more special to 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.819
 How will we like it? 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.699
 good and the result that we get then 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.040
 is this you have already seen that it does not take 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.199
 nothing big colors are not needed 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.610
 either enamel or anything like that 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.160
 We can do with any color that 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.760
 we have at home and that the result then 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.340
 the truth is very beautiful and it's pretty 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.310
 all right 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.770
 this is how it would be and as an option what 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.260
 what you can do is but to me the truth 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.340
 I like it better so it's simpler but 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.889
 if someone likes you can catch 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.889
 take a finite thread from somewhere 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.620
 that falls down and make here a 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.840
 kind of fatter point 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.080
 that with what's left of the brush we give 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.180
 some reviews on the sides and you see that it was 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.729
 as if I had incorporated the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.010
 spider just making a stick 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.460
 down a little circle and this that 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.710
 it seems in legs it's just that 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.020
 cleaned the rest of brush on the sides 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.590
 I have not painted four legs and four 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.350
 legs but I have cleaned as you see the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.080
 brush and paws effect so 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.360
 you have two options only the cobweb or 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.400
 with spider is included very easy very 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.570
 simple and if you want I encourage you to 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.570
 try it to do you
