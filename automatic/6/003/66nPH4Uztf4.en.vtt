00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
a man by his shoes so for her that was

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.020 
a man by his shoes so for her that was
validation<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.190> individual<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.000> i

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
validation that the individual that i

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.540 
validation that the individual that i
was<00:02:30.240> talking<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.630> or<00:02:31.320> communicating<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.220> was

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
was talking to or communicating with was

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150 
was talking to or communicating with was
indeed<00:02:32.910> her<00:02:33.060> death<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> never<00:02:34.800> sort<00:02:35.070> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
indeed her death so I never sort of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740 
indeed her death so I never sort of
understand<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> images<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.270> get<00:02:36.540> but

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
understand the images that I get but

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.120 
understand the images that I get but
they<00:02:36.840> usually<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.260> perfect<00:02:37.650> sense<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
they usually make perfect sense to the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.850 
they usually make perfect sense to the
client<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.360> an<00:02:39.510> opportunity<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:40.260> closure

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
client it is an opportunity for closure

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.570 
client it is an opportunity for closure
for<00:02:41.190> people<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.330> opportunity<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:44.400> have

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
for people it is an opportunity to have

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.210 
for people it is an opportunity to have
some<00:02:44.880> sense<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.390> maybe<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:46.770> is<00:02:46.950> something

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
some sense that maybe there is something

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.449 
some sense that maybe there is something
beyond<00:02:47.760> our<00:02:47.970> physical<00:02:48.060> world<00:02:49.010> that's<00:02:50.010> not<00:02:50.250> for

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
beyond our physical world that's not for

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.640 
beyond our physical world that's not for
everybody's<00:02:51.000> belief<00:02:51.300> system<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.930> can<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.620> very

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
everybody's belief system it can be very

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
everybody's belief system it can be very
challenging<00:02:53.100> for<00:02:53.489> some<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.959> others<00:02:55.290> it's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
challenging for some and for others it's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.150 
challenging for some and for others it's
an<00:02:55.970> incredible<00:02:56.970> sense<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:58.050> relief<00:02:58.830> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
an incredible sense of relief and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.750 
an incredible sense of relief and
connection<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:01.560> sense<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.370> know

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
connection and the sense that you know

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.240 
connection and the sense that you know
that<00:03:03.060> their<00:03:03.270> person<00:03:03.989> who<00:03:04.110> has<00:03:04.320> died<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.890> still

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
that their person who has died is still

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.760 
that their person who has died is still
there<00:03:05.459> still<00:03:05.730> around<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:07.200> still<00:03:07.470> making

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
there still around and it's still making

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.699 
there still around and it's still making
some<00:03:08.280> sort<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.640> connection<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.239> them<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.650> it

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
some sort of connection with them so it

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.650 
some sort of connection with them so it
can<00:03:10.860> be<00:03:10.980> an<00:03:11.130> extremely<00:03:11.370> comforting<00:03:12.180> process

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
can be an extremely comforting process

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.690 
can be an extremely comforting process
but<00:03:13.200> again<00:03:13.320> it's<00:03:13.590> not<00:03:13.770> for<00:03:14.010> everybody<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
but again it's not for everybody and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.400 
but again it's not for everybody and
it's<00:03:15.239> also<00:03:15.510> something<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.380> be

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
it's also something that can be

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.039 
it's also something that can be
extremely<00:03:16.890> challenging<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:18.049> people's

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
extremely challenging for people's

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.920 
extremely challenging for people's
belief<00:03:19.440> system<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:21.000> me<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.630> very

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
belief system and for me it's it's very

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.440 
belief system and for me it's it's very
much<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.200> making<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.070> phone<00:03:23.310> call<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.760> start
