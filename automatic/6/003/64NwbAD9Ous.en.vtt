really<00:03:09.939> good<00:03:10.030> shot<00:03:10.269> at<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.860> individual

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
really good shot at the individual

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.369 
really good shot at the individual

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
toward a national a national

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.789 
toward a national a national
championship<00:03:16.420> last<00:03:16.840> year<00:03:17.140> we<00:03:17.379> came<00:03:17.560> up<00:03:17.709> a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.020 
championship last year we came up a
little<00:03:17.860> bit<00:03:18.099> short<00:03:18.129> but<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.549> think<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.909> this

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
little bit short but I think that this

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.880 
little bit short but I think that this
is<00:03:19.150> our<00:03:19.299> year<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:20.079> definitely<00:03:20.260> our

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
is our year so that's definitely our

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.049 
is our year so that's definitely our
everybody's<00:03:21.790> number<00:03:22.180> one<00:03:22.329> goal<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.659> this<00:03:22.780> team
