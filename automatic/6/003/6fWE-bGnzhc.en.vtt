00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
know is very powerful and had a level up

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
know is very powerful and had a level up
over<00:00:47.129> hecarim<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.850> ignite<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.149> he

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
over hecarim but they ignite that he

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
brings the leg gives him that type of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
brings the leg gives him that type of
pressure<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.600> make<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
pressure to get in there and make that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
pressure to get in there and make that
kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> come<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.489> saw<00:00:54.059> him<00:00:54.239> slowly

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
kind of come back so we saw him slowly

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
kind of come back so we saw him slowly
but<00:00:54.809> surely<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.170> thought<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.410> gonna<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
but surely I thought was gonna be

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.529 
but surely I thought was gonna be
another<00:00:55.800> game<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.340> hunter<00:00:57.000> like

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
another game where I'm like hunter like

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
another game where I'm like hunter like

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
absolutely nothing for you there was a
substantial<00:01:27.930> amount<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.770> time<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> he<00:01:29.369> was

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
substantial amount of time that he was

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.130 
substantial amount of time that he was
there<00:01:29.729> without<00:01:30.119> anything<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:31.020> even

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
there without anything to do they even

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
there without anything to do they even
rotated<00:01:31.710> st.<00:01:31.979> over<00:01:32.369> only<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.329> the

rotated st. over only then to make the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
rotated st. over only then to make the
realization<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.500> wasn't<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
realization that that wasn't going to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
realization that that wasn't going to
help<00:01:35.100> either<00:01:35.250> yeah<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.390> st.<00:01:36.630> just

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
help either yeah and then then st. just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.359 
help either yeah and then then st. just
doesn't<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.500> experience<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> point

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
doesn't get an experience at that point

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
doesn't get an experience at that point
but<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.640> later<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.000> st.<00:01:39.930> happened<00:01:40.229> did<00:01:40.320> a

but then later on st. happened did a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.260 
but then later on st. happened did a
really<00:01:40.590> good<00:01:40.710> job<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.579> pairing<00:01:42.119> up

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
little bit is the idea that gravity

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.850 
little bit is the idea that gravity
seems<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.599> catching<00:02:09.750> their<00:02:10.050> opponents<00:02:10.739> off

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

seems to be catching their opponents off
guard<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.520> bit<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.239> fact<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
guard a little bit with the fact that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.460 
guard a little bit with the fact that
they<00:02:12.780> have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
they have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530 
they have

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
dynamic those catching everybody all

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.960 
dynamic those catching everybody all
right<00:02:18.060> whoa<00:02:18.900> Nova<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.610> that's

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
right whoa Nova and but but I that's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.460 
right whoa Nova and but but I that's
part<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.390> point<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.380> they

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
part of my point actually is that they

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
part of my point actually is that they
brought<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> fizz<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:24.180> flex<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> heck

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
brought out the fizz they flex the heck

room right they bring out the fizz but

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.250 
room right they bring out the fizz but
they<00:02:26.520> put<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.880> mid<00:02:27.060> lane<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.510> they<00:02:27.870> build<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
they put it mid lane and they build it

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.650 
they put it mid lane and they build it
kind<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.500> bruiser<00:02:28.770> EAP<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.670> although<00:02:30.030> he

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
kind of bruiser EAP and although he

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.540 
kind of bruiser EAP and although he
wasn't<00:02:30.930> having<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.500> ton<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.860> success<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
wasn't having a ton of success and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.670 
wasn't having a ton of success and
actually<00:02:33.030> securing<00:02:33.540> pills<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.350> mid<00:02:34.530> lane

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
actually securing pills in the mid lane

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.620 
actually securing pills in the mid lane
right<00:02:34.800> they<00:02:34.950> had<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.370> few<00:02:35.730> attempted<00:02:36.240> ganks

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
right they had the few attempted ganks

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
right they had the few attempted ganks
in<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.780> mid<00:02:36.900> lane<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.380> seems<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.280> people

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
in the mid lane it seems like people

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
in the mid lane it seems like people
aren't<00:02:38.970> quite<00:02:39.210> sure<00:02:39.240> how<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.840> deal<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.500> these

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
aren't quite sure how to deal with these

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.470 
aren't quite sure how to deal with these
things<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:41.550> an<00:02:41.730> advantage<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
things and that's an advantage in and of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.030 
things and that's an advantage in and of
itself<00:02:42.630> without<00:02:43.050> having<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> actually<00:02:43.710> get

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
itself without having to actually get

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.160 
itself without having to actually get
the<00:02:44.070> kills<00:02:44.490> off<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.940> ya<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.630> individual

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
the kills off of ya so the individual

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.570 
the kills off of ya so the individual
play<00:02:46.350> there<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.860> course<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.340> another

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
play there of course it was another

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.270 
play there of course it was another
