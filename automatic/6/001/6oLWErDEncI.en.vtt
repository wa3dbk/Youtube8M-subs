00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to be having those blinking things maybe

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.760 
to be having those blinking things maybe
this<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.229> start<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> blink

touka-sama<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.430> nobody<00:01:56.790> ever<00:01:56.909> does<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
touka-sama have nobody ever does it that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.350 
touka-sama have nobody ever does it that
is<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.759> bit<00:01:59.939> reality

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
is I think it's a little bit reality

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.690 
is I think it's a little bit reality
ship<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> house<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> normal

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
ship this out with a house is the normal

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
ship this out with a house is the normal
stomach<00:02:02.969> cable<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.810> charge<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.380> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
stomach cable so you can charge it I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.850 
stomach cable so you can charge it I
think<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.280> load<00:02:05.430> random<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.320> yeah

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think that's a load random to be yeah

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580 
think that's a load random to be yeah
that<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.479> wrong<00:02:09.660> another

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that it is a little bit wrong another

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.020 
that it is a little bit wrong another
thing<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.920> they've<00:02:11.039> done<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.489> one

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
thing that they've done this one

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.320 
thing that they've done this one
these<00:02:12.630> stand<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.290> more<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.940> good

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
these stand out more which is a good

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
these stand out more which is a good
thing<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.380> get<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> little<00:02:16.800> bit<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
thing so you get a little bit of a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.110 
thing so you get a little bit of a
better<00:02:17.370> grip<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.209> seems<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:19.260> least<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.709> do

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
better grip here it seems at least I do

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.540 
better grip here it seems at least I do
but<00:02:21.120> not<00:02:22.020> sure<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:22.410> I'll<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.740> him<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.069> lot<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.400> I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
but not sure if I'll like him a lot if I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.100 
but not sure if I'll like him a lot if I
would<00:02:23.700> compare<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.150> against<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> Xbox<00:02:24.840> one

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
would compare them against the Xbox one

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.860 
would compare them against the Xbox one
which<00:02:25.620> seems<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.010> having<00:02:26.280> bigger<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
which seems to be having bigger on the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.340 
which seems to be having bigger on the
back

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
back

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.910 
back
