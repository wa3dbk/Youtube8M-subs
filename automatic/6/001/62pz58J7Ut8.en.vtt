 name and the sprint race 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 and the meaning of it seems to be 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.420
 that we have to go through all the parkour tests 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.880
 as quickly as possible and come to the finish 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.880

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.470
 in general, all three of us have 5 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.300
 mode and and when we jump and if fell 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.910
 we can return to the previous block with 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.980
 which we fell but it will not be possible 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.460
