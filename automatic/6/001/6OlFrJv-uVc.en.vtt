00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.270
 Jesus is an extremely attractive final 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.429
 I think football that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 ideal and with all due respect for toluca and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.000
 for some saints it seems that others 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 teams come in great shape that have 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 had a recovery in the past 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 two years you take the management of the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.830
 difficult moments of divisions of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.160
 I've done it wonderfully 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.500
 america also finds in addition to its 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.599
 great media weight as an inertia 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 in the title and there is much interest to see 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.099
 this final we are perfectly that lion 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 transmits to their matches on television 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.790
 restricted 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.500
 on this occasion jesus there is some 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.390
 alternative for people who do not have 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.570
 pay television and given the interest 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.000
 public that awakens the combination 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.520
 america lion have alternatives or not 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.309
 there are yes francisco by no doubt like 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.410
 you mentioned a match really very 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.020
 important, I also think that the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.780
 two teams have done things well is 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.480
 the basis of the selection to combine the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.789
 two types two technicians who like 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920
 play football well they like 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.140
 attack but that the ingredients are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.030
 there 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.220
 Any fan who likes the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.080
 football is going to dispute this final in 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.960
 As for your question then how much 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.020
 to your question really I on my part 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.440
 I have a contract with the fox chain 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.960
 sports with head to one tv and we know 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.540
 that this decision was taken in benefit 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.490
 of the club since they did not give us what 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.640
 that we thought was right 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.440
 for the project that we give but now you 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.869
 I can say that we also have a 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.330
 contract with halftime.com in which 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.670
 is going to be online is going to be the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.140
 free game today we know that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 there are many accesses 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.729
 there are many people who have access 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.430
 to the internet and on that side to be access 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.770
 free of the other side I answer that 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.700
 I have a contract with them and that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.750
 it depends on them the decision that they take 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 correct but Leon would see some 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.020
 alternative some negotiation some 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.690
 some way to get it to the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.769
 people who do not have internet or have 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.840
 pay television jesus tell you that what 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.180
 had very complicated due to what 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.030
 with practical effect that this contract 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.150
 that we have is exclusively 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.910
 with them and they are the ones who take the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.010
 decisions so in my hands is not 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.170
 well, very well, let's talk 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.080
 with your friends this matter that we do 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 with jesús martínez about the forecast in 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.440
 television and I understand very well that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.810
 pachuca has a contract with a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.420
 pay television like we are 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.849
 us in tvn and lion 'that regularly 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.329
 the lion forgive me if your group pachuca 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.569
 lion go before the association of ideas 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.010
 This has already become clear that it is not in its 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.140
 hands that there is a contract to respect 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 I of course respect that without 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.110
 But I do not know if there was any way 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.239
 so that through different ways there 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.950
 there are several alternatives more people what 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.959
 there could be if it's a final that generates 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.250
 a lot of explanation and yes it seems to me that 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.920
 is that it is something that has an interest 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.940
 public for example at the cup level of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.980
 world the selections that is to say is 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.170
 an event that every day more also 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.120
 supports restricted television 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.500
 countries of the selection in question for 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.920
 the country you buy rights have to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.260
 be 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.910
 forcibly by open television here 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.520
 there is no regulation that we know in that 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.800
 nature what I wanted is hopefully 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.870
 you could find some solution 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.849
 because many people are going to be left without 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.890
 watch the game because watts because not 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.110
 the entire population has television 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.060
 pay as the whole population can 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.730
 see tdn or you can see channels from this 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.190
 I hope that the topic is not left 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.110
 of the inkwell and that if you will explore some 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.720
 possibility I do not know which one no no no 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.950
 order of it but that is yes yes it is 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.739
 a pity that one end of this 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.670
 nature can not be seen by everything 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.830
 the potential audience 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.180
 I wish the owner of course 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.730
 of the club and the rights of 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.769
 transmission will be found together 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.590
 some formula that and here we hear the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.090
 if they are not intended 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.250
 totally respecting the contracts 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.130
 in force that they have here it seems to me that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.530
 It would be a topic of the future 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.050
 own league and let's see this 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.660
 federation with the clubs themselves 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.630
 it is about foreseeing this type of cases 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.450
 but this one already told us the president of 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.150
 lion his is the administrative field 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.520
 that people enter in a way 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.060
 ordered to give the tickets to the team 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.350
 the opposite of the lion 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.120
 is the soccer issue is not the first 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.590
 time a financial television 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.750
 will the water ever be a 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.070
 possibility with the facts of the autonomous 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.169
 of Guadalajara that were transmitted 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.290
 throughout the regular tournament for a 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.610
 company also from a restricted but 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.680
 that do not have a signature on the league 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.710
 title then came to TV 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.419
 open and this one and I pay the rights 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.389
 corresponding to the price you wanted 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.950
 tecos and they transmitted this because they 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.100
 there was a contract we wanted to get to it 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.780
 it's not that it's really going to happen from 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.729
 the lesser evils not because it is the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.410
 first match of the grand final the final 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.200
 final if you can go by open tradition 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.639
 so girl that more than one evil is clear not 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.010
 it's a good ending I always thought 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.160
 that in soccer the best article of 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.380
 marketing you have is a final 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.229
 as america blue cross is a final of 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.060
 great call is that people are 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.470
 fall in love with this game and I think the lion 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.600
 has all the ingredients for 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.979
 to love more and more people as he has 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.930
 done during his return to first 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.200
 division but he knew and it was 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.090
 simply the concern of all this in 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.810
 social networks we ask the same thing that 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.810
 at the beginning of this one
