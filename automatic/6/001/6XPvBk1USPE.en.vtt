00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.790

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.470

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.300
 harmony in our home and a Christmas 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.090
 full of positive energy 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.250
 great where you look at the first question 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.380
 would be the shower to nadal just to see 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.330
 ivonne role new and joy but also 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.030
 can review meals from home that are not 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.220
 They carry such a good roll that they can faith to 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.720
 avoid that from marchi to that this energy 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.160
 negative of people who learn to 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.160
 house that these holidays 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.370
 It is that you leave your home and family 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.900
 other people's spots the best 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.570
 way to do this is to burn incense 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.330
 before the guests arrive 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.520
 smoke always a great purifier not 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.500
 then we put a stick of incense 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.900
 at the entrance of your house and it's 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.820
 It is essential to burn it before 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.369
 our guests arrive too 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.409
 add a sprig of mistletoe on top of 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.630
 the entrance door is a symbol of 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.550
 good luck and used to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.040
 protect us from diseases and from 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.580
 bad luck and you have to give yourself a kiss to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.930
 go under clear but also 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.910
 Take the curious cases you would recommend 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 to meditate the varied to heal the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.930
 house nostra or the new one if and after 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.060
 to parties not so slow in the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.369
 census lists and media colors 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.369
 The main ones are red, green and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.770
 the golden one since in the winter the light 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.660
 solar is greatly reduced not then by 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.360
 therefore it is very positive to add colors 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.030
 like the red the purple they usually 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 to activate the energy of Christmas in 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.750
 our house the red is the color of the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.730
 good luck in china and then what 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.830
 we are going to use a lot but also 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.540
 the purple is a very powerful color that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.570
 is closely associated with color 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.190
 red and the fire element is ideal for 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.070
 stimulate the flow of cci and attract 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.320
 vitality to your house then the golden 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.660
 It is the color of wealth and 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.150
 fortune we also have to have it in 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.650
 notice that your Christmas tree predominates 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.450
 the red color in the decoration wants 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.940
 say that good luck will be of your 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.910
 side after the monthly theatrical event 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.530
 to nadal will meet seen Carmen and some 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.930
 thing more than your boss to activate the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.190
 good announcements as our 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.690
 look like fs has the five 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.700
 elements in our house we are going to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.060
 activate the five senses which is the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.430
 sight the ear the smell the taste and the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.260
 touch 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.579
 as with the colors and the new 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.040
 decoration of our house 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.099
 now we are activating the hearing sight 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.599
 activate with carols or songs 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.719
 that we put at home because it increases the 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.140
 chip the smell we will activate with the tree 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.510
 of the life 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.190
 Is the Christmas plant or candles 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.590
 aromatic on our table 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 this will also increase the energy the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.060
 we will activate it with a blanket of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.900
 sofa red socks fireplace 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 of different fabrics 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.030
 tablecloths of fine thread and finally the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.420
 We'll activate it with a good wine 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.150
 with the turkey turrones and of course 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.349
 the chocolates 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.840
 and it is also the most appropriate for 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.939
 press the speech of nadal then in the feng 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.640
 shui the tree has the relationship with the 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.530
 wood element and it's growth 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.689
 then at home what I suggest is 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.299
 place the length of the health area of the 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.189
 water from our house that is health and 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.109
 family that is governed by the element 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.849
 wood and by the green color like the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.370
 tree not so it's the perfect place 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.069
 for the Christmas tree and for 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.780
 Christmas plants another positive place 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.209
 it would be the prosperity zone of your 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.150
 dining room not for this Christmas 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.549
 let's not miss anything not come to us 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.980
 many little things another a positive home 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.799
 for example is that you do not forget in the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.139
 same tree under the tree of the 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.600
 Christmas tree put on gifts 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.519
 because it promotes good luck 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.039
 for the one who gives them as for the one who 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.440
 he receives them because we all benefit 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.880
 of such an idea of ​​receiving gifts should 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.970
 be wrapped in bright colors 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.440
 like red or gold and for 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.110
 make sure that the house does not miss 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.700
 harmony that you wear 12.6 defense and 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.410
 I know handling 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.820
 for example remove the knives 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.030
 sharp edges that are visible in the 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.830
 kitchen when placing them out of sight 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.320
 symbolically decrease the 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.880
 discussions and profitability with the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.010
 family 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.260
 another thing is always use a table 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.150
 can be oval-shaped dining room or 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.360
 round instead of a rectangular table 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.700
 or square because I put a way 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.200
 circular is a symbol of unity and 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.910
 No member of the family is 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.850
 forced to sit dominating the table 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.529
 especially avoid sitting in the angles 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.869
 Straight from the corners of the table 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.489
 also moves for these dates sofas 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:15.759
 place chairs trying to form 

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:18.099
 angles of 90 in this position is the most 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.400
 positive and above all facilitates 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.040
 communication between the family 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.130
 and for example next February 4th 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.860
 of 2014 the new Chinese year begins 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.990
 the wood horse so if we want 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.789
 have a year with good omen is 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.870
 We recommend the colors for all the 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.150
 year the whole range of green colors very 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.550
 well then of these pieces you have the 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.490
 opportunity to recharge your batteries and
