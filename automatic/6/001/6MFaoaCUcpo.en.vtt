00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.820 
character's head if I don't link the SFX
it<00:05:52.690> will<00:05:52.810> just<00:05:52.960> remain<00:05:53.260> in<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.530> same<00:05:53.680> position

it will just remain in the same position

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.230 
it will just remain in the same position
now<00:05:54.310> he<00:05:55.180> looks<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.660> lot<00:05:55.840> more<00:05:55.990> tired

duplicate tool if you want to create

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.370 
duplicate tool if you want to create
clones<00:06:31.840> of<00:06:32.110> characters<00:06:32.530> or<00:06:32.680> props<00:06:32.920> use<00:06:33.430> this

clones of characters or props use this

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.840 
clones of characters or props use this
you<00:06:35.380> can<00:06:35.500> also<00:06:35.650> modify<00:06:35.950> the<00:06:36.190> look<00:06:36.520> of<00:06:36.640> any

you can also modify the look of any

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.030 
you can also modify the look of any
character<00:06:37.300> by<00:06:37.510> resizing<00:06:37.960> distorting<00:06:38.920> or

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
character by resizing distorting or

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.750 
character by resizing distorting or
rotating<00:06:39.670> it<00:06:39.760> by<00:06:40.000> using<00:06:40.210> the<00:06:40.390> transform<00:06:40.930> tool

rotating it by using the transform tool

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.490 
rotating it by using the transform tool
the<00:06:42.760> flip<00:06:43.030> key<00:06:43.240> simply<00:06:43.690> flips<00:06:43.930> your<00:06:44.050> character

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
the flip key simply flips your character

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.719 
the flip key simply flips your character
back<00:06:44.710> and<00:06:44.920> forth

I'm going to apply a dancing animation
here<00:06:49.189> to<00:06:49.370> demonstrate<00:06:49.789> how<00:06:49.969> the<00:06:50.029> basic

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
here to demonstrate how the basic

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.869 
here to demonstrate how the basic
timeline<00:06:50.749> works<00:06:51.139> to<00:06:51.979> do<00:06:52.129> this<00:06:52.249> I'll<00:06:52.490> move<00:06:52.729> my

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:52.879 
timeline works to do this I'll move my

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.249 
timeline works to do this I'll move my
character<00:06:53.300> to<00:06:53.449> one<00:06:53.599> side<00:06:53.809> of<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:54.020> screen

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:54.259 
character to one side of the screen

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.839 
character to one side of the screen
first<00:06:55.210> I'll<00:06:56.210> choose<00:06:56.539> the<00:06:56.689> Egyptian<00:06:57.139> dance<00:06:57.849> for

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
first I'll choose the Egyptian dance for

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.670 
first I'll choose the Egyptian dance for
now<00:06:58.999> our<00:06:59.270> character<00:06:59.839> will<00:06:59.960> do<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:00.199> dance<00:07:00.439> in<00:07:00.620> a

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
now our character will do the dance in a

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.610 
now our character will do the dance in a
stationary<00:07:01.189> position<00:07:01.370> I<00:07:02.199> can<00:07:03.199> open<00:07:03.439> up<00:07:03.499> the
