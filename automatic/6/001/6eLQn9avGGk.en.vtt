00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.800 
can you see it it looks like a small one
you<00:04:28.490> should<00:04:28.759> be<00:04:28.789> able<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.210> take<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.509> down<00:04:29.690> with

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
you should be able to take it down with

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:50.950 
you should be able to take it down with
