someone requested on Twitter that I do a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.120 
someone requested on Twitter that I do a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
video on this which is the evolution

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.250 
video on this which is the evolution
temple<00:00:20.520> temple<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.210> evolution<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.080> call

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
temple temple of evolution as they call

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.750 
temple temple of evolution as they call
it<00:00:22.760> and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
it and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.500 
it and
that's<00:00:26.539> all<00:00:27.109> right<00:00:27.289> this<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.970> training

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
that's all right this is the training

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.830 
that's all right this is the training
center<00:00:29.810> I'm<00:00:30.170> gonna<00:00:30.470> be<00:00:30.529> honest<00:00:30.949> with<00:00:31.009> everyone

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
center I'm gonna be honest with everyone

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.900 
center I'm gonna be honest with everyone
that<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:32.900> playing<00:00:33.290> dragons<00:00:33.739> world<00:00:33.950> I<00:00:34.220> haven't

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
that is playing dragons world I haven't

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.420 
that is playing dragons world I haven't
used<00:00:35.090> any<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.329> them<00:00:35.510> they<00:00:36.170> are<00:00:36.199> I<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:37.220> my

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
used any of them they are I in my

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.819 
used any of them they are I in my
opinion<00:00:37.460> they're<00:00:38.090> waste<00:00:38.420> of<00:00:38.660> time<00:00:38.930> they<00:00:39.260> waste

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
opinion they're waste of time they waste

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.829 
opinion they're waste of time they waste
of<00:00:40.040> food<00:00:40.250> if<00:00:40.640> you're<00:00:40.820> only<00:00:40.940> breathing<00:00:41.300> dragon

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
of food if you're only breathing dragon

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.810 
of food if you're only breathing dragon
unless<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.170> you're<00:00:42.650> going<00:00:42.920> into<00:00:43.040> battle<00:00:43.370> then

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
unless you you're going into battle then

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.600 
unless you you're going into battle then
you<00:00:44.000> probably<00:00:44.420> care<00:00:44.809> about<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:45.290> but<00:00:46.040> here<00:00:46.580> it

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
you probably care about it but here it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.530 
you probably care about it but here it
is<00:00:48.489> essentially<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.640> got<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.910> select<00:00:50.089> a<00:00:50.360> level

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
is essentially you got to select a level

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.280 
is essentially you got to select a level
10<00:00:50.900> Dragon<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.650> then<00:00:52.519> evolve<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.050> that

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
10 Dragon and then evolve it and that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.860 
10 Dragon and then evolve it and that
what<00:00:54.470> happens<00:00:55.220> then<00:00:55.489> is<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.269> feed<00:00:56.629> your

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
what happens then is you can feed your

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.100 
what happens then is you can feed your
dragon<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.280> higher<00:00:58.610> level<00:00:59.000> or<00:00:59.300> level<00:00:59.960> them

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
dragon to a higher level or level them

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.740 
dragon to a higher level or level them
up<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.440> higher<00:01:00.620> level<00:01:00.649> rather<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.719> yeah<00:01:02.719> I

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
up to a higher level rather and yeah I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.990 
up to a higher level rather and yeah I
mean<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.350> will<00:01:03.500> cost<00:01:03.770> more<00:01:04.009> food<00:01:04.369> it'll<00:01:04.759> cost

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
mean that will cost more food it'll cost

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.359 
mean that will cost more food it'll cost
more<00:01:05.270> money<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.750> will<00:01:06.170> cost<00:01:06.380> more<00:01:06.619> time<00:01:07.039> it's

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
more money and will cost more time it's

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.120 
more money and will cost more time it's
not<00:01:07.580> really<00:01:07.880> into<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.229> breeding<00:01:09.530> stuff<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.070> do

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
not really into the breeding stuff I do

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.210 
not really into the breeding stuff I do
for<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:11.000> series<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.690> also<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
for the this series and also the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.430 
for the this series and also the
training<00:01:13.880> center<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:14.330> let's<00:01:14.899> take<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.110> look<00:01:15.350> at

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
training center so let's take a look at

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.980 
training center so let's take a look at
the<00:01:15.530> training<00:01:15.800> center<00:01:16.070> now<00:01:16.539> we<00:01:17.539> talked<00:01:17.810> about

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the training center now we talked about

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.770 
the training center now we talked about
yeah<00:01:18.350> we<00:01:18.530> just<00:01:18.710> talked<00:01:18.890> about<00:01:19.100> evolution

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
yeah we just talked about evolution

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.450 
yeah we just talked about evolution
temple<00:01:20.780> or<00:01:20.899> a<00:01:20.929> temple<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.289> evolution<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.310> you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
temple or a temple of evolution but you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.090 
temple or a temple of evolution but you
need<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.759> be<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> gun<00:01:23.270> level<00:01:24.110> 10<00:01:24.350> before<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.979> can

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
need to be a gun level 10 before you can

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
need to be a gun level 10 before you can
go<00:01:25.250> in<00:01:25.429> so<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:25.610> will<00:01:26.270> go<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.570> with<00:01:26.750> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 

all<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> loaded<00:01:38.580> finally<00:01:39.120> all<00:01:39.330> right

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
all right so it loaded finally all right

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.540 
all right so it loaded finally all right
so<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> wasn't<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:41.190> first

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
so it wasn't like this when I first

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.090 
so it wasn't like this when I first
started<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.120> think<00:01:42.300> I<00:01:42.390> made<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.870> tiny<00:01:43.470> video<00:01:43.860> on

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
started I think I made a tiny video on

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.890 
started I think I made a tiny video on
it<00:01:44.250> essentially<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.420> replace<00:01:45.840> your

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
it essentially you can replace your

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.890 
it essentially you can replace your
attacks<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:47.370> this<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.000> upgrade<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.570> or

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
attacks like this you can upgrade it or

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.950 
attacks like this you can upgrade it or
I<00:01:49.110> guess<00:01:49.620> make<00:01:50.160> it<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.430> powerful<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.960> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I guess make it more powerful and this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.920 
I guess make it more powerful and this
one<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.290> well<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.980> evolves<00:01:56.930> multiple

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
one as well it kind of evolves multiple

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
one as well it kind of evolves multiple
skills<00:01:58.320> look<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.580> cool

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
skills look at that that is pretty cool

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.570 
skills look at that that is pretty cool
except<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.020> only<00:02:01.350> problem<00:02:01.800> like<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.100> said<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.370> I

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
except the only problem like I said I I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.510 
except the only problem like I said I I
do<00:02:03.300> not<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.870> into<00:02:04.140> battle<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.590> much<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.950> only

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
do not go into battle as much I only

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.060 
do not go into battle as much I only
focus<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.150> breeding<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.620> use

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
focus on breeding so I don't really use

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.730 
focus on breeding so I don't really use
this<00:02:08.280> thing<00:02:08.929> just<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.260> of<00:02:10.290> here<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.619> go

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
this thing just go out of here and go

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.100 
this thing just go out of here and go
here<00:02:11.070> all<00:02:11.970> right<00:02:12.120> fire<00:02:12.450> breath

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
here all right fire breath

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.590 
here all right fire breath
yeah<00:02:13.800> there's<00:02:14.250> multiple<00:02:14.850> skills<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.570> I

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
yeah there's multiple skills here I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.040 
yeah there's multiple skills here I
don't<00:02:15.870> really<00:02:16.050> generally<00:02:16.680> use<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.280> because

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
don't really generally use it because

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.890 
don't really generally use it because
I'm<00:02:19.050> mostly<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.280> alright<00:02:21.060> let's<00:02:21.240> try<00:02:21.420> this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
I'm mostly just alright let's try this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.690 
I'm mostly just alright let's try this
try<00:02:22.620> tapping<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:26.040> right<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.550> goes

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
try tapping on it all right so it goes

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.230 
try tapping on it all right so it goes
from<00:02:26.880> fire<00:02:27.240> breath<00:02:27.600> one<00:02:27.959> two<00:02:28.200> fire<00:02:28.410> breath<00:02:28.709> -

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
three fire spheres and essentially it'll

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.470

alright<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:50.700> guess<00:04:51.700> we're<00:04:51.970> kind<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.450> stuck<00:04:52.919> so

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
alright I guess we're kind of stuck so

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.060 
alright I guess we're kind of stuck so
what<00:04:55.120> we're<00:04:55.240> gonna<00:04:55.360> do<00:04:55.660> is<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.260> like<00:04:56.800> this

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
what we're gonna do is just I like this

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.490 
what we're gonna do is just I like this
this<00:04:57.430> lightning<00:04:58.000> dragon<00:04:58.150> I<00:04:58.450> really<00:04:58.960> like<00:04:59.230> just

this lightning dragon I really like just

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.120 
this lightning dragon I really like just
the<00:04:59.740> color<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:00.430> let's<00:05:00.669> level<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.120> up<00:05:02.130> and

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
the color of it so let's level it up and

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.860 
the color of it so let's level it up and
then<00:05:03.310> we'll<00:05:03.430> send<00:05:03.910> it<00:05:04.060> into<00:05:04.240> temple<00:05:04.810> of

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
then we'll send it into temple of

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.630 
then we'll send it into temple of
evolution<00:05:05.470> we'll<00:05:05.620> see<00:05:05.800> how<00:05:05.919> long<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.340> takes

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
evolution we'll see how long it takes

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.880 
evolution we'll see how long it takes
but<00:05:07.180> that's<00:05:07.390> pretty<00:05:07.660> much<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:08.169> I<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.410> haven't

but that's pretty much it I I haven't
built<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:10.030> temple<00:05:10.450> of<00:05:10.480> evolution<00:05:11.050> or<00:05:11.320> the

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
built this temple of evolution or the

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.050 
built this temple of evolution or the
training<00:05:11.890> center<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.310> my<00:05:12.430> other<00:05:12.610> games<00:05:12.880> I'll

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
requested for it that is the training

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.230 
requested for it that is the training

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
center and that was the evolution or I

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.810 
center and that was the evolution or I
mean<00:05:43.450> temple<00:05:43.990> of<00:05:44.140> evolution<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:47.820> that

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
mean temple of evolution and that

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.940 
mean temple of evolution and that
concludes<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.630> for<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.140> video<00:05:50.530> if<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.860> have
