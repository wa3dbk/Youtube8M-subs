can<00:01:37.399> we<00:01:37.549> rethink<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.479> create<00:01:38.750> something

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
can we rethink that and create something

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.520 
can we rethink that and create something
that's<00:01:39.200> new<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.469> interesting<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:41.750> started

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
that's new and interesting we started

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.199 
that's new and interesting we started
getting<00:01:42.619> more<00:01:42.770> into<00:01:43.069> Zeta<00:01:43.340> symmetrical<00:01:43.909> maps

where that's a choke point that you want

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.160 
where that's a choke point that you want
to<00:01:48.590> hold<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.060> think<00:01:50.270> high<00:01:50.390> ground<00:01:50.689> is<00:01:50.899> an

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
to hold and I think high ground is an

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.760 
to hold and I think high ground is an
example<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.709> that<00:01:53.109> some<00:01:54.109> of<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.259> specific

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
things that we tried out were having a

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.870 
things that we tried out were having a
wall<00:01:56.959> that<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.500> have<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.679> get<00:01:57.799> past<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:58.459> sort

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
wall that you have to get past that sort

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.760

of defined whether you won or lost the
game<00:02:01.009> then<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:01.759> stuck<00:02:02.030> some<00:02:02.239> towers<00:02:02.720> in<00:02:02.989> and<00:02:03.560> we

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
game then we stuck some towers in and we

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.249 
game then we stuck some towers in and we
put<00:02:03.709> AI<00:02:04.099> Gunners<00:02:04.640> on<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.149> towers<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:06.170> as

version a hike on that wall has been

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.300 
version a hike on that wall has been
rotated<00:02:19.940> 45<00:02:20.450> degrees<00:02:21.049> because<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.739> had<00:02:22.010> two

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
rotated 45 degrees because it had two

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.220 
rotated 45 degrees because it had two

turrets up here as well as two turns to
the<00:02:24.319> other<00:02:24.440> tower<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.129> there's<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.459> lot<00:02:25.670> of

firepower<00:02:25.970> coming<00:02:26.599> down<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.959> hill<00:02:27.140> that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
firepower coming down on the hill that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.069 
firepower coming down on the hill that
got<00:02:28.400> Paul's<00:02:28.640> simplified<00:02:29.209> into<00:02:29.569> one<00:02:29.810> turret

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
got Paul's simplified into one turret

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.110 
got Paul's simplified into one turret
actually<00:02:30.709> right<00:02:30.890> above<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.250> gate<00:02:31.459> which<00:02:31.879> I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
actually right above the gate which I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.879 
actually right above the gate which I
felt<00:02:32.420> was<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:32.750> as<00:02:32.900> critical<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.799> the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
felt was not as critical to the

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.330 
felt was not as critical to the
attackers<00:02:35.079> it's<00:02:36.079> pretty<00:02:36.319> obvious<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.889> us<00:02:37.040> when

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
attackers it's pretty obvious to us when

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.949 
attackers it's pretty obvious to us when
when<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.790> start<00:02:38.000> working<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.420> these<00:02:38.540> maps<00:02:38.750> that

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
when we start working on these maps that

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.470 
when we start working on these maps that
they<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.440> be<00:02:39.560> fun<00:02:39.859> for<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.850> hundreds<00:02:41.209> and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
they have to be fun for the hundreds and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.090 
they have to be fun for the hundreds and
the<00:02:41.600> two<00:02:42.019> hundreds<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> thousands<00:02:43.010> of

the two hundreds and the thousands of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.750 
the two hundreds and the thousands of
time<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.799> are<00:02:45.920> figuring<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.549> switches

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
time you are figuring up the switches

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.720 
time you are figuring up the switches
and<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> doors<00:02:47.150> we<00:02:47.389> had<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.750> closer<00:02:48.019> like

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
and the doors we had the closer like

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.620 
and the doors we had the closer like
watching<00:02:49.730> people<00:02:49.849> run<00:02:50.030> through<00:02:50.329> your<00:02:50.450> map

watching people run through your map

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.150 
watching people run through your map
challenges<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.290> lot<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> assumptions<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
challenges a lot of the assumptions you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.589 
challenges a lot of the assumptions you
made<00:02:52.340> about<00:02:52.579> it<00:02:52.639> like<00:02:52.849> oh<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.000> think<00:02:53.150> people

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
made about it like oh I think people

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.740 
made about it like oh I think people
would<00:02:53.720> use<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.200> hill<00:02:54.380> for<00:02:54.880> sniping<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.569> then

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
would use this hill for sniping and then

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.629 
would use this hill for sniping and then
no<00:02:56.900> one<00:02:57.019> uses<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.310> get<00:02:58.400> great

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
no one uses it then you get great

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.770 
no one uses it then you get great
