00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.930
 to Crimea 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.990
 sell more defeat 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.049
 Senina 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.199
 that today there were so many moments 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.289
 opportunities shome noticed gate but 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.439
 nobody flew you tons this is somewhere else 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.359
 in principle, we played today 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.999
 so wanted amkar allowed 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.060
 all of course changed this goal from the standard 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.539
 became a cripple Tomsk citizens 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.710
 then they defended bills oms 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.189
 tried hard 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.240
 forced to attack 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.430
 it turned out as it happened 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.100
 set up very important 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.220
 and I'm on the content of the best ball intimate 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.940
 $ 0 points went home all 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430
 upset mood 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.660
 there were no serious thoughts about 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.530
 what's in the game 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.960
 with a dynamo with a decent game also 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 fortune was on the side of mother 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.890
 Today, April 8, was such a case with us 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.460
 taught five main points 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.840
 Fuchs probably scored from standards 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.900
 with dynamo 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.990
 and the entire quota for two matches I hope that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.930
 this year and a half 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.580
 samovar fortune will she that earlier 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.390
 the right thinks that we wanted what 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.550
 played on it plus but 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.720
 as the saying goes 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.320
 however, content alone is not 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.420
 will you train that the leak was in your pocket 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.120
 we will work there is time 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 thanks to this system more than others 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.340
 upset so did not make ends like this 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.190
 here you are why this happens when not 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.520
 flies such things 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.400
 hard to tell everything 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 but surely 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 the main reason is of course 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.410
 not the fact that my husband has a ton of dream workouts 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.490
 there is flowing here these are scoring so 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.630
 what happened 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.799
 developers mitos tested where 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.979
 stood engaged except impossible 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.210
 cannot be explained any more 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.660
 so i need to get upset need 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.420
 work to correct 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090
 the more we work the more 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 will be obtained therefore we do not have 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.680
 I hope in the next game 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.240
 this will not happen again 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.200
 surely they were ready for what he would be 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 play differently than the dynamo fell in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160
 mainly worked on defense 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.389
 opening recipes invited the opposite 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.639
 Yes, of course we analyzed the game and it was 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.949
 it's clear that 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.349
 in the first second half cracked them 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.799
 nato defense 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.040
 and we tried to take advantage 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.349
 new terminal to 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.979
 intersection 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.419
 we didnâ€™t manage it 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:30.099
 it was once again 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.769
 today and on the football bomb and 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.829
 our efforts 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.099
 this moment of the match it became clear that not our 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.129
 day till the very end they believed that we 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.949
 excellent and 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.170
 and people left need to play all the time 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.370
 yes the final whistle no matter how much 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.239
 several 6 thousand 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 but we believed to the end to believe in ourselves 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.529
 and in victory 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:52.919
 did not work out
