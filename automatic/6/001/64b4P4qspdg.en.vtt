00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to put wet stuff with salt so the first

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.190 
to put wet stuff with salt so the first
step<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> grind<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> food

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
step here is to grind this in a food

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
step here is to grind this in a food
processor<00:00:49.460> with<00:00:50.460> coarse<00:00:50.969> sea<00:00:51.570> salt<00:00:51.600> alright

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
processor with coarse sea salt alright

processor with coarse sea salt alright
this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.530> too<00:00:52.800> coarse<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> eat<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this is too coarse to eat as is but this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
this is too coarse to eat as is but this
larger<00:00:55.199> size<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.739> actually<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> help<00:00:56.579> us

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
larger size is actually going to help us

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
larger size is actually going to help us
pulverize<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> herb<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.100> we're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
pulverize all that herb and then we're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
pulverize all that herb and then we're
going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> mix<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.760> salt<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.570> second

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
going to mix it with salt in the second

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.779 
going to mix it with salt in the second
step<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.430> half

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

fairly large crystal get that a couple
pulses<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> you're<00:01:38.759> done<00:01:38.939> how

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
pulses on and off and you're done how

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.190 
pulses on and off and you're done how
easy<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.409> fresh<00:01:41.189> herb<00:01:41.700> salt<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:43.020> going

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
easy is that fresh herb salt I'm going

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.190 
easy is that fresh herb salt I'm going
to<00:01:43.259> pour<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.649> into<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.280> baking<00:01:45.060> dish<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:46.020> let

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to pour it out into a baking dish to let

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
to pour it out into a baking dish to let
it<00:01:46.320> dry<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.829> little<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.820> those<00:01:47.970> herbs

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it dry out a little bit now those herbs

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.679 
it dry out a little bit now those herbs
were<00:01:48.450> dry<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.759> they<00:01:50.759> still<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.149> moisture<00:01:51.570> in

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
were dry but they still have moisture in

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.179 
were dry but they still have moisture in
them<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.799> leave<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
them so what I like to do is leave this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
them so what I like to do is leave this
out<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> tray<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> pan<00:01:54.899> for

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
out on a tray like this or a pan for

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.069 
out on a tray like this or a pan for
maybe<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:56.280> three<00:01:56.520> hours<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
maybe two three hours just out in the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
maybe two three hours just out in the
open<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:59.040> will<00:01:59.159> help<00:01:59.310> evaporate<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
open and that will help evaporate a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.639 
open and that will help evaporate a
little<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.600> moisture<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
little bit of that moisture so this is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.260 
little bit of that moisture so this is
called<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.040> finishing<00:02:02.399> salt<00:02:02.820> mean<00:02:03.030> it
