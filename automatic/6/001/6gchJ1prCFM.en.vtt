drain pipe so in order to get it out
we've<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> cut<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.210> pipe

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.620

now dimension wise it is 48 inches wide

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.630 
now dimension wise it is 48 inches wide
which<00:00:32.349> is<00:00:32.379> perfect<00:00:33.100> because<00:00:33.160> that's<00:00:33.460> exactly

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
which is perfect because that's exactly

to<00:00:49.690> mark<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.230> floor<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.239> break<00:00:52.239> away<00:00:52.390> this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
to mark this floor and break away this

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.569 
to mark this floor and break away this
tile<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.260> substrate<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.890> get<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.159> new<00:00:54.309> base

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
tile and substrate to get the new base

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.710 
tile and substrate to get the new base
down<00:00:54.909> onto<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.390> subfloor<00:00:56.730> okay<00:00:57.730> look<00:00:58.510> at<00:00:58.600> this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
down onto the subfloor okay look at this

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.770 
down onto the subfloor okay look at this
here<00:00:58.930> though<00:00:59.049> look<00:00:59.290> at<00:01:00.960> ya<00:01:01.989> just<00:01:02.440> as<00:01:02.589> my<00:01:02.739> guest

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
here though look at ya just as my guest

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.350 
here though look at ya just as my guest
this<00:01:04.780> pipe<00:01:05.110> actually<00:01:05.409> stands<00:01:05.860> proud<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.820> the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
this pipe actually stands proud of the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140 
this pipe actually stands proud of the
studs<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:08.049> now<00:01:09.010> it<00:01:09.280> means<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.640> we<00:01:09.760> can't<00:01:10.000> get

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
studs so now it means that we can't get

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.030 
studs so now it means that we can't get
this<00:01:10.330> all<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.720> way<00:01:10.810> back<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.290> base<00:01:11.500> but<00:01:11.860> also

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
this all the way back the base but also

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.920 
this all the way back the base but also
means<00:01:12.369> we<00:01:12.610> won't<00:01:12.820> be<00:01:12.939> able<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.150> get<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.510> cement

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
means we won't be able to get the cement

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.760 
means we won't be able to get the cement
board<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:15.189> span<00:01:15.549> between<00:01:15.790> stud<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.689> stud<00:01:16.770> all

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
board to span between stud to stud all

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.649 
board to span between stud to stud all
right<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.189> we're<00:01:18.549> going<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.729> have<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.119> just<00:01:19.360> pad

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.510 
through here and then there's a gasket
right<00:02:18.010> there<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.810> enough<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.130> want<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
right there and enough we just want to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.880 
right there and enough we just want to
tighten<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:21.970> really<00:02:22.360> well<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.770> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
tighten it up really well and this is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.170 
tighten it up really well and this is
really<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> most<00:02:27.310> important<00:02:27.819> step<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.150> to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
really the most important step is to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.390 
really the most important step is to
make<00:02:28.390> sure<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.720> base<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.230> level<00:02:29.680> now<00:02:30.100> front

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
make sure this base is level now front

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.190 
make sure this base is level now front
to<00:02:30.490> back<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.060> was<00:02:31.180> pitched<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> front

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
to back if it was pitched to the front

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.070 
to back if it was pitched to the front
water<00:02:33.100> might<00:02:33.370> run<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.970> drop<00:02:34.510> down<00:02:34.750> into<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
water might run and drop down into the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.320 
water might run and drop down into the
floor<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:36.010> was<00:02:36.129> pitched<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> back<00:02:36.909> like

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
floor it was pitched to the back like

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.539 
floor it was pitched to the back like
this<00:02:37.629> water<00:02:38.319> could<00:02:38.560> pool<00:02:38.830> at<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.129> back<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
this water could pool at the back of the

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.670 
this water could pool at the back of the
base<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.390> we're<00:02:40.569> good<00:02:40.720> front<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.140> back<00:02:41.349> but

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
base so we're good front to back but

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.710 
base so we're good front to back but
when<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> saw<00:02:42.459> looking<00:02:42.790> around<00:02:42.879> from<00:02:43.390> side<00:02:43.689> to
