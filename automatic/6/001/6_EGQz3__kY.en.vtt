English linguistics and together we'll

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.650 
English linguistics and together we'll

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
explore the English language and we look

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.360 
explore the English language and we look
at<00:03:06.840> English<00:03:07.230> from<00:03:07.440> three<00:03:07.860> different

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
at English from three different

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.350 
at English from three different
perspectives

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
perspectives

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.259 
perspectives
the<00:03:10.080> first<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.620> we'll<00:03:11.100> look<00:03:11.310> at<00:03:11.519> English<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.120> an

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
the first is we'll look at English as an

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.809 
the first is we'll look at English as an
abstract<00:03:12.750> system<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:14.130> consists<00:03:14.730> of

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
abstract system that consists of

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.850 
abstract system that consists of
different<00:03:15.269> elements<00:03:15.720> which<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.110> combine<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
different elements which can combine to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.979 
different elements which can combine to
form<00:03:16.890> larger<00:03:17.519> elements<00:03:17.970> which<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:18.780> work

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
form larger elements which then work

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.350 
form larger elements which then work
together<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.190> bit<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.579> looking<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
together it's a bit like looking at the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000 
together it's a bit like looking at the
motor<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.900> car<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.470> trying<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.980> identify

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
motor of a car and trying to identify

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.229 
motor of a car and trying to identify
its<00:03:23.760> components<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.630> how<00:03:25.200> they<00:03:25.350> interact<00:03:26.239> we

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
its components and how they interact we

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.580 
its components and how they interact we
also<00:03:27.420> look<00:03:27.870> at<00:03:27.959> English<00:03:28.350> from<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
also look at English from the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.610 
also look at English from the
perspective<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.519> tool<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.810> how<00:03:31.079> we<00:03:31.140> use

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
perspective of a tool that is how we use

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.370 
perspective of a tool that is how we use
English<00:03:32.060> for<00:03:33.060> instance<00:03:33.450> how<00:03:33.660> English<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.019> used

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
English for instance how English is used

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.420 
English for instance how English is used
to<00:03:35.160> influence<00:03:35.610> people<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.120> politics<00:03:36.660> and

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
to influence people and politics and

to influence people and politics and
advertising<00:03:38.750> finally<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:40.110> also<00:03:40.260> look<00:03:40.530> at

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
advertising finally we also look at

advertising finally we also look at
