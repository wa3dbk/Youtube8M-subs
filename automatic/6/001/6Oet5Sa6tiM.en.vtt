part of the part of the body is part of
a<00:06:01.259> problem<00:06:02.259> my<00:06:02.680> mom<00:06:03.029> part<00:06:04.029> of<00:06:04.150> hook<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:05.860> let's

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
a problem my mom part of hook so let's

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.379 
a problem my mom part of hook so let's
go<00:06:06.370> ahead<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.520> take<00:06:06.639> one<00:06:06.789> of<00:06:06.849> the<00:06:06.939> arms<00:06:07.120> off

here and I'll show you how this

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.950 
here and I'll show you how this
transforms<00:06:09.099> so<00:06:09.939> we've<00:06:10.150> got<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.389> hand<00:06:10.659> the

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
transforms so we've got the hand the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.649 
transforms so we've got the hand the
hand<00:06:10.990> comes<00:06:11.409> off<00:06:11.759> it<00:06:12.759> just<00:06:12.819> slides<00:06:13.240> off<00:06:13.449> like

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
hand comes off it just slides off like

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.519 
hand comes off it just slides off like
this<00:06:13.870> and<00:06:14.319> then<00:06:14.949> we<00:06:15.370> fold<00:06:16.060> it<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.419> there<00:06:17.349> is<00:06:17.379> a

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
this and then we fold it and there is a

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.860 
this and then we fold it and there is a
little<00:06:17.830> peg<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:19.300> you<00:06:19.389> got<00:06:19.509> a<00:06:19.539> missile

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
little peg and you got a missile
