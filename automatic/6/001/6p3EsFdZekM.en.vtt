drop your cell phone or electronic

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.620 
drop your cell phone or electronic
device<00:00:15.139> in<00:00:16.139> water<00:00:16.609> so<00:00:17.609> obviously<00:00:18.029> water<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
device in water so obviously water is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.050 
device in water so obviously water is
bad<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.199> electronics<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
bad for electronics so get it out of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.040 
bad for electronics so get it out of
there<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.330> quickly<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:23.750> use<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
there as quickly as you can use like a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.130 
there as quickly as you can use like a
rag<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.220> kind<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> cloth<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.359> dry<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
rag or some kind of a cloth to dry it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.860 
rag or some kind of a cloth to dry it
off<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.740> if<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.180> device<00:00:33.510> lets

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
off and if you can if if the device lets

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500 
off and if you can if if the device lets
you<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> take<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> apart<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you do this take it apart take out the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.310 
you do this take it apart take out the
battery<00:00:37.100> take<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> SIM<00:00:38.640> card<00:00:39.230> take<00:00:40.230> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
battery take out the SIM card take out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
battery take out the SIM card take out
the<00:00:40.410> memory<00:00:40.649> card<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:41.280> take<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the memory card just take out all the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.740 
the memory card just take out all the
pieces<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> best

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
pieces you can and so one of the best

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.369 
pieces you can and so one of the best
ways<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.960> dry<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.379> off<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:48.140> stick<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ways to dry it off is to stick all the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.889 
ways to dry it off is to stick all the
parts<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.399> bag<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.940> rice<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> rice<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
parts in a bag of rice so the rice is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.779 
parts in a bag of rice so the rice is
going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.879> go<00:00:56.879> absorb<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:58.489> mix<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
going to go absorb the water mix it in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.110 
going to go absorb the water mix it in
there

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.410 

and<00:01:04.760> sleep<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.940> in<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.860> about<00:01:08.420> 24-48

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and sleep it in there for about 24-48

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.370 
and sleep it in there for about 24-48
hours

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.320 

make<00:01:13.380> sure<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> airtight<00:01:16.190> then<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> rice

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
make sure it's airtight then so the rice

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.100 
make sure it's airtight then so the rice
is<00:01:18.480> gonna<00:01:18.630> absorb<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> water<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.720> as<00:01:21.720> long<00:01:21.990> as

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
is gonna absorb the water and as long as

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620 
is gonna absorb the water and as long as
it<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.350> dries<00:01:22.620> off<00:01:22.860> completely<00:01:23.370> it<00:01:24.270> should

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it just dries off completely it should

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
it just dries off completely it should
work<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.650> there's<00:01:25.830> no<00:01:25.980> guarantees<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.760> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
work but there's no guarantees with this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.360 
work but there's no guarantees with this
there's<00:01:27.330> no<00:01:27.450> guarantees<00:01:27.960> that'll<00:01:28.260> work<00:01:28.410> so

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
there's no guarantees that'll work so

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.940 
there's no guarantees that'll work so
don't<00:01:29.580> just<00:01:29.820> dump<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:31.410> dump<00:01:31.560> yourself

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
don't just dump your don't dump yourself

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.969 
don't just dump your don't dump yourself
throw<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.160> in<00:01:32.250> water<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.880> test<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
throw it in water just to test it

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.990 
throw it in water just to test it
there's<00:01:34.979> some<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.250> resources<00:01:35.760> out<00:01:35.970> there

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
there's some other resources out there

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.920 
there's some other resources out there
there's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> service<00:01:37.229> club<00:01:37.410> with<00:01:37.700> Liquipel

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
there's a service club with Liquipel

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
there's a service club with Liquipel
it's<00:01:39.930> liquid<00:01:40.260> paddle<00:01:40.650> comm<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.090> send

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's liquid paddle comm you can send

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's liquid paddle comm you can send
them<00:01:42.510> your<00:01:42.630> phone<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.650> spray<00:01:43.979> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
them your phone and they spray this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.740 
them your phone and they spray this
stuff<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.580> it<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:44.970> makes<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:46.310> have<00:01:47.310> water

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
stuff on it which makes it I have water

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
sort of bounce off of it that's not

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.330 
sort of bounce off of it that's not
that's<00:01:51.300> also<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.990> 100%<00:01:52.140> guarantee<00:01:53.040> that's

that's also not 100% guarantee that's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
that's also not 100% guarantee that's
gonna<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.640> safe<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.680> also<00:01:55.800> use<00:01:56.869> silicone

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
gonna be safe you can also use silicone

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
gonna be safe you can also use silicone
packets<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.430> things<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.210> come<00:02:00.420> in

packets is this things that come in
shoeboxes<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.750> electronics<00:02:03.750> boxes<00:02:04.880> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
shoeboxes and electronics boxes so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.460 
shoeboxes and electronics boxes so
basically<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.750> same<00:02:06.960> thing<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.229> with

basically the same thing but with

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.810 
basically the same thing but with
silicone<00:02:07.920> packets<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.490> it's<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.729> gonna

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
silicone packets and it's just gonna

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.310 
silicone packets and it's just gonna
absorb<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.300> water<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.890> dry<00:02:10.890> off<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.070> device
