 young farmers and then becomes 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.009
 very appropriate to have a means of this 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.700
 type because it is an area that there is hardly 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.729
 been given and therefore we want to achieve 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.820

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.369
 coronation can then produce those 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.700
 fruits hoped for in the name of the father of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:51.009

 identified in this machine a 140 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.430
