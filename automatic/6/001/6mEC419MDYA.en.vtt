00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
sculpture and stuff so I would say like

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.160 
sculpture and stuff so I would say like
famous<00:00:31.820> fine<00:00:32.820> artists<00:00:33.239> would<00:00:33.450> probably<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.989> at

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
famous fine artists would probably be at

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.060 
famous fine artists would probably be at
roche<00:00:35.210> at<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.450> moment<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.680> his<00:00:37.860> stuff<00:00:38.040> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
roche at the moment but his stuff so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760 
roche at the moment but his stuff so
expensive<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.120> seems<00:00:39.360> unattainable<00:00:39.770> so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
expensive that it seems unattainable so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
expensive that it seems unattainable so
the<00:00:40.890> person<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> probably<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the person that I think is probably the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
best there's a guy named Tom leduc who's

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.040 
best there's a guy named Tom leduc who's

but<00:00:49.289> also<00:00:49.440> sculpture<00:00:51.320> he<00:00:52.320> uses<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.770> kinds<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but also sculpture he uses all kinds of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
but also sculpture he uses all kinds of
weird<00:00:54.079> um<00:00:55.610> I'll<00:00:56.610> use<00:00:56.789> assuming<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

of the clay but for all intents and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.780 
of the clay but for all intents and
purposes<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> would<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.799> was<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.280> real

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
purposes you would think it was a real

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.969 
purposes you would think it was a real
knife<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.360> yet<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> were<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> touch<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
knife and yet if you were to touch it it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.880 
knife and yet if you were to touch it it
would<00:01:23.189> completely<00:01:23.220> destroy<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.600> um<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
would completely destroy it so um I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
would completely destroy it so um I
think<00:01:26.520> Tom<00:01:26.909> leduc<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> man<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> moment

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
