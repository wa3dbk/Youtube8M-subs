which is the 28 to 75 millimeter F 2.8
no<00:00:47.309> vibration<00:00:47.760> controller<00:00:48.059> ends<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.329> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
have a vibration reduction but it does

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.839

Tamron however I'd be kind of tempted
with<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.639> Tabitha's<00:02:33.030> vibration<00:02:33.510> reduction

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
with the Tabitha's vibration reduction

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.080 
with the Tabitha's vibration reduction
because<00:02:34.409> there's<00:02:34.560> nothing<00:02:34.829> in<00:02:35.340> any<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.909> other

about the current 24 to 70 millimeter

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.199 
lens and then the new one I'm not really
seeing<00:03:22.379> it's<00:03:22.680> having<00:03:23.099> increased<00:03:23.849> vibration

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209

seeing it's having increased vibration
reduction<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.409> or<00:03:25.650> weather<00:03:25.979> seal<00:03:26.310> events

reduction or in or weather seal events

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.759 
reduction or in or weather seal events
at<00:03:26.729> that<00:03:26.879> at<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.120> moment<00:03:27.449> and<00:03:28.169> it's<00:03:28.409> like

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
at that at the moment and it's like

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.490 
at that at the moment and it's like
that's<00:03:28.979> more<00:03:29.189> than<00:03:29.370> double<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:29.879> prices<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.659> lot

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that's more than double the prices a lot

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.879 
that's more than double the prices a lot
more<00:03:31.979> and<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> canon<00:03:34.169> I've<00:03:34.349> just<00:03:34.560> kind<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.769> gone

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
more and so canon I've just kind of gone

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.479 
more and so canon I've just kind of gone
crazy<00:03:35.310> with<00:03:35.819> their<00:03:36.540> price<00:03:37.079> for<00:03:37.560> their<00:03:37.709> new<00:03:37.949> 24

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
crazy with their price for their new 24

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.490 
crazy with their price for their new 24
to<00:03:38.579> 70<00:03:38.909> so<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.329> think<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:40.019> makes<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:40.379> the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
to 70 so I think this makes that the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.890 
to 70 so I think this makes that the
Tamron<00:03:40.859> 1<00:03:41.040> little<00:03:41.609> cheap<00:03:41.909> as<00:03:42.120> chips<00:03:42.150> compared

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
Tamron 1 little cheap as chips compared

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.259 
Tamron 1 little cheap as chips compared
to<00:03:43.079> Canada<00:03:43.500> if<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.799> why<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.159> was<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> Canon<00:03:44.759> well<00:03:45.239> I

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
to Canada if I why it was a Canon well I

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.099

is<00:03:56.009> half<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.939> price<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.989> even<00:03:58.409> that<00:03:58.560> almost

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
is half the price if even that almost

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.429 
is half the price if even that almost
like<00:03:59.009> a<00:03:59.069> third<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.759> price<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:01.349> other

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
like a third of the price the other

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.770 
like a third of the price the other
thing<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:01.979> a<00:04:02.009> full<00:04:02.489> frame<00:04:02.909> lens<00:04:02.939> so<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.569> can

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
thing is is a full frame lens so you can

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
thing is is a full frame lens so you can
stick<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.049> your<00:04:04.139> film<00:04:04.379> cameras<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.009> you<00:04:05.159> can

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
stick on your film cameras and you can

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.339 
stick on your film cameras and you can
also<00:04:05.400> stick<00:04:05.669> on<00:04:05.790> your<00:04:05.909> aps-c<00:04:06.359> sized<00:04:06.930> cameras

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
also stick on your aps-c sized cameras

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.349 
also stick on your aps-c sized cameras
like<00:04:07.469> the<00:04:07.560> d<00:04:07.709> 300<00:04:07.949> or<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.459> you're<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.609> Canon<00:04:09.180> you

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
like the d 300 or if you're a Canon you

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.469 
like the d 300 or if you're a Canon you
can<00:04:09.479> also<00:04:09.599> put<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.019> your<00:04:10.280> d7<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.459> your<00:04:11.699> d5

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
can also put it on your d7 and your d5

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.209 
can also put it on your d7 and your d5
so<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:12.959> can<00:04:13.199> use<00:04:13.469> on<00:04:13.620> any<00:04:13.769> camera<00:04:14.039> that<00:04:14.099> you

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
so you can use on any camera that you

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.439 
so you can use on any camera that you
want<00:04:14.400> it's<00:04:14.699> also<00:04:14.819> going<00:04:14.969> to<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.120> coming<00:04:15.359> out

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
want it's also going to be coming out

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.509 
want it's also going to be coming out
for<00:04:15.599> Sony<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.289> with<00:04:16.469> Sony<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.949> not<00:04:17.190> gonna<00:04:17.340> have

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
for Sony but with Sony is not gonna have

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.099 
for Sony but with Sony is not gonna have
a<00:04:17.549> vibration<00:04:18.000> reduction<00:04:18.329> or<00:04:18.719> vibrate

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
a vibration reduction or vibrate

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.140 
a vibration reduction or vibrate
vibration<00:04:19.650> control<00:04:19.769> in<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.579> actual<00:04:20.909> lanes

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
vibration control in the actual lanes

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.760 
vibration control in the actual lanes
because<00:04:21.329> Sony's<00:04:21.810> cameras<00:04:22.169> have<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
because Sony's cameras have it in the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.620 
because Sony's cameras have it in the
body<00:04:23.099> which<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.120> not<00:04:24.300> actually

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
body which I think it's not actually

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.770 
body which I think it's not actually
quite<00:04:24.810> as<00:04:24.930> good

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
quite as good

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.030 
quite as good
Lynne<00:04:26.110> because<00:04:26.350> every<00:04:26.500> time<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.680> lose<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.950> the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
Lynne because every time you lose to the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.040 
Lynne because every time you lose to the
people<00:04:27.400> there<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.510> pastry<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:28.930> have<00:04:29.020> a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
people there is pastry to have a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.290 
people there is pastry to have a
vibration<00:04:29.740> controlled<00:04:30.490> when<00:04:31.000> you're<00:04:31.090> looking

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
vibration controlled when you're looking

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.520 
vibration controlled when you're looking
through<00:04:31.420> that<00:04:31.540> rather<00:04:32.020> than<00:04:32.139> just<00:04:32.260> one<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
through that rather than just one of you

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.350 
through that rather than just one of you
take<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.740> photo<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.190> they'd<00:04:33.580> be<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:33.970> sensor

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
take the photo and they'd be in a sensor

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.790 
take the photo and they'd be in a sensor
that's<00:04:34.480> moving<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.870> think<00:04:35.230> but<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.440> current

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
that's moving I think but the current

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.290 
that's moving I think but the current
one<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.310> this<00:04:36.460> one<00:04:36.700> is<00:04:36.850> probably<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
one is that this one is probably the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.870 
one is that this one is probably the
smallest<00:04:37.690> lightest<00:04:38.560> most<00:04:38.710> compact<00:04:39.220> versions

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
smallest lightest most compact versions

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.980 
smallest lightest most compact versions
of<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.330> 24<00:04:41.169> is<00:04:41.320> 270<00:04:41.950> ranges<00:04:42.820> lenses<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.780> one

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
of the 24 is 270 ranges lenses this one

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.540 
of the 24 is 270 ranges lenses this one
I<00:04:44.020> think<00:04:44.139> is<00:04:44.350> also<00:04:44.740> gonna<00:04:44.860> be<00:04:44.919> equally<00:04:45.400> as

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
I think is also gonna be equally as

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.030 
I think is also gonna be equally as
compact<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.360> well<00:04:46.600> it's<00:04:47.169> also<00:04:47.350> being<00:04:47.680> towed<00:04:47.919> as

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
compact as well it's also being towed as

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.670 
compact as well it's also being towed as
being<00:04:48.250> pretty<00:04:48.520> much<00:04:48.669> moisture<00:04:49.680> resistant

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
being pretty much moisture resistant

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.140 
being pretty much moisture resistant
which<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:50.919> quite<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.160> good<00:04:51.220> thing<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:52.000> one

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
which is quite a good thing and the one

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.879 
which is quite a good thing and the one
thing<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.480> this<00:04:52.600> new<00:04:52.900> one<00:04:53.080> would<00:04:53.260> have<00:04:53.500> which

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
thing that this new one would have which

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.430 
thing that this new one would have which
the<00:04:54.070> old<00:04:54.250> one<00:04:54.550> does<00:04:54.850> is<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.840> aperture<00:04:56.410> ring

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
the old one does is the aperture ring

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.890 
the old one does is the aperture ring
now<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.070> absurd<00:04:57.520> ring<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.880> find<00:04:58.270> very<00:04:58.510> handy

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
now this absurd ring I find very handy

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.110 
now this absurd ring I find very handy
for<00:04:59.020> whatever<00:04:59.200> I'm<00:04:59.350> doing<00:04:59.650> videos<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.490> if<00:05:00.970> I'm

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
for whatever I'm doing videos and if I'm

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.240 
for whatever I'm doing videos and if I'm
wanting<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.690> move<00:05:02.140> this<00:05:02.290> from<00:05:02.410> my<00:05:02.590> neck<00:05:02.860> on<00:05:03.040> of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
wanting to move this from my neck on of

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.190 
wanting to move this from my neck on of
my<00:05:03.280> Canon<00:05:03.850> camera<00:05:04.150> it's<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.570> very<00:05:04.900> simple

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
my Canon camera it's just a very simple

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.140 
my Canon camera it's just a very simple
adapter<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:05.890> need<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.280> can<00:05:06.730> put<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.000> onto

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
adapter that I need I can put it onto

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150 
adapter that I need I can put it onto
the<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.720> Canon<00:05:08.020> cameras<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:08.560> I've<00:05:08.950> done<00:05:09.070> that

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
the the Canon cameras and I've done that

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.440 
the the Canon cameras and I've done that
quite<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.370> few<00:05:09.430> times<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.970> one<00:05:10.150> thing<00:05:10.300> about

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
quite a few times the one thing about

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.350 
quite a few times the one thing about
this<00:05:10.630> though<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.320> its<00:05:11.770> focus<00:05:12.280> was<00:05:12.880> okay

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
this though is that its focus was okay

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.770 
this though is that its focus was okay
but<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:14.050> zoom<00:05:14.550> what's<00:05:15.550> really<00:05:15.880> sticky<00:05:16.300> you

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
but it's zoom what's really sticky you

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.010 
but it's zoom what's really sticky you
know<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:17.140> never<00:05:17.200> managed<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.890> do<00:05:18.040> a<00:05:18.250> zoom

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
know I never managed to do a zoom

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.630 
know I never managed to do a zoom
smoothly<00:05:20.020> bad<00:05:20.560> with<00:05:20.860> this<00:05:21.010> when<00:05:21.190> it's<00:05:21.370> special

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
smoothly bad with this when it's special

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.350 
smoothly bad with this when it's special
minutes<00:05:21.850> on<00:05:21.970> servers<00:05:22.390> filming<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.729> yeah<00:05:24.760> not

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
minutes on servers filming and yeah not

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.680 
minutes on servers filming and yeah not
gonna<00:05:25.450> work

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
gonna work

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.900 
gonna work
this<00:05:26.260> also<00:05:26.590> had<00:05:26.889> one<00:05:27.070> of<00:05:27.160> its<00:05:27.220> closest

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
this also had one of its closest

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.969 
this also had one of its closest
focusing<00:05:28.630> distances<00:05:29.380> on<00:05:29.500> one<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.740> most

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
focusing distances on one of the most

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.060 
focusing distances on one of the most
highest<00:05:30.250> magnification<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.479> in<00:05:31.690> ours

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
highest magnification so in ours

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.590 
highest magnification so in ours
although<00:05:33.070> was<00:05:33.250> at<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.400> macro<00:05:33.940> lens<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.330> any<00:05:34.510> way

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
although was at a macro lens in any way

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.540 
although was at a macro lens in any way
you<00:05:34.660> could<00:05:34.960> get<00:05:35.140> very<00:05:35.500> very<00:05:36.010> close<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.460> your

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
you could get very very close to your

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.550 
you could get very very close to your
subject<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:37.120> it<00:05:37.240> still<00:05:37.510> get<00:05:37.840> everything<00:05:38.080> in

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
subject and it still get everything in

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.820 
subject and it still get everything in
focus<00:05:38.590> so<00:05:39.930> fingers<00:05:40.930> crossed<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.260> this<00:05:41.560> one

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
focus so fingers crossed that this one

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.430 
focus so fingers crossed that this one
keeps<00:05:42.400> all<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.970> great<00:05:43.270> abilities<00:05:44.020> of<00:05:44.140> base

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
keeps all the great abilities of base

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.640 
keeps all the great abilities of base
which<00:05:44.740> is<00:05:45.010> its<00:05:45.220> small<00:05:45.760> light<00:05:46.570> weight<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.200> close

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
which is its small light weight is close

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.860 
which is its small light weight is close
focusing<00:05:48.220> ability<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.640> optically<00:05:49.330> just<00:05:49.600> very

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
focusing ability and optically just very

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.110 
focusing ability and optically just very
very<00:05:49.990> good<00:05:50.440> this<00:05:51.220> one<00:05:51.430> currently<00:05:51.700> it<00:05:51.940> has<00:05:52.090> a

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
very good this one currently it has a

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.580 
very good this one currently it has a
little<00:05:52.300> bit<00:05:52.360> of<00:05:52.450> a<00:05:52.510> front<00:05:52.780> focus<00:05:53.260> I<00:05:53.320> think<00:05:53.350> know

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
little bit of a front focus I think know

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.409 
little bit of a front focus I think know
a<00:05:53.800> little<00:05:54.100> bit<00:05:54.220> more<00:05:54.280> back<00:05:54.580> focusing<00:05:55.180> at

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
a little bit more back focusing at

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.120 
a little bit more back focusing at
whatever<00:05:55.660> I'm<00:05:55.840> doing<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.110> longer<00:05:56.620> distance

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
whatever I'm doing the longer distance

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.620 
whatever I'm doing the longer distance
stuff<00:05:57.370> so<00:05:57.850> I'd<00:05:58.000> like<00:05:58.090> seems<00:05:58.360> I've<00:05:58.479> got<00:05:58.600> a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
stuff so I'd like seems I've got a

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.969 
stuff so I'd like seems I've got a
little<00:05:58.720> bit<00:05:58.870> more<00:05:59.080> kind<00:05:59.320> of<00:05:59.380> quality<00:05:59.710> control

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
little bit more kind of quality control

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.270 
little bit more kind of quality control
on<00:06:00.100> that<00:06:00.160> one<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.640> but<00:06:01.300> I'm<00:06:01.570> thinking<00:06:02.289> if<00:06:02.500> this

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
on that one and but I'm thinking if this

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.420 
on that one and but I'm thinking if this
is<00:06:03.460> imposed<00:06:03.910> and<00:06:04.300> it's<00:06:04.930> not<00:06:05.080> like<00:06:05.289> 1200<00:06:06.160> pounds

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
is imposed and it's not like 1200 pounds

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.400 
is imposed and it's not like 1200 pounds
if<00:06:06.520> it's<00:06:06.669> lit<00:06:06.850> read<00:06:07.000> about<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.300> 700<00:06:08.050> pounds<00:06:08.320> or

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
if it's lit read about the 700 pounds or

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.700 
if it's lit read about the 700 pounds or
something<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:09.270> think<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.390> is<00:06:10.539> a<00:06:10.720> absolutely

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
something I think that is a absolutely

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.250 
something I think that is a absolutely
top<00:06:12.190> top<00:06:12.880> lens<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:13.360> go<00:06:13.479> for<00:06:13.720> its<00:06:13.900> spatial

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
top top lens to go for its spatial

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.409 
top top lens to go for its spatial
feuding<00:06:14.560> video<00:06:14.979> stuff<00:06:15.340> as<00:06:15.490> well<00:06:15.700> having<00:06:16.360> a

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
feuding video stuff as well having a

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.779 
feuding video stuff as well having a
vibration<00:06:16.990> control<00:06:17.130> 24<00:06:18.130> millimeter<00:06:18.640> lens<00:06:19.260> hmm

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
vibration control 24 millimeter lens hmm

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.840 
vibration control 24 millimeter lens hmm
really<00:06:21.789> kind<00:06:22.300> of<00:06:22.360> excites<00:06:22.720> me<00:06:22.930> quite<00:06:23.410> a<00:06:23.440> bit<00:06:23.850> so

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
really kind of excites me quite a bit so

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.490 
really kind of excites me quite a bit so
I<00:06:25.090> think<00:06:25.650> for<00:06:26.650> videos<00:06:27.220> on<00:06:27.760> the<00:06:28.330> canon<00:06:28.870> 5d<00:06:29.260> mark

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
I think for videos on the canon 5d mark

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.930 
I think for videos on the canon 5d mark
ii<00:06:29.770> i<00:06:30.250> think<00:06:30.940> that<00:06:31.830> would<00:06:32.830> just<00:06:33.039> be<00:06:33.160> so<00:06:33.490> handy

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
ii i think that would just be so handy

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.890 
ii i think that would just be so handy
for<00:06:34.120> so<00:06:34.419> many<00:06:34.599> things<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:36.479> okay<00:06:37.479> the<00:06:37.720> canon

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
for so many things and okay the canon

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.140 
for so many things and okay the canon
own<00:06:39.230> brand<00:06:39.680> and<00:06:40.040> the<00:06:40.100> nikon<00:06:40.460> own<00:06:40.639> brands<00:06:40.910> may

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
own brand and the nikon own brands may

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.170 
own brand and the nikon own brands may
be<00:06:41.260> optically<00:06:42.260> tiny<00:06:42.800> bit<00:06:43.010> better<00:06:43.220> but<00:06:43.760> as<00:06:43.850> some

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
be optically tiny bit better but as some

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.670 
be optically tiny bit better but as some
other<00:06:44.419> photographers<00:06:44.930> on<00:06:45.050> the<00:06:45.080> internet<00:06:45.440> say

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
other photographers on the internet say

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.740 
other photographers on the internet say
you<00:06:45.800> know<00:06:45.919> stop<00:06:46.220> being<00:06:46.580> so<00:06:46.850> analytical<00:06:47.360> stop

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
you know stop being so analytical stop

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.170 
you know stop being so analytical stop
pixel<00:06:48.169> peeping<00:06:48.500> blah<00:06:48.740> blah<00:06:48.889> blah<00:06:49.280> again<00:06:50.150> I

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
pixel peeping blah blah blah again I

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.030 
pixel peeping blah blah blah again I
think<00:06:50.540> with<00:06:50.630> lenses<00:06:50.990> you<00:06:51.169> really<00:06:51.560> do<00:06:51.710> need<00:06:51.919> to

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
think with lenses you really do need to

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.010 
think with lenses you really do need to
pixel<00:06:52.400> peep<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.760> really<00:06:53.210> be<00:06:53.360> analytical<00:06:53.960> of

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
pixel peep and really be analytical of

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.600 
pixel peep and really be analytical of
everything<00:06:54.470> that<00:06:54.560> you<00:06:54.680> see<00:06:54.889> coming<00:06:55.310> over<00:06:55.460> the

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
everything that you see coming over the

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.250 
everything that you see coming over the
camera<00:06:55.850> manufacturers<00:06:56.479> you<00:06:56.600> guys<00:06:56.750> all<00:06:56.960> the

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
camera manufacturers you guys all the

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.800 
camera manufacturers you guys all the
tests<00:06:57.530> that<00:06:57.650> they're<00:06:57.860> done<00:06:58.180> beforehand<00:06:59.180> so

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
tests that they're done beforehand so

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.510 
tests that they're done beforehand so
again<00:07:00.320> I<00:07:00.410> say<00:07:00.560> don't<00:07:00.800> buy<00:07:00.949> this<00:07:01.010> straight<00:07:01.490> away

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
again I say don't buy this straight away

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.010 
again I say don't buy this straight away
wait<00:07:01.940> until<00:07:02.210> there's<00:07:02.389> been<00:07:02.510> hundreds<00:07:02.930> of

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
wait until there's been hundreds of

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.480 
wait until there's been hundreds of
tests<00:07:03.380> I've<00:07:03.530> been<00:07:03.650> done<00:07:03.830> on<00:07:03.949> it<00:07:03.979> it's<00:07:04.190> a<00:07:04.280> lots

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
tests I've been done on it it's a lots

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.760 
tests I've been done on it it's a lots

of different websites and forums but do

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.400 
of different websites and forums but do
remember<00:07:07.220> that<00:07:07.370> this<00:07:07.990> it's<00:07:08.990> got<00:07:09.169> feature

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
remember that this it's got feature

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.500 
remember that this it's got feature
which<00:07:09.650> none<00:07:10.010> of<00:07:10.250> other<00:07:10.460> competitors<00:07:11.060> have<00:07:11.240> and

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
as a vibration reduction of vibration

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.379 
as a vibration reduction of vibration
control<00:07:14.000> in<00:07:14.720> a<00:07:15.260> very<00:07:15.530> small<00:07:15.860> body<00:07:16.210> it's<00:07:17.210> quite

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
control in a very small body it's quite

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.409 
control in a very small body it's quite
good<00:07:17.419> good<00:07:18.350> thing<00:07:18.530> to<00:07:18.650> have<00:07:18.910> is<00:07:19.910> it<00:07:20.180> worse

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419 
good good thing to have is it worse
