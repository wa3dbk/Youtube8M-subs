00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:09.569
 good this video is to show the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.569
 brand television 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.120
 32 l 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.240
 m 6.200 what is 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:28.520
 at this moment one is perhaps the only thing 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:33.070
 32 inch smrtv 3d TV in 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.070
 theory this television has 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.170
 full east features 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.929
 has also 13 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.860
 convert from 12 to 13 s smrtv and have 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:50.380
 connection lan 3 hdmi 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.300
 and they can also be controlled by a 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.960
 through a smartphone now also 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.190
 has wifi whale which means that it 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.920
 can connect you through a 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.390
 connector adapter to stop the wifi 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.500
 good more feature there is on the internet 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.190
 I'm going to show 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.190
 they contain 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.930
 the TV when you buy it in 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.710
 Chile 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.830
 already 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.830
 Y 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.850
 the television had 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.990
 and before 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.460
 of three of the two should know that the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.750
 technology to get in 3d is so 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 passive which means that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 the glasses 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.930
 They are very simple and do not need batteries 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.290
 another part are very light indeed 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.360
 that are very very light really is 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 They are very cute comes 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.520
 the lenses in each box 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.340
 They come included two boxes of lenses are 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 quite light highlights above all 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.590
 with compared to technology lenses and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.660
 where weight is noticeable especially 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.660
 good batteries is to say that this month 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.180
 it also includes 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.140
 with the remote control 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 a plastic that serves to obtain the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.840
 cables 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.080
 a component adapter an adapter 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.580
 Of video 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.580
 on my power cord 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.200
 children 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.140
 and those of the control and also include some 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.630
 supports for when putting the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.110
 TV on a wall mount 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.490
 so what 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.490
 so, something is ready outside 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.000
 good guarantees 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.520
 m 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.200
 here we have the support one of the parties 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.200
 of television support 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.760
 that while plastic construction 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.990
 solid 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.260
 it shows that there is a 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.950
 I'm going to work with him 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.950
 but good 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 we find 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.420
 tractors 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.890
 the television stand on a black 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:58.569
 bright comes with a plastic sheet 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.609
 electoral and we will say it in case 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.920
 it has a fault and you carry things 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.920
 plastic on a metal support 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.590
 probably of resistant aluminum with 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.590
 a rubber band to avoid forgetting 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 the television 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.900
 In the back 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.120
 to TV connectivity is a 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.480
 port to remove a port 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.409
 for the computer and receives sheep a 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:30.219
 fear and computer audio 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:32.080
 input connectors what's important in 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.210
 a cable connector a connector 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.880
 optical unit 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.840
 these are connected through those of the 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.900
 components that we just saw the river 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.460
 and here we have the kings 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.460
 and the usb king 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.720
 here they are sure they are going they are going to 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.720
 connect the evening wifi 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:02.030
 the time to buy them as it comes 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.030
 included you have to buy 6 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:14.889
 since I already have the screen where is 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.309
 the specifications the 3d cinema is 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.309
 Martin 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.969
 comes with the digital standard and also the 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.279
 info on the energy efficiency that 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.789
 for me it is very important with a consumption 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:36.370
 of 0 902 good is the first part 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.759
 then we will see the TV at 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.759
 functioning
