remember 400 to find out where all the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.430 
remember 400 to find out where all the
lines<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.220> carb<00:00:05.549> goes<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.290> bought<00:00:07.290> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
lines of this carb goes to I bought the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.850 
lines of this carb goes to I bought the
scrambler<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.340> used<00:00:09.090> so<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.599> don't<00:00:09.900> know<00:00:10.740> if

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
scrambler and used so I don't know if

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.280 
scrambler and used so I don't know if
everything's<00:00:11.219> correct<00:00:11.460> I'm<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.150> ran<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.750> I'm

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
everything's correct I'm it ran so I'm

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.820 
everything's correct I'm it ran so I'm
really<00:00:13.679> pretty<00:00:14.400> sure<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.759> correct<00:00:14.929> but<00:00:15.929> if

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
really pretty sure it's correct but if

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
really pretty sure it's correct but if
we're<00:00:17.039> looking<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.940> left<00:00:18.150> side<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
we're looking at the left side of the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.650 
we're looking at the left side of the
vehicle<00:00:19.170> right<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:20.310> looks<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
vehicle right here looks to be like the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.210 
vehicle right here looks to be like the
gas<00:00:21.900> line<00:00:23.150> um

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
gas line um

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.890 
gas line um
it's<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.580> yet<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> fuel

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's that one right yet it's got a fuel

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.590 
it's that one right yet it's got a fuel
filter<00:00:28.080> right<00:00:28.439> there<00:00:28.760> it<00:00:29.760> runs<00:00:30.800> all<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.130> way

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
filter right there it runs all the way

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:42.830 
filter right there it runs all the way
and<00:00:33.600> choo<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:37.579> fuel<00:00:39.260> petcock<00:00:41.719> into<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and choo the fuel petcock into the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350 
and choo the fuel petcock into the
middle<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
middle there that one right there and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.590 
middle there that one right there and
sure<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> left<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.329> but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
sure you can see it not the left one but

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.950 
sure you can see it not the left one but
middle<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.760> that's<00:00:50.760> where<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.660> goes

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
middle one so that's where just one goes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.740 
middle one so that's where just one goes
to<00:00:52.309> an<00:00:53.309> overflow<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.059> connects<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.539> here

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
to an overflow that connects right here

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
to an overflow that connects right here
it's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> smaller<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.920> goes<00:00:56.250> straight

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it's a smaller one it just goes straight

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.510 
it's a smaller one it just goes straight
down

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
down

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.990 
down
mmm<00:00:59.579> let's<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:01.350> else<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.829> else<00:01:02.000> this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
mmm let's see what else what else this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.109 
mmm let's see what else what else this
is<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.510> choke<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> throttle<00:01:05.360> yeah<00:01:08.119> here's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
is just a choke and throttle yeah here's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.710 
is just a choke and throttle yeah here's
one<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.750> bottom<00:01:10.220> very<00:01:11.220> bottom<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.510> just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
one on the bottom very bottom it just

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
one on the bottom very bottom it just
goes<00:01:13.010> down<00:01:14.689> there<00:01:15.689> looks<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> fuel

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
goes down there looks like it has a fuel

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.330 
goes down there looks like it has a fuel
valve<00:01:18.020> some<00:01:19.020> sorts<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> no<00:01:19.680> water<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.130> creep

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
valve some sorts of no water can creep

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
valve some sorts of no water can creep
up<00:01:22.640> that's<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.299> seeing<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:29.570> now<00:01:30.570> see

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
up that's all I'm seeing really now see

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.980 
up that's all I'm seeing really now see
much<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> anything<00:01:31.590> else<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
much of anything else this one for the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
much of anything else this one for the
gas<00:01:34.229> line<00:01:34.560> over<00:01:35.460> her<00:01:36.240> uh<00:01:37.070> some<00:01:38.070> sort<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:40.490> hose

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
gas line over her uh some sort of hose

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.319 
gas line over her uh some sort of hose
for<00:01:41.909> something<00:01:42.619> breather<00:01:43.619> hose<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.220> guess<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
for something breather hose I guess this

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.440 
for something breather hose I guess this
is<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> overflow<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.909> don't<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.180> anything

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
is the overflow I don't see anything

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
is the overflow I don't see anything
else<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.600> should<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:52.049> pretty<00:01:52.200> much<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.759> um

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
else so it should be pretty much it um

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
else so it should be pretty much it um
yeah<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.380> tell<00:01:55.590> me<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.920> covered<00:01:56.460> everything

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
yeah so tell me if I covered everything

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
yeah so tell me if I covered everything
here<00:01:59.240> see<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.600> hose<00:02:00.840> goes<00:02:01.200> from<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> gas

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
here see this hose goes from the gas

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.900 
here see this hose goes from the gas
tank<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.649> petcock<00:02:05.659> or<00:02:06.659> fuel<00:02:06.899> valve<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
tank to the petcock or fuel valve and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.690 
tank to the petcock or fuel valve and
that's<00:02:08.910> pretty<00:02:09.300> much<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:11.190> two<00:02:11.340> three

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that's pretty much it just one two three

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.500 
that's pretty much it just one two three
one<00:02:12.690> two<00:02:13.110> three<00:02:13.580> smaller<00:02:14.580> ones<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.090> think<00:02:15.150> our

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
one two three smaller ones I think our

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.630 
one two three smaller ones I think our
eighth<00:02:15.720> inch<00:02:16.019> hose<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:18.239> bigger<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:19.640> are

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
eighth inch hose and the bigger one are

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.050 
eighth inch hose and the bigger one are
three<00:02:20.940> eighths<00:02:21.120> maybe<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.550> yeah<00:02:23.819> let<00:02:24.030> me

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
three eighths maybe but so yeah let me

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
three eighths maybe but so yeah let me
know<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.360> cover<00:02:24.540> everything<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.230> if

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
know if I cover everything for you if

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.209 
know if I cover everything for you if
you<00:02:25.739> have<00:02:26.519> any<00:02:26.700> other<00:02:26.849> questions
