00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I was not alone and um it was just it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.229 
I was not alone and um it was just it
was<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.590> time<00:00:32.040> he<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.520> front<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.940> us<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
was just time he was in front of us and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.209 
was just time he was in front of us and
it<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.690> time<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> perform<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:35.190> our

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
it was just time to perform and do our

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.590 
it was just time to perform and do our
best<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.000> didn't<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.300> best

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
best because if we didn't do our best

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080 
best because if we didn't do our best
then<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.280> chance<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.820> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
then you know it was our one chance so I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.540 
then you know it was our one chance so I
think<00:00:39.690> somehow<00:00:40.260> my<00:00:40.620> body<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.280> can't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
think somehow my body was like you can't

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
think somehow my body was like you can't
you<00:00:41.670> can't<00:00:41.910> mess<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.320> right<00:00:43.530> what

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you can't mess up it's all right what

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.700 
you can't mess up it's all right what
yeah<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.570> decide<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
yeah just what if they decide that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.760 
yeah just what if they decide that
instead<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.629> they<00:00:48.629> still<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> concert

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
instead and they still have the concert

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.270 
instead and they still have the concert
as<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> tribute<00:00:50.309> where<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.780> still<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
as a tribute where they still want you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
as a tribute where they still want you
to<00:00:53.430> dance<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.840> probably<00:00:55.140> just

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
to dance and these they probably just

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
to dance and these they probably just
have<00:00:55.590> special<00:00:56.250> guests<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> sing<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.090> songs

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
they spend so much time effort and sweat

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
they spend so much time effort and sweat
into<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.780> project<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> can't<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.010> be

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
into that project that it can't just be

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.149 
into that project that it can't just be
like<00:01:11.460> okay<00:01:11.610> no<00:01:11.939> concert<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.619> did

like okay no concert that like they did

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.010 
like okay no concert that like they did
there<00:01:14.850> certainly<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.540> something<00:01:15.780> about

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there certainly will do something about

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
there certainly will do something about
it<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.880> know<00:01:17.970> they're
