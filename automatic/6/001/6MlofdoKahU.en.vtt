00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 samsung galaxy s 4g i'll give you a tip there 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.410
 It will get very basic for you, but 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.859
 It's very cool, what I'm going to pass on. 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.820
 you are for example have here look or 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 the icons I have here nelson and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.630
 stepped on the certainty the ids does not arrive its ix 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080
 huh 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.260
 I have battery mourning order manager 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 programs and location services sound 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 it blocks the wifi display next to you 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:49.640
 get it all because you do not have it here 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:49.640
 like you did it but it's the staff 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.899
 for example he showed you the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.480
 that every one does the battery campaign goes 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.059
 there in the settings there and enter 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 battery that as you can see by 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:15.900
 example of another de tite manager 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:21.830
 of applications but how did you do it? 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:27.590
 as a shortcut and you have to get 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:31.049
 applications here and have a fondness for 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.740
 hidden that same affection that the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.770
 shortcut to configure what you do if 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 well you click on it and release it is that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 do you want 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 here he will open the shortcut to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.710
 configure omissions 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.759
 so you will choose what you want 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.890
 a good example data viewer bpn wifi 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.960
 Let's choose one here, for example. 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.570
 client can choose notifications 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.570
 even modifications come on 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.659
 notifications 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.430
 it every action you make the phone and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.730
 have notifications there then this is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.850
 a personal form of yours 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.580
 for example you are here configuration 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.590
 here is an example to trigger the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.750
 wifi network you come here the lady goes 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.080
 Talk, do not need to come here alone. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.440
 click here 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.710
 the alloy does not have much benefit of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.290
 person is more advantage to win well 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.320
 here I fell but if you want for example 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.240
 have the icon there you neither visual 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:51.370
 example has an advantage because it has 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:56.710
 applications here down here in 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.500
 display device settings 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.400
 How much work do you have to do? 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.950
 this is not it 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.950

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.840
 one more step here he is a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.800
 little faster this piece this 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.560
 process 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.410
 You're the manager here, for example, I still 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.390
 I'm not in the application manager on 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.200
 How much do you have to do if? 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.750
 for covered normal method applications 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.070
 settings receive more and manager 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.780
 applications because you have the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.820

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.060
