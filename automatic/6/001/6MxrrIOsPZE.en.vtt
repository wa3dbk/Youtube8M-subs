00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.700
 hi how are you today I bring a 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.160
 new video is a cool day to do 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.009
 a bed for your kittens which is 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.719
 pretty easy to make fast the best 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.940
 everything is that there is no need to sew 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.250
 so they will be able to do it without any 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.350
 problem and their cats of course les 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.539
 will love it so I hope that this 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.310
 idea like them as always if they have 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.289
 Any question or comment 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.320
 leave it at the bottom and good 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.810
 Well, let's start with this tutorial 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.450
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.590
 one yard of blanket type wool fabric 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.540
 fiber for polyester filling scissors 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.870
 scoreboard or a hit to mark the canvas 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.710
 ruler or tape measure and finally tape 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.710
 or adhesive tape 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.310
 to begin I'm going to fold the fabric to the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.020
 half and then I'm going to cut this what 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.000
 I do so I can finish like this with two 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.000
 pieces of cloth that are the same size 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.860
 once they have the two pieces of 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.140
 cut fabric I'm going to line them over 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.790
 the one on the other to be able to cut 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.790
 the two fabrics at the same time 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.070
 then I will leave a space of 4 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.080
 inches and I'm going to make a margin 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.290
 around the blanket using the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.290
 tape 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.810
 since they have finished doing the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.640
 margin with the tape they will realize 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.060
 that a small square remains in the corners 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.700
 marked which if you left a 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.399
 4 inches space must measure 4 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.110
 inches x 4 inches so the only thing 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.310
 what we're going to do now is cut this 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.310
 picture very carefully 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.620
 I'm going to start on one of the sides and go 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.720
 to cut strips one inch wide 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.030
 If you prefer you can help with a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.900
 rule and mark the fabric to make it more 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.900
 easy to cut 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.840
 let's do the same in the others 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.580
 sides and so the blanket will keep us 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.580
 with a kind of bangs around 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.170
 well now I'm going to start tying the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.550
 strips above with the ones below 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.550
 as they are aligned 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.239
 It is very important to double knot and 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.069
 that if they make a single knot like me what 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.170
 I was doing the blanket at the beginning 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.849
 it will not stay strong enough 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.849
 to hold the stuffing 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.170
 since we have three of the sides 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.330
 moored then let's start 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.870
 Fill the bed with fiber 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.580
 polyester for stuffing and if you guys 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.660
 prefer they can use the filling of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.660
 some pillow that they have 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.400
 good and finally only we have left 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.319
 finish tying the last side that 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.209
 we are left and as I said before 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.209
 It is important to double knot 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 try to make the knots a little 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.250
 tight so that the filling does not go 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.780
 to leave and also remember not to pull too 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.079
 hard so that the fabric does not go to 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.079
 to break 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.849
 once they finish tying all 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.010
 the knots that's how the bed is 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.230
 now finally we can only see if a 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.450
 mumbai likes it 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.909
 so this is the day just like 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.799
 I share how to make a bed for your 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.980
 data which is very very easy to do 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.280
 in fact my cat loved the bed 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.260
 she is happy and I plan to make her 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.879
 a new one so I hope that this idea 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.069
 you may like them and that you 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.019
 can help a lot remember how 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.640
 always if they have any questions or 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.530
 some comment of twins in the part 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.420
 below and well, we see each other very 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.420
 soon in the next video thanks
