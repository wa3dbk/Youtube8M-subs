00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.130
 from a few years to now we have seen a 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.780
 series of evolutions in computers 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.270
 such as video cards and 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.000
 processors became very powerful 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.910
 to make sure everything works 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.570
 adequate power supply 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.199
 the variety of products has evolved 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.010
 in the market is great but one stands out 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.489
 it is the color ceará x 1501 of the models 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.639
 more powerful than this source 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.100
 offers 1500 watts and is certified 

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:46.339
 titanium and this means that it can 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.299
 work more efficiently than 94 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.299
 percent 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.200
 the first thing we notice 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.810
 for this source is its size it is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.560
 huge and brings an incredible number of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.080
 connecting cables in addition to many cables 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.180
 are long and this makes sense since 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.479
 nobody will put such a source in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.110
 a small cabinet this source is not only 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 big, it's really heavy too. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.899
 justify when we pay attention to its 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.020
 the number of components of the 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.240
 quality is great and this happens through 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.300
 numerous protection systems and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.690
 included in the project 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.390
 Speaking of which the color will ceará x 1500 and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.920
 has protection against 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.580
 overheating short overload 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.140
 circuit and current peaks 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.140
 if she encounters any of these problems 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.580
 it automatically disarms by avoiding 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.560
 damage to it and to the computer 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.099
 this source has a single line 12 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
 volts but it is able to deliver up to 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.459
 125 perez 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.310
 that is more than enough to 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.580
 feed your video cards to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.580
 Complete it carries the 80plus titanium seal 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.739
 the highest in the category 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.900
 this means that it almost 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.420
 waste energy by working with 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.420
 more than 94 percent 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.910
 who likes to follow the operation 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.000
 machine will be interested 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.580
 by corser link through this software 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.300
 you can manage some features of the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.860
 source 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.650
 besides monitoring the energy consumption 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.620
 and the output voltages 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.100
 software is good but has 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.420
 problems at first installation it does not 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.340
 detected the source 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.910
 only after repeating the process 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.220
 worked correctly to certify the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.440
 efficiency of this source we realize 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.380
 some tests with the help of a 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.470
 meter we measure the main voltages 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.360
 in two moments with the machine idle and 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.090
 with it at full load 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.460
 the results showed that almost no 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.450
 there was fluctuation which shows the quality 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.450
 from this source 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.720
 to measure energy efficiency 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.800
 we used a watt meter 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.800
 see what the result was 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.500
 corsair has earned a place of 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.690
 highlight among manufacturers of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.090
 of energy by creating products with 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.320
 quality and reliability 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.270
 the interior of the 1501 example that 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.190
 company engineers 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.370
 enough in the design of the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.110
 components of this source 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.880
 just see how everything is set up for 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.120
 realize this 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.220
 The only real problem with this source is you 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.019
 find a good excuse to put 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.500
 her inside your machine 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.680
 after all there are 1500 watts and few 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.550
 people will need it all there 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.010
 outside this source can be found by 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.530
 $ 450 the price is slightly above 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.960
 from other sources with the same power 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.479
 nevertheless the uncontested quality 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.240
 of this model makes it a 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.040
 Great buy 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.510
 check also the analysis note that world 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.510
 and until our next video
