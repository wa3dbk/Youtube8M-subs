00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
the short time that I was there I

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.490 
the short time that I was there I
learned<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:29.660> take<00:03:29.840> advantage<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.380> my

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
learned to take advantage of my

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.740 
learned to take advantage of my
mid-range<00:03:30.890> game<00:03:31.130> more<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.460> to<00:03:32.030> not<00:03:32.210> focus<00:03:32.450> so

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
mid-range game more and to not focus so

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.090 
mid-range game more and to not focus so
much<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:33.050> attacking<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.560> rim

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
much on attacking the rim

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.800 
much on attacking the rim
you<00:03:34.580> know<00:03:34.670> those<00:03:34.850> who<00:03:34.970> euro<00:03:35.240> guys<00:03:35.510> play

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
you know those who euro guys play

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.090 
you know those who euro guys play
different<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.290> they<00:03:36.380> certainly<00:03:36.650> have<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.920> lot

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
different and they certainly have a lot

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.710 
different and they certainly have a lot
to<00:03:37.220> offer<00:03:39.610> more<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.850> half-court<00:03:41.420> maybe<00:03:41.630> a

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
to offer more of a a half-court maybe a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720 
to offer more of a a half-court maybe a
team<00:03:42.020> style<00:03:42.320> game<00:03:42.710> I<00:03:42.920> mean<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.220> guess<00:03:43.460> did<00:03:43.640> you

team style game I mean I guess did you

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.970 
team style game I mean I guess did you
get<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.000> same<00:03:44.240> approach<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.840> guess<00:03:44.980> watching

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
get that same approach I guess watching

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.220 
get that same approach I guess watching
them<00:03:46.100> play<00:03:46.220> yeah<00:03:46.730> no<00:03:47.420> question<00:03:47.600> they<00:03:48.020> play<00:03:48.200> a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
them play yeah no question they play a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.710 
them play yeah no question they play a
different<00:03:48.410> style<00:03:48.740> you<00:03:49.640> know<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.420> whole<00:03:50.570> time

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
different style you know the whole time

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.060 
different style you know the whole time
I<00:03:50.780> was<00:03:50.930> there<00:03:51.140> all<00:03:51.350> they<00:03:51.500> kept<00:03:51.680> telling<00:03:51.860> me

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
I was there all they kept telling me

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.070 
I was there all they kept telling me
though<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.490> you<00:03:52.700> Americans<00:03:53.300> are<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:53.480> selfish

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
though you you Americans are so selfish

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.500 
though you you Americans are so selfish
and<00:03:54.230> fall<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:55.550> true<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.000> know<00:03:56.090> in<00:03:56.300> some

and fall and it's true you know in some

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.000 
and fall and it's true you know in some
sense<00:03:56.540> not<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:56.960> it's<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.260> bad<00:03:57.410> thing<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:57.860> it's

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
sense not that it's a bad thing but it's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.470 
sense not that it's a bad thing but it's
certainly<00:03:58.580> different<00:03:58.880> in<00:03:59.120> it

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
certainly different in it

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.070 
certainly different in it

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
mindset they don't run isolation they

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.080 
mindset they don't run isolation they
don't<00:04:05.420> like<00:04:05.510> guys<00:04:05.630> hold<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:05.990> ball

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090

don't like guys hold the ball
we<00:04:08.510> ask<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.720> question<00:04:09.350> that's<00:04:09.800> really<00:04:10.010> random

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
we ask a question that's really random

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.970 
we ask a question that's really random
but<00:04:10.550> that<00:04:11.480> dunk<00:04:12.170> contest<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.740> you<00:04:12.830> almost

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
but that dunk contest that you almost

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.430 
but that dunk contest that you almost
got<00:04:13.220> yourself<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.820> had<00:04:13.970> your<00:04:14.120> little<00:04:14.440> your

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
got yourself in you had your little your

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.320 
got yourself in you had your little your
marketing<00:04:15.920> campaign<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.370> stuff<00:04:16.700> I<00:04:17.120> think

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
marketing campaign and stuff I think

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.370 
marketing campaign and stuff I think
that<00:04:17.450> could<00:04:17.570> have<00:04:17.660> changed<00:04:17.810> their<00:04:18.019> career<00:04:18.260> at

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
that could have changed their career at

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.470 
that could have changed their career at
all<00:04:18.470> if<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.680> had<00:04:18.860> made<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.100> into<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:20.440> I'm<00:04:22.480> sure

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
all if you had made it into it I'm sure

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.970 
all if you had made it into it I'm sure
things<00:04:24.020> would<00:04:24.200> be<00:04:24.290> different<00:04:24.500> about<00:04:24.710> I've

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
things would be different about I've

things would be different about I've
been<00:04:25.010> in<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.370> it's<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:26.570> know<00:04:26.690> subtle<00:04:27.170> ways<00:04:27.380> but

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860
