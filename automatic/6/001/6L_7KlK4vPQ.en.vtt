hi<00:00:00.930> again<00:00:01.079> in<00:00:01.380> our<00:00:01.530> last<00:00:01.740> video<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.790> talked

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi again in our last video we talked

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.910 
hi again in our last video we talked
about<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.449> ease<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.629> use<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.170> MF<00:00:04.500> series

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
about the ease of use of the MF series

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.340 
about the ease of use of the MF series
in<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.850> video<00:00:06.029> I'd<00:00:06.299> like<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.540> talk<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
in this video I'd like to talk about the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.070 
in this video I'd like to talk about the
efficiency<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.460> MF<00:00:08.820> E<00:00:08.940> series<00:00:09.510> which<00:00:09.900> can

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
efficiency of the MF E series which can

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.140 
efficiency of the MF E series which can
save<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> user<00:00:10.620> 20<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.219> 30<00:00:11.429> percent<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:12.030> their

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
save the user 20 to 30 percent on their

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.789 
save the user 20 to 30 percent on their
fuel<00:00:12.450> consumption<00:00:13.049> versus<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> conventional

design the E Series is 20 to 30 percent

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.120 
design the E Series is 20 to 30 percent
more<00:00:24.570> efficient<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.439> uses<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> three

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
more efficient because it uses a three

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.300
