 the base a super simple recipe so in 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.210
 big someone who tells you no but the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.769
 faults years too complicated to do they

 the fart and you grilled it thanks to 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.619
 water world case that's it i did 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.450
 we'll be able to start 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.399
 at first you have heated 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 milk in which you will be pouring 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:17.920
 sugar and vanilla sugar sachet or 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:20.049
 a vanilla pod while your 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.630
 the sweet vanilla is cooking 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.939
 you will break your 2 separate them 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.810
 yellow whites break the kernel put 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:31.990
 the bazaar fuck the dawa in a big 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.119
 container you go to his calves 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 whites and you'll put the yellows 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.320
 in a smaller container when you 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.260
 have separate white and yellow you put 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.390
 the whites aside 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.370
 pavle who is out of the field as say 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.050
 the professionals the milk that I am 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.720
 heating and very very 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.040
 little sweet in the authentic recipes of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.200
 the floating island or at least in the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.410
 most I think we sugar not alone and there 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.350
 I do not sugar a quarter of the sugar of 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.990
 March is most of the sugar I pour it 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.370
 in the egg yolks and that's what 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.320
 I advise you to do 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.500
 and when you poured suck 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.360
 yellow order and well you go 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.320
 whisk until the mixture 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.790
 hand laundering and 1005 drummer at 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.860
 the old as dany so if you have 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.160
 someone who smokes at sydec you for the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.610
 make 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.780
 do not hesitate to make sure that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.410
 knock this step 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.800
 simply because what is it 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.420
 but you have to go through nothing big 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.100
 can not be obtained easily 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.100
 what we get we get a beautiful 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.330
 nuisance cream and you deserved it 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.080
 when you carried your milk to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.739
 boiling 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.350
 you will pour it into your young people 's 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.540
 to bleach little by little and coming back 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.220
 constantly and if you have proceeded 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.310
 like me you will realize 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.930
 that actually your container for them 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.660
 yellow is way too small for 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:12.430
 welcome your milk so you're gonna 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:14.290
 change containers here do not forget 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.040
 not the little manipulation that is not well 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.110
 because it is cold 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.670
 not because it is at least 35 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.390
 degrees in the kitchen not everything 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.740
 simply 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.090
 if like me you did not take a 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.760
 pan handles well you're going 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.760
 burn that's like a novel I'm 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:40.470
 it was planned I'm sure it happens 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.470
 also to philippe etchebest 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.989
 be sure to stop cooking 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.760
 your mix just before having or as soon as 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.680
 the first little bubbles 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.440
 boiling do not need your 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.760
 butt mix otherwise the yolk will cook and 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.300
 you're going to have pieces of omelette 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.390
 in this cream will now have to 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.580
 cool be really very very cold 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.680
 to ride your floating island 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.570
 you can largely prepared this 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.400
 cream the day before and put it in the fridge 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.910
 to really be fine 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.970
 cold 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.740
 I usually add a little 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:34.479
 lichette of rome in my custard 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:47.440
 rum women and lager 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:50.460
 in blue and the colonel's health we're going 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.460
 finish under the table 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.300
 Normally we must have a lot of sweetness 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.900
 you actually make a meringue with them 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.729
 whisked egg whites 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.169
 I'm not a crunch 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.840
 whites simply because I'm going 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.880
 add a caramel plus cream 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.139
 English who is herself is already 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.710
 sweet enough 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.419
 we're going to overdose sugar like 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.379
 Lisa and Bart in the episode where they go 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:17.289
 in London I add to the two spoons 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:27.819
 coffee sugar in my white and gimont 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:30.069
 snow weather that's how I do it 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.289
 I actually use two misses to do in 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.370
 stainless steel you can use a ladle 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.319
 you can use any 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.750
 small container that in this form or not 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.270
 and I actually do to little dome who 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.719
 will get fat and slightly caramelize 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.240
 in the oven you plunge your mouth your 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:51.129
 two miss towards your ramekins what 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.259
 you actually want in your whites in 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.259
 snow and you and go into the hole 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.000
 that's it you know my recipe for 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740
 the floating island do not hesitate to 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.370
 send me photos of your version 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.710

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.900
 that's it for all who evans match is 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.450
 in my opinion it's not tomorrow the year that 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.900
 I could create a non-instagram account 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.030
 the more we stay on twitter and facebook 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.400

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.520
 to taste 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:16.200
 it would have been perfect with a little bit of 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:21.690
 rum after very soon 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.770
 ciao it's nice to know that it 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.090
 exist 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.340
 even if it's not every day 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.650
 like Santa Claus floating tags 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.030
 also it's feasible it's not like 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.330
 to go to the moon 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.810
 it feels like two who devours 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:40.620
 an entire island entirely populated with 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:43.070
 dead drunk pirate will be the good he is that 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.070
