00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
global Offensive was updated today and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.099 
global Offensive was updated today and
valve<00:00:10.070> nerfed<00:00:11.599> the<00:00:12.599> OP<00:00:14.420> unfortunately<00:00:15.420> right

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
valve nerfed the OP unfortunately right

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.790 
valve nerfed the OP unfortunately right
now<00:00:16.379> people<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.609> moving<00:00:18.060> very<00:00:18.090> slowly<00:00:18.840> while

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
now people are moving very slowly while

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.240 
now people are moving very slowly while
zoomed<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.880> while<00:00:21.420> scoped<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.160> OP

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
zoomed in while scoped in with the OP

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.060 
zoomed in while scoped in with the OP
and<00:00:24.560> I<00:00:27.529> think<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.849> horrible<00:00:30.570> thing<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.380> be

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and I think it's a horrible thing to be

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.810 
and I think it's a horrible thing to be
honest<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.350> makes<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> weapon<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
honest because it makes the weapon so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
honest because it makes the weapon so
much<00:00:36.059> less<00:00:36.329> powerful<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.200> mean<00:00:38.129> some<00:00:38.340> people

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
much less powerful I mean some people

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.010 
much less powerful I mean some people
were<00:00:39.300> complaining<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.020> op<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.219> strong

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
were complaining that op is very strong

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.290 
were complaining that op is very strong
but<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.829> opinion<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.579> definitely

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
but in my opinion it definitely

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.560 
but in my opinion it definitely
shouldn't<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.960> been<00:00:46.170> nerfed<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.570> for

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
shouldn't have been nerfed and for

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.299 
shouldn't have been nerfed and for
example<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> play<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.739> position

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
example I like to play this position

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.729 
example I like to play this position
while<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.090> while<00:00:51.420> I'm<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> city<00:00:52.079> side<00:00:52.379> on

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
while on while I'm on the city side on

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
while on while I'm on the city side on
destitute<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.840> usually

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
destitute and what I like to do usually

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
destitute and what I like to do usually
is<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.309> early<00:00:56.520> peak<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.690> here

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
is just go for an early peak right here

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
is just go for an early peak right here
and<00:00:58.520> if<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.699> don't<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.030> anyone<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.570> just

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and if I don't see anyone there I just

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.820 
and if I don't see anyone there I just
back<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.890> jiggle<00:01:02.219> peak<00:01:02.449> like<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
back off and the jiggle peak like this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.670 
back off and the jiggle peak like this
but<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.140> can't<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.650> that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
but right now I can't really do that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.300 
but right now I can't really do that
because<00:01:08.960> moving<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> OP<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.830> scoped

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
because moving with the OP well scoped

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
because moving with the OP well scoped
in<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.860> fucking<00:01:14.400> useless<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.119> very

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
in it's pretty fucking useless it's very

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
in it's pretty fucking useless it's very
slow<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> should<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.939> doing<00:01:17.970> right

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
slow and what I should be doing right

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.620 
slow and what I should be doing right
now<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.810> probably<00:01:19.200> something<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.630> peak

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
now is probably something like this peak

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.270 
now is probably something like this peak
and<00:01:22.159> sculpt<00:01:23.210> afterwards<00:01:26.900> flick<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.170> mean<00:01:28.470> whirl

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and sculpt afterwards flick I mean whirl

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.289 
and sculpt afterwards flick I mean whirl
once<00:01:29.670> said<00:01:29.970> stop<00:01:30.570> skull<00:01:31.530> flick<00:01:31.979> shoot<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.850> guess

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
once said stop skull flick shoot I guess

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.380 
once said stop skull flick shoot I guess
and<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:34.350> rule<00:01:34.650> applies<00:01:35.189> perfectly<00:01:35.729> right

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and this rule applies perfectly right

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.620 
and this rule applies perfectly right
now<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> current<00:01:38.280> op<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:41.210> what<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.299> crazy

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
now to the current op and what is crazy

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.179 
now to the current op and what is crazy
is<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:44.869> honestly<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.409> dust<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
is that honestly this out of dust to a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.600 
is that honestly this out of dust to a
lot<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.460> cities<00:01:47.909> peak<00:01:48.899> middle<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> start

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
lot of cities peak middle at the start

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
lot of cities peak middle at the start
of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> round<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.860> they

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
of the round and what they do is they

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.749 
of the round and what they do is they
scope<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.479> move<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.759> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
scope in and then move out like that to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.149 
scope in and then move out like that to
catch<00:01:56.909> some<00:01:57.299> terrorist<00:01:58.229> speaking<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.890> try<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
catch some terrorist speaking and try to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.090 
catch some terrorist speaking and try to
pick<00:01:59.369> them<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:01.829> can't

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
pick them off but right now they can't

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.260 
pick them off but right now they can't
really<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:04.939> that's<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.060> because

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
really do that and that's just because

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
really do that and that's just because
you're<00:02:06.540> moving<00:02:06.869> very<00:02:06.899> slow<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> old<00:02:07.770> by

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you're moving very slow with the old by

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.520 
you're moving very slow with the old by
the<00:02:08.729> time<00:02:09.030> you're<00:02:09.239> by<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.720> time<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.289> be

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the time you're by this time you will be

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.190 
the time you're by this time you will be
terrorists<00:02:11.459> who<00:02:11.550> already<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.660> they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
terrorists who already see you and they

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.589 
terrorists who already see you and they
they<00:02:13.680> will<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.980> able<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.370> kill<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.760> faster

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
they will be able to kill you faster

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.380 
they will be able to kill you faster
than<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.260> them<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:17.060> there's<00:02:18.060> something

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
than you see them and there's something

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.040 
than you see them and there's something
a<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:19.080> crazy<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:20.519> mid<00:02:20.970> peak<00:02:21.330> has

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
a little crazy because this mid peak has

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.930 
a little crazy because this mid peak has
been<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> part<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.800> counter-strike<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.790> so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
been a part of counter-strike for so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.710 
been a part of counter-strike for so
many<00:02:24.060> years<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.780> by<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.769> all<00:02:26.129> up<00:02:26.400> nerve<00:02:26.720> they

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
many years and by this all up nerve they

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960 
many years and by this all up nerve they
pretty<00:02:27.930> much<00:02:28.080> eliminated<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.129> mean<00:02:29.340> T's<00:02:29.700> can

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
pretty much eliminated it I mean T's can

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.600 
pretty much eliminated it I mean T's can
still<00:02:30.239> peak<00:02:30.569> but<00:02:30.989> c4<00:02:31.650> CDs<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.160> extremely

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
still peak but c4 CDs it's extremely

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.120 
still peak but c4 CDs it's extremely
cold<00:02:32.819> it's<00:02:33.180> pretty<00:02:33.450> much<00:02:33.540> useless<00:02:34.130> what

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
cold it's pretty much useless what

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.460 
cold it's pretty much useless what
people<00:02:35.400> should<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.819> right<00:02:35.970> now<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.690> peek<00:02:36.930> mid

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
people should do right now to peek mid

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.640 
people should do right now to peek mid
on<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:37.980> too<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.660> first<00:02:39.660> peak<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.170> only<00:02:40.410> then

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
on this too is first peak and only then

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.970 
on this too is first peak and only then
scope<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:43.440> probably<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
scope and that's that's probably not the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.509 
scope and that's that's probably not the
best<00:02:44.010> tactic<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.890> there's<00:02:46.890> no<00:02:47.099> alternative

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
best tactic and there's no alternative

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.740 
best tactic and there's no alternative
to<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.209> right<00:02:48.450> now

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
to it right now

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.199

if you want to be committed you have to
peek<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.840> mean<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.349> have<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:53.010> scoped<00:02:53.880> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
peek I mean you have to be scoped and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.420 
peek I mean you have to be scoped and
wait<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> Corsair<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.739> mean<00:02:55.890> wait<00:02:56.099> for<00:02:56.310> the

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
instantly you'd have to wait like a half

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.330 
instantly you'd have to wait like a half
a<00:03:00.420> second<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:00.870> something<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.799> only<00:03:02.069> then<00:03:02.220> you

most likely they will kill you because

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.809 
most likely they will kill you because
they<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.200> advantage<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.950> pretty

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
they will have the advantage and pretty

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.210 
they will have the advantage and pretty
much<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.150> same<00:03:15.360> thing<00:03:15.690> goes<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:15.989> t<00:03:16.590> side<00:03:16.860> cash

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
much the same thing goes to t side cash

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.410 
much the same thing goes to t side cash
and<00:03:17.700> T<00:03:17.910> side<00:03:18.209> barrage<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.609> have<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.850> peek<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
and T side barrage you have to peek and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
and T side barrage you have to peek and
scope<00:03:22.380> afterwards<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.459> think<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.900> isn't<00:03:25.109> stupid

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
scope afterwards I think it isn't stupid

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.849 
scope afterwards I think it isn't stupid
but<00:03:25.859> it's<00:03:26.760> somewhat<00:03:27.150> strange<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.959> I'm<00:03:28.650> not

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859
