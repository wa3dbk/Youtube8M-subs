00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.840 
of this week's chapter which didn't
really<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.100> part<00:03:03.310> too<00:03:03.430> much<00:03:03.700> because

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
really like that part too much because

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.789 
really like that part too much because
we<00:03:04.570> don't<00:03:04.750> even<00:03:04.840> know<00:03:05.019> who<00:03:05.170> did<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.440> or<00:03:05.709> how

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
we don't even know who did it or how

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.890 
we don't even know who did it or how
they<00:03:06.250> did<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.790> man<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.060> would<00:03:07.480> have<00:03:07.630> liked

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
they did it so a man I would have liked

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.319 
they did it so a man I would have liked
to<00:03:08.079> see<00:03:08.290> as<00:03:08.950> far<00:03:09.100> as<00:03:09.220> who<00:03:09.400> rupiah<00:03:09.760> was<00:03:09.940> fighting

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
to see as far as who rupiah was fighting

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.360 
to see as far as who rupiah was fighting
and<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.930> know<00:03:11.049> how<00:03:11.380> they<00:03:11.530> took<00:03:11.709> her<00:03:11.859> down<00:03:12.010> but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
and you know how they took her down but

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.250 
and you know how they took her down but
then<00:03:12.549> necessarily<00:03:13.540> make<00:03:13.660> any<00:03:13.840> sense<00:03:14.049> for

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
then necessarily make any sense for

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.729 
then necessarily make any sense for
whatever<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.880> know<00:03:16.000> Ichigo<00:03:16.739> definitely

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
whatever but you know Ichigo definitely

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.319 
whatever but you know Ichigo definitely
you<00:03:17.980> know<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.130> could<00:03:18.549> see<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.880> happening

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
you know I could see this happening

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.509 
you know I could see this happening
where<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.569> know<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.440> lot<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.709> cabins<00:03:21.100> get<00:03:21.220> taken

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
where you know a lot of cabins get taken

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.099 
where you know a lot of cabins get taken
down<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.819> looks<00:03:22.060> as<00:03:22.209> though<00:03:22.329> soil<00:03:22.720> signs<00:03:22.930> left

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
down and looks as though soil signs left

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.210 
down and looks as though soil signs left
the<00:03:23.200> fall<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.560> think<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:23.799> said<00:03:23.980> in<00:03:24.069> some

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the fall and I think I said in some

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.610 
the fall and I think I said in some
other<00:03:24.340> videos<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.970> then<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.109> Royal<00:03:26.350> Guard

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
other videos and then the Royal Guard

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.550 
other videos and then the Royal Guard
steps<00:03:27.040> down<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.579> maybe<00:03:27.819> on<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:29.019> Royal<00:03:29.350> Guard

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
steps down and maybe on the Royal Guard

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.520 
steps down and maybe on the Royal Guard
we<00:03:29.859> also<00:03:30.010> saw<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.430> weekend<00:03:31.109> kampachi<00:03:32.109> going

we also saw this weekend kampachi going

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.650 
we also saw this weekend kampachi going
nutso<00:03:32.889> maybe<00:03:33.069> kampachi<00:03:33.519> maybe<00:03:34.120> some<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
nutso maybe kampachi maybe some of the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.050 
nutso maybe kampachi maybe some of the
visors<00:03:35.079> are<00:03:35.470> able<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.130> hold<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.549> some<00:03:36.819> type<00:03:37.030> of

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
visors are able to hold up some type of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.750 
visors are able to hold up some type of
resistance<00:03:37.870> we're<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:38.920> chic<00:03:39.250> eyes<00:03:39.430> or

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
resistance we're just like chic eyes or

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.490 
resistance we're just like chic eyes or
something<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.239> since<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.170> know<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
something like that since you know the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.530 
something like that since you know the
Royal<00:03:41.709> Guard<00:03:41.920> members<00:03:42.220> likely<00:03:42.609> are<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.359> know

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
Royal Guard members likely are you know

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.780 
Royal Guard members likely are you know
high<00:03:43.959> level<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:44.590> far<00:03:44.829> as<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.670> they<00:03:45.760> are

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
high level as far as this is they are

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.309 
high level as far as this is they are
captains<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.810> know<00:03:46.900> they're<00:03:47.139> probably

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
captains and you know they're probably

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.370 
captains and you know they're probably
stronger<00:03:47.620> than

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
stronger than

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.530 
stronger than
who<00:03:48.830> knows<00:03:48.980> there<00:03:49.130> she<00:03:49.340> cosme<00:03:49.730> be<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.060> lot

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
who knows there she cosme be a lot

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.120 
who knows there she cosme be a lot
stronger<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.290> maybe<00:03:51.470> they<00:03:51.620> did<00:03:51.770> haul<00:03:51.950> some

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
stronger so maybe they did haul some

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.600 
stronger so maybe they did haul some
kind<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.280> resistance<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.940> drive<00:03:53.570> out<00:03:53.840> the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
kind of resistance to drive out the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.830 
kind of resistance to drive out the
abandoned<00:03:55.610> right<00:03:55.790> not<00:03:56.000> only<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.300> but<00:03:56.360> we<00:03:56.660> all

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
abandoned right not only that but we all

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.560 
abandoned right not only that but we all
know<00:03:57.050> that<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.940> abandoned<00:03:58.940> right<00:03:59.060> member<00:03:59.420> is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
know that the abandoned right member is

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.850 
know that the abandoned right member is
they<00:03:59.720> all<00:03:59.900> happen<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.440> guess<00:04:00.680> they've

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
they all happen I guess they've

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.190 
they all happen I guess they've
researched<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.520> captains<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.210> they<00:04:02.750> know<00:04:02.960> a

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
researched the captains and they know a

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.480 
researched the captains and they know a
lot<00:04:03.230> of<00:04:03.350> different<00:04:03.440> information<00:04:03.800> about<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.340> lot

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
lot of different information about a lot

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.000 
lot of different information about a lot
of<00:04:04.520> them<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.050> definitely<00:04:06.050> they<00:04:06.530> probably

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
of them so definitely they probably

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.440 
of them so definitely they probably
don't<00:04:07.190> know<00:04:07.400> anything<00:04:07.700> about<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.150> rural

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
don't know anything about the rural

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.760 
don't know anything about the rural
guards<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:08.900> they<00:04:09.020> probably<00:04:09.290> will<00:04:09.500> probably

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
guards so they probably will probably

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.290 
guards so they probably will probably
catch<00:04:09.920> them<00:04:10.100> by<00:04:10.190> surprise<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.700> i<00:04:10.760> could<00:04:10.940> see

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300
