the<00:00:31.890> beyblade<00:00:32.700> spin<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> noticeable

the beyblade spin there's a noticeable

the beyblade spin there's a noticeable
deeper<00:00:35.340> gradient<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:35.910> keeps<00:00:36.149> the

deeper gradient which keeps the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
deeper gradient which keeps the
beyblades<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:37.200> centered<00:00:37.649> than<00:00:37.950> the

stadium

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.190 

now<00:01:04.850> you've<00:01:05.000> seen<00:01:05.210> how<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.540> stadium<00:01:05.930> effects

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
now you've seen how this stadium effects

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.130 
now you've seen how this stadium effects
beyblade<00:01:06.650> let's<00:01:07.220> see<00:01:07.400> how<00:01:07.490> they<00:01:07.700> bow<00:01:13.540> as<00:01:14.540> you

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
beyblade let's see how they bow as you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.590 
beyblade let's see how they bow as you
can<00:01:15.260> see<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.619> gradient<00:01:16.040> makes<00:01:16.280> difference

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:02:06.290 

only<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.630> small<00:01:20.900> difference<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.920> makes<00:01:22.130> one

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.050 

there<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.510> difference
