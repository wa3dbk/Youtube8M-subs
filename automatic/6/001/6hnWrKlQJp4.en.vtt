okay<00:00:02.129> so<00:00:02.190> what<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.669> have<00:00:02.700> here<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.710> dell

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:05.629 
okay so what we have here is a dell

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.250 
okay so what we have here is a dell
inspiron<00:00:07.400> 6000<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:09.360> what<00:00:09.570> happens<00:00:10.019> with

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
inspiron 6000 and what happens with

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.220 
inspiron 6000 and what happens with
these<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.920> they<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.759> your<00:00:11.940> standard<00:00:12.599> Foxconn

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
these is they have your standard Foxconn

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.890 
these is they have your standard Foxconn
jack<00:00:13.759> with<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> being<00:00:15.179> said<00:00:15.269> that's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.670> round

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
jack with that being said that's a round

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.410 
jack with that being said that's a round
then<00:00:18.900> center<00:00:19.830> pin<00:00:20.160> configuration<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
then center pin configuration on this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.070 
then center pin configuration on this

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.160 
jack
pretty<00:00:22.710> common<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.340> dell<00:00:23.670> machines<00:00:24.119> even<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
pretty common for dell machines even the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.189 
pretty common for dell machines even the
newer<00:00:25.350> systems<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.099> them<00:00:26.840> but<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:28.050> we're

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
newer systems have them but what we're

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.560 
newer systems have them but what we're
looking<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.760> machine<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.359> brought

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
looking at is this machine was brought

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.139 
looking at is this machine was brought
to<00:00:30.779> us<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> would<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.590> power<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.149> would

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
to us and it would not power on would

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
to us and it would not power on would
not<00:00:33.329> charge<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.809> battery<00:00:34.200> would<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.890> turn<00:00:35.070> on

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
not charge the battery would not turn on

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.160 
not charge the battery would not turn on
period<00:00:35.600> no<00:00:36.600> matter<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.200> did<00:00:38.780> we<00:00:39.780> try<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
period no matter what you did we try to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.610 
period no matter what you did we try to
check<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.590> battery<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> battery<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.850> still

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
check the battery the battery was still

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.420 
check the battery the battery was still
good<00:00:44.360> checked<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> jack<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.379> roaming<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> out

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
good checked the jack for roaming it out

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.389 
good checked the jack for roaming it out
the<00:00:48.059> jack<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.539> perfectly<00:00:48.960> fine<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:50.129> what

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the jack was perfectly fine but what

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.119 
the jack was perfectly fine but what
we're<00:00:50.550> finding<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.590> with<00:00:52.590> many<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.010> these

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
we're finding as with many of these

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
we're finding as with many of these
machines<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.420> typical<00:00:55.379> situation

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
machines it was a a typical situation

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.670 
machines it was a a typical situation
with<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:57.530> previous<00:00:58.579> c6<00:00:59.579> hundreds<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.680> some

of the 51 50s and 50 111 50s

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
of the 51 50s and 50 111 50s
you<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.020> stress<00:01:07.530> fractures<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.430> now

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you would have stress fractures here now

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.260 
you would have stress fractures here now
this<00:01:09.119> camera<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.810> cannot<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.590> as

you're<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:21.290> stress<00:01:22.290> fractures<00:01:22.830> as

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you're going to get stress fractures as

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.060 
you're going to get stress fractures as
you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> developer<00:01:24.299> cron<00:01:24.540> here

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
you can see the developer cron here

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
you can see the developer cron here
that's<00:01:26.070> actual<00:01:26.900> cracking<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.970> board<00:01:30.020> but

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that's actual cracking of the board but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
that's actual cracking of the board but
that<00:01:31.259> doesn't<00:01:31.860> seem<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> largest

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that doesn't seem to be the largest

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
that doesn't seem to be the largest
issue<00:01:34.250> largest<00:01:35.250> issue<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:37.340> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
issue largest issue with this is the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.649 
issue largest issue with this is the
actual<00:01:39.799> inductor<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.229> these<00:01:43.250> actually

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
actual inductor here so these actually

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
actual inductor here so these actually
acted<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.840> fuses<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.829> instead<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> putting

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
acted as fuses so instead of putting

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.389 
acted as fuses so instead of putting
fuses<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> Toshiba's<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:50.159> put

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
fuses like on the Toshiba's they put

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
fuses like on the Toshiba's they put
inductors<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> power<00:01:51.780> cores<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
inductors here for the power cores and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.170 
inductors here for the power cores and
they<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:53.759> acted<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.810> fuses<00:01:55.759> very<00:01:56.759> common

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
they actually acted as fuses very common

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
they actually acted as fuses very common
thing<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:59.070> inductors<00:02:00.030> crack<00:02:00.570> on

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
thing is that these inductors crack on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
thing is that these inductors crack on
the<00:02:01.380> board<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> crack<00:02:02.549> here

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the board so we have a crack here

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.469 
the board so we have a crack here
hairline<00:02:03.390> fracture<00:02:04.399> have<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.610> resolder<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
hairline fracture have to resolder that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.050 
hairline fracture have to resolder that
and<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.740> happens<00:02:08.280> due<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.410> jack<00:02:11.060> working

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and that happens due to the jack working

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.330 
and that happens due to the jack working
its<00:02:12.209> way<00:02:12.390> out<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.290> jack<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.650> actually

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
its way out so this jack is actually

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.610 
its way out so this jack is actually
if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> board<00:02:16.080> sitting<00:02:16.380> here

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
if you have the board sitting here

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.750 
if you have the board sitting here
facing<00:02:17.000> forward<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.209> straight<00:02:19.170> line<00:02:19.760> can

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
facing forward a straight line can

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.370 
facing forward a straight line can
actually<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> jack<00:02:21.989> should<00:02:22.260> have

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
actually see that the jack should have

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.479 
actually see that the jack should have
been<00:02:22.530> straight<00:02:22.890> here

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
been straight here

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.180 
been straight here
but<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.599> crooked<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.440> what's<00:02:25.680> happened<00:02:26.099> is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
but it's crooked so what's happened is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.809 
but it's crooked so what's happened is
it<00:02:26.400> tilted<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.680> hit<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.099> flex<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
it tilted this way and hit and flex the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.040 
it tilted this way and hit and flex the
inductor<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> caused<00:02:31.319> issues<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.540> what<00:02:33.900> we'll

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
inductor and caused issues so what we'll

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.860 
inductor and caused issues so what we'll
do<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.400> test<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.580> jack<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.480> second

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
do is test this jack here in a second

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.650 
do is test this jack here in a second
we'll<00:02:37.140> show<00:02:37.380> how<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.640> test<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.120> make<00:02:39.510> sure

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
we'll show how you can test it make sure

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.650 
we'll show how you can test it make sure
everything<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.170> good<00:02:40.380> with<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:41.660> continuity

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
everything is good with a continuity

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.229 
everything is good with a continuity
tester<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.400> then<00:02:44.400> we'll<00:02:44.819> go<00:02:45.000> from<00:02:45.030> there

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
tester and then we'll go from there

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.509 
tester and then we'll go from there
so<00:02:48.239> now<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.810> our<00:02:49.100> continuity<00:02:50.100> tester

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
so now we have our continuity tester

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.670 
so now we have our continuity tester
hooked<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> ground<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
hooked up you have to ground it to the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.240 
hooked up you have to ground it to the
board<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> grounded<00:02:55.170> here<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:56.100> have

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
board so we have a grounded here we have

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.120 
board so we have a grounded here we have
power<00:02:56.670> coming<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:58.860> good

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
power coming in and we know it's good

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.039 
power coming in and we know it's good
because<00:02:59.670> we<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.180> test<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.630> jack<00:03:01.670> right<00:03:02.670> there

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
because we can test the jack right there

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.199 
because we can test the jack right there
and<00:03:04.049> we<00:03:04.170> get<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.650> light<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.890> turn<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:08.209> if

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
and we get the light to turn on so if

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.199 
and we get the light to turn on so if
the<00:03:09.420> light<00:03:09.599> turns<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:10.080> here<00:03:10.700> we<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
the light turns on here we know that the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.449 
the light turns on here we know that the
power<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.540> good<00:03:12.720> across<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.019> board<00:03:13.230> or<00:03:13.739> at

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
power is good across the board or at

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.240 
power is good across the board or at
least<00:03:14.670> coming<00:03:14.880> into<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.330> jack

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
least coming into the jack

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.910 
least coming into the jack
now<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.549> take<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.660> try<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.989> hook<00:03:19.769> it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
now we can take this and try to hook it

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.069 
now we can take this and try to hook it
up<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.070> say<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.030> one<00:03:21.209> over<00:03:21.420> here<00:03:21.600> by<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.840> power

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
up to say the one over here by the power

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.979 
up to say the one over here by the power
cycle<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.780> get<00:03:24.959> nothing<00:03:26.630> we<00:03:27.630> don't<00:03:27.810> get<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
cycle and we get nothing we don't get a

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.289 
cycle and we get nothing we don't get a
single<00:03:28.230> thing<00:03:29.060> but<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.079> try<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.319> test<00:03:31.680> this

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
single thing but we can try to test this

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.220 
single thing but we can try to test this
and<00:03:33.299> we<00:03:33.420> get<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:36.989> right

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and we get it here but now this right

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.809 
and we get it here but now this right
here<00:03:37.500> because<00:03:37.680> we're<00:03:38.040> pushing<00:03:38.250> down<00:03:38.549> on<00:03:38.579> it

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
here because we're pushing down on it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.229 
here because we're pushing down on it
we're<00:03:39.540> actually<00:03:39.690> getting<00:03:40.049> its<00:03:40.290> start<00:03:40.620> here

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
we're actually getting its start here

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.879 
we're actually getting its start here
but<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.660> don't<00:03:42.780> get<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.139> past<00:03:43.350> there<00:03:44.180> nothing

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
but you don't get it past there nothing

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.220 
but you don't get it past there nothing
so<00:03:46.889> we<00:03:47.040> know<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.579> solder<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:49.079> has

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
so we know that the solder is what has

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.120 
so we know that the solder is what has
caused<00:03:49.530> our<00:03:50.000> actual<00:03:51.000> failure<00:03:51.810> because<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:52.950> can

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
caused our actual failure because we can

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.660 
caused our actual failure because we can
place<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.519> at<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.760> bottom<00:03:54.120> part<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
place this at the bottom part of the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.840 
place this at the bottom part of the
inductor<00:03:56.670> where<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.900> separation<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.730> we

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
inductor where the separation is and we

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.210 
inductor where the separation is and we
get<00:04:00.060> nothing<00:04:00.450> but<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.739> put<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
get nothing but you can put it on the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.360 
get nothing but you can put it on the
top<00:04:02.459> side<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.989> we<00:04:04.139> just<00:04:04.350> laid<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.769> top<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
top side see we just laid on top of the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.990 
top side see we just laid on top of the
inductor<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.060> roll<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.139> across<00:04:07.639> we<00:04:08.639> know<00:04:08.790> that

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
inductor and roll it across we know that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.970 
inductor and roll it across we know that
it<00:04:09.150> goes<00:04:09.329> across<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:10.019> inductor<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.829> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it goes across the inductor so the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.610 
it goes across the inductor so the
inductor<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.430> nothing<00:04:11.850> more<00:04:12.060> than<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.620> coil

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
inductor is nothing more than a coil

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.449 
inductor is nothing more than a coil
that<00:04:13.980> operates<00:04:14.880> at<00:04:15.090> certain<00:04:15.420> frequency

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
that operates at certain frequency

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.370 
that operates at certain frequency
yah-yah-yah<00:04:17.459> -<00:04:17.660> that's<00:04:18.660> roundabout<00:04:19.169> way<00:04:19.350> of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
yah-yah-yah - that's roundabout way of

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.760 
yah-yah-yah - that's roundabout way of
saying<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:20.160> they<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.489> use<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:20.850> as<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.090> fuse

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
saying that they can use this as a fuse

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.240 
saying that they can use this as a fuse
so<00:04:22.880> we're<00:04:23.880> having<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.530> light<00:04:25.530> up<00:04:25.740> as<00:04:25.950> it<00:04:26.099> goes

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
so we're having this light up as it goes

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.189 
so we're having this light up as it goes
across<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.000> inductor

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
across the inductor

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.379 
across the inductor
and<00:04:29.199> we<00:04:29.350> know<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.590> that's<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.280> bad<00:04:30.820> part<00:04:31.150> and

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
and we know that that's the bad part and

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.050 
and we know that that's the bad part and
that's<00:04:31.630> what<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:32.080> have<00:04:32.860> tested<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.460> found<00:04:33.730> so

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
that's what we have tested and found so

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.270 
that's what we have tested and found so
now<00:04:34.210> we're<00:04:34.480> going<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.870> solder<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.949> go<00:04:36.100> from

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
now we're going to solder it and go from

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.120 
now we're going to solder it and go from
there<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:39.460> now<00:04:39.610> we<00:04:39.669> have<00:04:39.970> our<00:04:40.120> board<00:04:40.449> here<00:04:40.690> and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
there so now we have our board here and

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.110 
there so now we have our board here and
I<00:04:42.150> can't<00:04:43.150> really<00:04:43.330> tell<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:44.460> we<00:04:45.460> soldered<00:04:45.880> both

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
I can't really tell but we soldered both

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.010 
I can't really tell but we soldered both
sides<00:04:46.449> of<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.870> inductor<00:04:47.740> back<00:04:48.070> in<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.930> we

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
sides of that inductor back in and we

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.780 
sides of that inductor back in and we
have<00:04:50.169> it<00:04:50.290> hooked<00:04:50.410> up<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.680> power<00:04:50.979> so<00:04:51.280> let's<00:04:51.430> just

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
have it hooked up to power so let's just

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.100 
have it hooked up to power so let's just
see<00:04:51.970> what<00:04:52.120> happens<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.660> let's<00:04:52.690> see<00:04:52.930> if<00:04:52.990> it

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
see what happens so let's see if it

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:02.330 
see what happens so let's see if it
turns<00:04:53.320> on<00:04:56.820> got<00:04:57.820> it<00:04:58.169> powered<00:04:59.169> on<00:04:59.350> and<00:05:00.540> we'll

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
turns on got it powered on and we'll

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.790 
turns on got it powered on and we'll
push<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.550> tank<00:05:04.000> up<00:05:04.450> there<00:05:04.720> goes<00:05:05.260> those<00:05:05.530> green

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
push the tank up there goes those green

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.719 
push the tank up there goes those green
lights<00:05:07.260> in<00:05:08.260> this<00:05:08.380> series<00:05:08.740> one<00:05:08.950> two<00:05:09.160> three<00:05:09.550> like

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
lights in this series one two three like

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.930 
lights in this series one two three like
that<00:05:10.060> turn<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.169> on<00:05:11.350> they<00:05:11.530> turn<00:05:11.590> off<00:05:11.979> but<00:05:12.669> we<00:05:12.760> got

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
that turn it on they turn off but we got

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.430 
that turn it on they turn off but we got
green<00:05:13.180> light<00:05:13.389> over<00:05:13.690> there<00:05:13.840> we<00:05:14.050> got<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.229> green

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
green light over there we got a green

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.800 
green light over there we got a green
light<00:05:14.650> on<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.830> board<00:05:15.130> here<00:05:15.490> just<00:05:16.389> for<00:05:16.570> test

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
light on the board here just for test

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.750 
light on the board here just for test
purposes<00:05:17.380> that<00:05:17.620> means<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:18.040> works<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.550> we'll

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
purposes that means it works so we'll

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.990 
purposes that means it works so we'll
say<00:05:18.970> it's<00:05:19.150> done<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.650> fix<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.340> we<00:05:21.760> just

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
say it's done so to fix that we just

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.810 
say it's done so to fix that we just
hooked<00:05:22.180> up<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.570> in<00:05:23.160> inductor<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.280> fixed<00:05:24.700> it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
hooked up that in inductor and fixed it

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.570 
hooked up that in inductor and fixed it
as<00:05:25.720> precautionary<00:05:26.470> measure<00:05:26.800> we<00:05:27.100> actually

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
as precautionary measure we actually

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.400 
as precautionary measure we actually
soldered<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.180> jack<00:05:28.419> back<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.080> make<00:05:29.229> sure

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
soldered the jack back in and make sure

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.980 
soldered the jack back in and make sure
everything<00:05:29.740> was<00:05:29.889> good<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.510> we're<00:05:31.510> good<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.810> go

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
everything was good and we're good to go

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.659 
everything was good and we're good to go
we'll<00:05:32.229> put<00:05:32.440> this<00:05:32.560> back<00:05:32.770> together<00:05:32.979> and<00:05:33.370> call<00:05:33.550> it

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
we'll put this back together and call it

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.120 
we'll put this back together and call it
fixed
