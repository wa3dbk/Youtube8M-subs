at the largest numbers we're going to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660 
at the largest numbers we're going to
look<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.180> nines<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.890> six<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> B

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
look at these nines and the six and B

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.819 
look at these nines and the six and B
and<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.050> those<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> be

and we know that all of those have to be

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.360 
and we know that all of those have to be
highlighted<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.920> they

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
highlighted because of this because they

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
highlighted because of this because they
are<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.550> highest<00:00:51.090> number<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.809> our<00:00:52.350> size<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
are the highest number in our size a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
are the highest number in our size a
puzzle<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.270> notice<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.469> are

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
really is just to help make the picture

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.130 
really is just to help make the picture
more<00:01:01.260> clear<00:01:02.539> we're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> start<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
more clear we're going to start with the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.070 
more clear we're going to start with the
next<00:01:04.409> number<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.030> five<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.630> five

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
next number which is one in five or five

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
next number which is one in five or five
and<00:01:07.560> we're<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> start<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:08.850> first

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and we're going to start down here first

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
and we're going to start down here first
this<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.260> five<00:01:10.470> says<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this one in five says we have one and we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
this one in five says we have one and we
have<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.360> blank<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.260> five

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
have one or more blank and then five

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.190 
have one or more blank and then five
more<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.270> only<00:01:15.299> six<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
more but because there are only six here

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.890 
more but because there are only six here
we<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.009> know<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.790> five<00:01:18.150> must<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
we actually know that these five must be

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.289 
we actually know that these five must be
the<00:01:19.110> correct<00:01:19.350> solution<00:01:20.090> we're<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the correct solution we're going to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
the correct solution we're going to
start<00:01:21.479> with<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> next<00:01:21.960> 5<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> 5<00:01:22.860> here

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
start with the next 5 and the 5 here

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.210 
start with the next 5 and the 5 here
says<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.780> could<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
says that it could be these two and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.070 
says that it could be these two and
notice<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.820> highlights<00:01:27.270> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
notice that that highlights but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
notice that that highlights but
unfortunately<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.820> as

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
unfortunately it could be this one as

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
unfortunately it could be this one as
well<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> because<00:01:31.350> there<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:31.860> options

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
well and because there are two options

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.039 
well and because there are two options
and<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> correct

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and we don't know which one is correct

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
and we don't know which one is correct
we're<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> only<00:01:35.070> highlight<00:01:35.729> those

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
we're going to only highlight those

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
we're going to only highlight those
squares<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.320> are<00:01:37.530> absolutely

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
squares that we know are absolutely

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
squares that we know are absolutely
correct<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.659> next<00:01:39.930> number<00:01:40.049> we're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
correct the next number we're going to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
correct the next number we're going to
go<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> our<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.340> next<00:01:41.579> highest<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> force

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
go to our the next highest are the force

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.980 
go to our the next highest are the force
and<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.280> pattern<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> already<00:01:45.509> says

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and because this pattern is already says

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
and because this pattern is already says
that<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.470> correct<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.430> these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that this is correct we know that these

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
that this is correct we know that these
two<00:01:47.909> cannot<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.509> correct<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.920> we're<00:01:50.070> actually

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
two cannot be correct so we're actually

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
two cannot be correct so we're actually
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> highlight<00:01:50.909> those<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.990> notice

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
going to highlight those two and notice

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
going to highlight those two and notice
that<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> green<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.430> says<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.970> are

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that the green then says they are

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
that the green then says they are
correct<00:01:54.420> we're<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.740> three

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
correct we're going to go to the three

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.100 
correct we're going to go to the three
next<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.000> we're<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> start<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
next and we're going to start with the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.170 
next and we're going to start with the
the<00:01:58.500> vertical<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> vertical<00:01:59.759> one

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the vertical one and the vertical one

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.170 
the vertical one and the vertical one
here<00:02:00.600> shows<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> could<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:03.000> or

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
here shows that it could be this one or

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.030 
here shows that it could be this one or
this<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.500> pattern<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this one but because this pattern is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
this one but because this pattern is
already<00:02:05.340> correct<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> must<00:02:06.810> be

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
already correct we know that it must be

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
already correct we know that it must be
this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.700> now<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:09.060> actually<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
this one now we can actually go back to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.240 
this one now we can actually go back to
this<00:02:10.470> five<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.190> reason<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.520> can

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
this five and the reason we can

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.250 
this five and the reason we can
because<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.880> pattern<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.720> bottom<00:02:14.230> one

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
because the pattern for this bottom one

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.590 
because the pattern for this bottom one
is<00:02:14.440> already<00:02:14.770> correct<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.060> we<00:02:16.150> know<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.300> this

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
is already correct so we know that this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200 
is already correct so we know that this
one<00:02:16.840> cannot<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.650> correct<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.910> makes

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
one cannot be correct and so that makes

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.840 
one cannot be correct and so that makes
this<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.170> correct<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.370> only<00:02:21.520> have

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
this one correct so then we only have

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.640 
this one correct so then we only have
one<00:02:21.880> more<00:02:22.480> left<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> 3<00:02:23.620> here

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
one more left so we have a 3 here

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.220 
one more left so we have a 3 here
there's<00:02:24.580> only<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:24.820> in<00:02:25.150> between<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.990> must

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
there's only one in between and it must

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.800 
there's only one in between and it must
be<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.740> correct<00:02:26.980> answer<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.510> see

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
be the correct answer and you can see

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.930 
be the correct answer and you can see
that<00:02:29.050> we've<00:02:29.650> solved<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.190> puzzle<00:02:30.310> so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
that we've solved the puzzle so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.850 
that we've solved the puzzle so
congratulations<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.860> actually<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:33.490> truck
