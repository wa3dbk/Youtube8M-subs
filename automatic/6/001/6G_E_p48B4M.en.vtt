and I'm going to try and hold the camera

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.400 
and I'm going to try and hold the camera
with<00:04:16.030> one<00:04:16.180> hand<00:04:16.419> while<00:04:16.540> I'm<00:04:16.720> doing<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.109> so

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
with one hand while I'm doing this so

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.320 
with one hand while I'm doing this so
bear<00:04:17.890> with<00:04:17.919> me<00:04:18.100> but<00:04:18.669> you<00:04:18.760> push<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.120> button

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
bear with me but you push this button

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.940 
bear with me but you push this button
and<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.690> steam<00:04:19.930> comes<00:04:20.200> out<00:04:20.350> hopefully<00:04:20.620> not

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
and the steam comes out hopefully not

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.370 
and the steam comes out hopefully not
because<00:04:21.340> it's<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.240> little<00:04:22.600> too<00:04:22.720> loud<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.350> I

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
because it's a little too loud so I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.070 
because it's a little too loud so I
could<00:04:23.860> voiceover<00:04:24.580> for<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:24.970> part<00:04:25.240> anyway

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
could voiceover for this part anyway

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.750 
could voiceover for this part anyway
what<00:04:26.350> we're<00:04:26.500> trying<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.830> do<00:04:27.040> right<00:04:27.220> here<00:04:27.280> is

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
what we're trying to do right here is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.250 
what we're trying to do right here is
froth<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.900> milk<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:31.330> takes<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.960> little<00:04:32.140> bit

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
froth the milk and it takes a little bit

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.590 
froth the milk and it takes a little bit
of<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.440> technique<00:04:32.830> because<00:04:33.250> what<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.300> have<00:04:34.360> to

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
of a technique because what you have to

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.860 
of a technique because what you have to
do<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.290> hold<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.160> steamer<00:04:36.940> all<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.780> way

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
do is is hold the steamer all the way

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.800 
do is is hold the steamer all the way
down<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.410> bottom<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.340> vessel<00:04:39.810> until

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
down to the bottom of the vessel until

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.720 
down to the bottom of the vessel until
it<00:04:41.050> gets<00:04:41.380> warm<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.220> certain<00:04:42.610> temperature

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
it gets warm to a certain temperature

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.080 
it gets warm to a certain temperature
and<00:04:43.150> then<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.360> slowly<00:04:43.720> back<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.620> off<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:46.060> that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
and then you slowly back it off so that

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.090 
and then you slowly back it off so that
you're<00:04:46.480> actually<00:04:46.720> lowering<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.440> vessel<00:04:47.890> and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
you're actually lowering the vessel and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.940 
you're actually lowering the vessel and
getting<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:48.940> steam<00:04:49.419> outlet<00:04:50.230> near<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.740> top

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
getting that steam outlet near the top

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.630 
getting that steam outlet near the top
of<00:04:50.980> that<00:04:51.370> liquid

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
of that liquid

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:02.040 
of that liquid
there<00:04:54.640> we<00:04:54.730> go<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.540> we<00:04:56.260> have<00:04:56.440> our<00:04:56.470> cup<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:01.540> we

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
product and you pour it out and then you

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.750 
product and you pour it out and then you
can<00:05:09.550> actually<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:10.150> know<00:05:11.220> make<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.250> little<00:05:12.550> I

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760
