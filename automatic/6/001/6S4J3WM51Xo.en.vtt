on any in the opponent's hand because
this<00:03:34.519> this<00:03:35.120> board<00:03:35.600> is<00:03:35.840> pretty<00:03:36.590> strong<00:03:36.950> even<00:03:37.400> if

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
this this board is pretty strong even if

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.120 
this this board is pretty strong even if
you<00:03:37.579> kill<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.880> giant<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.650> if<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.799> feel<00:03:39.980> the

you kill the giant and if you feel the
one<00:03:40.250> free<00:03:40.519> then<00:03:41.480> there<00:03:41.660> will<00:03:41.720> be<00:03:41.840> six<00:03:42.139> points

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
one free then there will be six points

know<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:06.170> gonna<00:04:06.319> be<00:04:06.470> really<00:04:06.620> tough<00:04:06.739> but

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
know it's gonna be really tough but

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.470 
know it's gonna be really tough but
let's<00:04:07.430> find<00:04:07.609> out<00:04:07.819> what<00:04:07.940> happened<00:04:08.239> cuz<00:04:08.359> he

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
let's find out what happened cuz he

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.289

might<00:04:08.720> try<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.019> use<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.709> Ruby<00:04:10.010> neg<00:04:10.220> as<00:04:10.910> lever

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
might try to use the Ruby neg as lever

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.569 
might try to use the Ruby neg as lever
to<00:04:11.509> maybe<00:04:11.840> juggle<00:04:12.380> one<00:04:12.470> more<00:04:12.620> time<00:04:12.829> if<00:04:13.100> not<00:04:13.400> he

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
to maybe juggle one more time if not he

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.689 
to maybe juggle one more time if not he
might<00:04:13.820> soul<00:04:14.090> fire<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.630> out<00:04:14.750> for

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
going on fire and he just he doesn't

discard a doom guard which is really
critical<00:04:23.290> do<00:04:23.710> guard<00:04:23.979> might<00:04:24.160> be<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.370> way<00:04:24.490> to

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
of damage but there are the taunts so it

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.110

multi giants earlier you would probably

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
double double molten giant on I think

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.900 
double double molten giant on I think
it's<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.520> little<00:05:09.880> too<00:05:10.090> risky<00:05:10.840> for<00:05:10.870> me<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.910> thank

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
no played a more than giant you've seen

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.920 
no played a more than giant you've seen
your<00:05:21.520> opponent<00:05:21.970> struggle<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.599> kill<00:05:22.810> the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
your opponent struggle to kill the

your opponent struggle to kill the
mountain<00:05:23.080> giant<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:23.770> now<00:05:23.919> you<00:05:23.979> get<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.250> molten

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
mountain giant so now you get a molten

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.879 
mountain giant so now you get a molten
leech<00:05:24.940> on<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.479> for<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.229> next<00:05:26.349> turn<00:05:26.590> he<00:05:26.770> got

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
leech on it and for the next turn he got

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.740 
leech on it and for the next turn he got
always<00:05:27.220> played<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.520> second<00:05:28.060> molten<00:05:28.360> giant<00:05:28.630> and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
always played a second molten giant and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.920 
always played a second molten giant and
sludge<00:05:28.990> Belcher<00:05:29.440> yes<00:05:29.949> and<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:31.060> far<00:05:31.360> after<00:05:31.780> that

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
sludge Belcher yes and so far after that

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.920 
sludge Belcher yes and so far after that
to<00:05:32.169> just<00:05:32.409> clear<00:05:32.940> something<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.419> don't<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:34.720> far

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
to just clear something you don't so far

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.570 
to just clear something you don't so far
the<00:05:35.050> knife<00:05:35.199> yarder<00:05:35.530> here<00:05:38.159> do<00:05:39.159> you<00:05:39.280> think<00:05:39.490> yeah

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
the knife yarder here do you think yeah

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.460 
the knife yarder here do you think yeah
I<00:05:39.880> think<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.389> have<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.599> soulfire<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.320> knife

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
I think you have to soulfire the knife

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.990 
I think you have to soulfire the knife
juggler<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:41.889> represents<00:05:42.310> too<00:05:42.430> much<00:05:42.580> potential

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
juggler it represents too much potential

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.820 
juggler it represents too much potential
damage<00:05:43.449> we<00:05:43.599> just<00:05:43.810> witness<00:05:44.169> what<00:05:44.349> happens<00:05:44.710> if

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
damage we just witness what happens if

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.680 
damage we just witness what happens if
you<00:05:44.919> leave<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.159> up<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:45.639> you<00:05:46.030> allows<00:05:46.300> you<00:05:46.539> to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
you leave it up and you allows you to

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.350 
you leave it up and you allows you to
tap<00:05:46.960> in<00:05:47.680> for<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.949> others<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.789> rn's<00:05:49.060> who<00:05:49.240> has

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
tap in for the others the rn's who has

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.050 
tap in for the others the rn's who has
only<00:05:49.539> two<00:05:49.630> cars<00:05:49.930> in<00:05:50.110> hell<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.500> I<00:05:51.340> feel<00:05:51.789> like<00:05:51.820> it

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
only two cars in hell and I feel like it

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.600 
only two cars in hell and I feel like it
might<00:05:52.210> be<00:05:52.270> risky

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
might be risky

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.869 
might be risky
oh<00:05:53.870> nice<00:05:54.870> and<00:05:55.139> so<00:05:55.319> this<00:05:56.129> is<00:05:56.310> perfect<00:05:56.490> for<00:05:56.849> him<00:05:56.939> I

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
oh nice and so this is perfect for him I

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.010 
oh nice and so this is perfect for him I
feel<00:05:59.879> like<00:05:59.969> this<00:06:00.180> was<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.419> best<00:06:00.569> card<00:06:00.900> to

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
feel like this was the best card to

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.730 
feel like this was the best card to
discard<00:06:02.900> yeah<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:03.960> think<00:06:04.349> I<00:06:04.469> would<00:06:04.620> have<00:06:04.680> been

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
discard yeah I think I would have been

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.219 
discard yeah I think I would have been
okay<00:06:05.189> with<00:06:05.400> Leroy<00:06:06.150> business<00:06:06.539> card<00:06:06.780> either<00:06:06.960> you

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
okay with Leroy business card either you

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.540 
okay with Leroy business card either you
don't<00:06:07.409> necessarily<00:06:07.560> need<00:06:07.889> to<00:06:08.039> rush<00:06:08.340> your

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
don't necessarily need to rush your

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.920 
don't necessarily need to rush your
opponent<00:06:08.939> down<00:06:09.090> you're<00:06:09.449> playing<00:06:09.689> a<00:06:09.810> really

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
opponent down you're playing a really

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.600 
opponent down you're playing a really
defensive<00:06:10.439> game<00:06:10.650> either<00:06:10.949> one<00:06:11.189> of<00:06:11.219> those<00:06:11.400> as

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
defensive game either one of those as

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.740 
defensive game either one of those as
long<00:06:11.759> as<00:06:11.849> you<00:06:11.909> don't<00:06:12.030> lose<00:06:12.150> maybe<00:06:12.360> molten

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
long as you don't lose maybe molten

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.929 
long as you don't lose maybe molten
giant<00:06:13.080> or<00:06:13.199> sludge<00:06:13.469> Belcher<00:06:13.919> well<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.759> thing

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
giant or sludge Belcher well the thing

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.929 
giant or sludge Belcher well the thing
is<00:06:14.969> that<00:06:15.270> if<00:06:15.889> molten<00:06:16.889> giant<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.520> two<00:06:17.699> free

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:17.939 
is that if molten giant and the two free

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:20.809 
is that if molten giant and the two free
survives<00:06:18.330> you<00:06:18.599> just<00:06:18.810> win<00:06:19.020> next<00:06:19.409> turn<00:06:19.710> so<00:06:20.520> Lyra

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
survives you just win next turn so Lyra

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.999 
survives you just win next turn so Lyra
is<00:06:20.879> pretty<00:06:21.240> important<00:06:21.629> here<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:21.990> if<00:06:22.500> your

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
is pretty important here and if your

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.649 
is pretty important here and if your
opponent<00:06:23.219> clears<00:06:23.639> you<00:06:23.909> can<00:06:24.060> still<00:06:24.330> play<00:06:24.539> the

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
opponent clears you can still play the

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.200 
opponent clears you can still play the
sludge<00:06:24.900> Belcher<00:06:25.349> and<00:06:25.500> a<00:06:25.710> molten<00:06:26.039> giant<00:06:26.370> that's

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
sludge Belcher and a molten giant that's

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.790 
sludge Belcher and a molten giant that's
why<00:06:27.419> I<00:06:27.449> feel<00:06:27.659> like<00:06:27.779> newer<00:06:28.050> ones<00:06:28.319> really

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
why I feel like newer ones really

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.390 
why I feel like newer ones really
important<00:06:30.319> mana<00:06:31.319> is<00:06:31.439> also<00:06:31.680> been<00:06:31.830> valuing<00:06:32.310> the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
important mana is also been valuing the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.369 
important mana is also been valuing the
gym<00:06:32.580> guard<00:06:32.819> so<00:06:33.060> much<00:06:33.300> but<00:06:33.539> that<00:06:33.719> the<00:06:33.900> doom<00:06:34.199> card

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
gym guard so much but that the doom card

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.830 
gym guard so much but that the doom card
might<00:06:34.680> never<00:06:35.099> be<00:06:35.370> played<00:06:35.639> this<00:06:35.849> game<00:06:35.969> is<00:06:36.389> a
