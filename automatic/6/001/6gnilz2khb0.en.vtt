 the inka roads of 2014 already 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.500
 they finished the road map tends to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.230
 the race that changes we take back the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.490
 Inca road hard for brave no 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.050
 matter the genre I'm not saying that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.990
 be male or female but for brave 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.700
 we have women pilots too 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.659
 we take that essence that america where not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.060
 those of the pilots, they will have it 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.130
 to suffer a little do not walk and here 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.640
 he has retired during all his first 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.840
 editions a long hard competition and 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.110
 is what we have taken up in this edition 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.340
 the first change always prime good 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.130
 right now we have a superprime that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.289
 unfortunately it has had to be canceled 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 by new restrictions on measures of 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.789
 security of the different entities 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.100
 who are involved in this topic there are 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.910
 new requirements and with more time 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.260
 authorization in this case we had 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.090
 requested more than 30 days ago 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.950
 gave the authorization of multiple 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.810
 chorrillos but and start new ones 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.060
 requirements and arising while we were going 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.830
 moving forward and unfortunately it has not 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
 completed with everything so although 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.620
 we hope that on Thursday they can 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.360
 give but what happens if it does not arrive so 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.090
 I must decide in the morning of the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.590
 conference and to give it by annulled the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.019
 superprime and it has been a game 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.380
 symbolic on Friday at the beach 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.150
 fresh water at 1 and 3 in the afternoon 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.620
 with a pre-concentration from 12 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.100
 the day for the general public 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.320
 Lima can approach and take pictures 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.750
 with all the cars for almost 100 cars 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.900
 there on the beach of aguadulce with its 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.130
 favorite pilots get autographs and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.600
 then we will give them the symbolic game 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.980
 the changes in the first stage 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 basically there are some changes in stages 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.010
 where we have started certain stages we have 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.780
 match in two to allow 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.150
 with greater fluidity in normal transit 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.379
 because there are stages that close and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.640
 we complicate life is for those who 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.159
 they go south let's say we 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.019
 we are coming to the same direction and 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.980
 we are doing it well possible a 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.659
 little bit then we have also 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.030
 considered that camera the jewel is going to be 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.769
 a special to then continue the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.269
 link to the green hill tracks and 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.849
 start again continue specials 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.370
 of team we see also run the 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.030
 May cachi game in the part of the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.500
 cusco cell to wedge bridges 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.750
 avoid the area of limatambo that is in 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.920
 repairs and we do not know well in 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.670
 what state has been found on the day of 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.670
 on the day of the race 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.400
 abancay keeps going we have made a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.660
 small link for tire change not 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.790
 more but the route is maintained is 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.660
 only for the pilots because 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.220
 be the detour of matta puquio in what 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.410
 happens is that much progress has been made with 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.900
 the asphalt in that area had previously 20 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.880
 kilometers of 60 we prefer that 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.280
 pilots can continue with their lack and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.700
 then change in the stage the new stage 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.100
 is talavera sarawak there is no there 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.799
 changes is new stage 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.430
 talavera sarawak there is fungus ocobamba 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.590
 iguana guaraparí chincheros a cute 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.590
 special nice area 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.760
 in click for the pilots very funny 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.270
 driving is a long but very 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.980
 soft are going to have a lot of fun and go 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.380
 to be grateful that then there 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.800
 we have 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.350
 Dad I also cut in Ayacucho 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.450
 the sancho link 15 km in the area 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.880
 arrival to the wta of tokyo that also 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.290
 is in repairs and that neither 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.520
 make sure it is up to the tracks and not 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.500
 they are going to let allow for the track 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.200
 repairs or by detour the detour 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.300
 it is very dangerous this is a slope 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.890
 the cars would have to close to 11 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.670
 kilometers per hour then better what 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.380
 we link and leave again after 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.300
 he opens everything to travel to asia it will be done 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.800
 the arrival of accusation with the fourth stage 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.520
 it is not a change, therefore, a new stage 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.720
 huancavelica we have a link before ara 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.100
 coming to paucará it is linked up 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.630
 witch guys are two kilometers too 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.210
 again so that the pilots can 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.070
 change from asphalt tires to rims 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.070
 of land and then continue through all this 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.860
 new area towards huancavelica already 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.850
 mandatory and marshal cáceres that is 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.720
 a new one that is also in 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.010
 repairs that are going to leave 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.750
 spectacular 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.150
 It is also the same only 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.370
 the last stage that comes down from huancayo 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.660
 towards lunahuana before he has run towards 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.780
 up not down 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.729
 and we finish that manna is here 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.460

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.110
