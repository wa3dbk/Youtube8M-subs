point obey it's a good product to pick
up<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.420> metal<00:00:09.690> ions<00:00:10.020> in<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> water<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
up the metal ions in the water or the

draws them into a bag I'll show you the
product<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.099> now<00:00:14.540> so<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.630> has<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> bag<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
product right now so it has a bag with a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.109 
product right now so it has a bag with a
polymer<00:00:16.860> in<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.490> draws<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.880> metal

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
polymer in it and it draws the metal

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.179 
polymer in it and it draws the metal
ions<00:00:18.360> in<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.050> traps<00:00:19.680> them<00:00:19.919> and<00:00:20.070> that's

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
ions in here and traps them and that's

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.409 
ions in here and traps them and that's
how<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.399> get<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:20.730> metal<00:00:20.880> actually<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.360> of

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
how you get the metal actually out of

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:22.130 
how you get the metal actually out of
your<00:00:21.660> pool

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
your pool

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.260 
your pool
so<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.829> see<00:00:23.009> you<00:00:23.040> later<00:00:23.250> 4.0<00:00:23.790> is<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.210> you

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
so the see you later 4.0 is one when you

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.760 
so the see you later 4.0 is one when you
use<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.540> this<00:00:24.630> particular<00:00:24.869> account<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.680> it

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
use in this particular account and it

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.190 
use in this particular account and it
shows<00:00:25.919> it's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> high<00:00:26.309> level<00:00:26.579> of<00:00:27.270> metal<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
shows it's a high level of metal and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.929 
shows it's a high level of metal and
they<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.739> a<00:00:28.770> 1.0<00:00:29.309> that<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.669> add<00:00:29.790> to

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
they also have a 1.0 that you can add to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.340 
they also have a 1.0 that you can add to
the<00:00:30.059> skimmer

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470 

you<00:00:37.859> can<00:00:37.980> also<00:00:38.100> hit<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.640> Gatorade<00:00:39.089> to<00:00:39.239> put<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you can also hit in Gatorade to put it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
you can also hit in Gatorade to put it
in<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.289> that<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> don't<00:00:40.649> throw<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> away<00:00:40.859> an

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
in so that you don't throw it away an

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
I'm gonna have some dyeing cloth shock

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.970 
I'm gonna have some dyeing cloth shock
and<00:01:10.580> you'll<00:01:10.670> see<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.590> watercolor<00:01:12.590> actually

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
and you'll see the watercolor actually

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.400 
and you'll see the watercolor actually
changed<00:01:13.460> or<00:01:13.700> green<00:01:13.940> tint<00:01:14.330> when<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.230> coin

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
changed or green tint when the coin

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.210 
changed or green tint when the coin
activates<00:01:15.920> at<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.160> middle<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.040> water

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
activates at the middle and the water

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.740 
activates at the middle and the water
will<00:01:19.370> remain<00:01:19.580> clear<00:01:19.940> but<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.300> can<00:01:20.450> see<00:01:20.600> how

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
will remain clear but you can see how

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.600 
will remain clear but you can see how
the<00:01:20.810> metal<00:01:21.200> activates<00:01:21.950> with<00:01:22.190> chlorine<00:01:22.580> and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
the metal activates with chlorine and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.940 
the metal activates with chlorine and
changes<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> color<00:01:23.480> you<00:01:24.380> came<00:01:24.530> back<00:01:24.620> you<00:01:24.770> see

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
changes the color you came back you see

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.290 
changes the color you came back you see
more<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.220> green<00:01:25.400> tint<00:01:25.640> now<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.180> it's

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
more of the green tint now and that it's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.600 
more of the green tint now and that it's
more<00:01:26.630> time<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:26.960> passed<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.460> definitely

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
more time this passed and it definitely

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.030 
more time this passed and it definitely
has<00:01:29.000> reaction<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.050> some<00:01:30.410> kind<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.620> metal<00:01:30.890> in

to<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.120> even<00:04:48.419> darker<00:04:48.840> than<00:04:48.990> when<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.169> first

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
to it even darker than when I first

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.890

pulled it out at the initial treatment I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.600 
pulled it out at the initial treatment I
see<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.199> blue<00:04:52.350> along<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.770> edges<00:04:53.070> here<00:04:53.400> and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
see the blue along the edges here and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.700 
see the blue along the edges here and
it's<00:04:54.449> got<00:04:54.570> some<00:04:54.750> other<00:04:54.840> coloring<00:04:55.350> right<00:04:55.500> there

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
it's got some other coloring right there

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.830 
it's got some other coloring right there
too<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:56.790> here's<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.150> bag<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.360> hasn't<00:04:57.720> been

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
too and here's a bag that hasn't been

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.670 
too and here's a bag that hasn't been
used<00:04:58.110> before<00:04:58.350> 250m<00:04:59.130> next<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.639> each<00:04:59.760> other

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
used before 250m next to each other

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.960 
used before 250m next to each other
that's<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.770> one<00:05:01.919> I<00:05:01.949> just<00:05:02.010> pulled<00:05:02.400> out<00:05:02.550> and
