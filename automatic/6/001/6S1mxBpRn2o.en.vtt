00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
would be pretty scenic for doing a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
would be pretty scenic for doing a
panoramic<00:01:24.630> merger<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.259> make<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.040> image

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
panoramic merger to make it an image

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
panoramic merger to make it an image
that's<00:01:26.580> both<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.659> enlarged<00:01:28.080> Abul<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.740> lets

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that's both more enlarged Abul and lets

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.249 
that's both more enlarged Abul and lets
me<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> scene<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.930> shot

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
me get more of the scene in in one shot

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
me get more of the scene in in one shot
and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> standard<00:01:32.159> frame<00:01:32.490> shot<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.119> I've

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the Zeiss 35 f2 I've got it set back at

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.920 
the Zeiss 35 f2 I've got it set back at
on<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.380> tripod<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.150> camera<00:01:42.570> body

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
on my tripod and with this camera body

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
on my tripod and with this camera body
and<00:01:43.049> lens<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.560> sort<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> ascertain

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and lens you sort of have to ascertain

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.480 
and lens you sort of have to ascertain
where<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.909> nodal<00:01:45.360> point<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> lens<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
where the nodal point of the lens is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.700 
where the nodal point of the lens is
over<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> axis<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.570> rotation<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
over the axis of rotation so that you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
over the axis of rotation so that you
don't<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.009> parallax<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.030> panoramic

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
don't get parallax and your panoramic

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
don't get parallax and your panoramic
mergers<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.320> line<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.979> now

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
mergers so that they line up and now

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
mergers so that they line up and now
with<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> new<00:01:54.509> cameras<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> live<00:01:55.500> view<00:01:55.920> just

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
with the new cameras the live view just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.069 
with the new cameras the live view just
makes<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.670> cheating<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.570> turn<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.930> your

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
makes it like cheating you turn on your

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.670 
makes it like cheating you turn on your
live<00:01:58.290> view<00:01:59.030> have<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.210> grid<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:01.259> Nikon<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680

live view have your grid with Nikon I
know<00:02:01.920> there's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> grid<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.460> pretty<00:02:02.640> sure

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
know there's a grid I'm pretty sure

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.240 
know there's a grid I'm pretty sure
there<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.149> Canon<00:02:03.600> too<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.979> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
there is with Canon too and you can just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.709 
there is with Canon too and you can just
make<00:02:05.399> sure<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.240> overlap

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
make sure that you get your overlap

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
make sure that you get your overlap
right<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.409> I've<00:02:08.129> got<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.729> exposure<00:02:09.209> sort<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
right and I've got my exposure sort of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.479 
right and I've got my exposure sort of
calculated<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.730> over

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
calculated so that it's not over

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.610 
calculated so that it's not over
in<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> sky<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.569> not<00:02:13.719> underexposed<00:02:14.379> in<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
in the sky it's not underexposed in the

in the sky it's not underexposed in the
shadows<00:02:15.069> I'm<00:02:15.250> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.459> balancing<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.180> you

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
shadows I'm kind of balancing that you

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.390 
shadows I'm kind of balancing that you
have<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.930> look<00:02:17.079> at<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.319> entire<00:02:17.650> scene<00:02:18.040> because

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
have to look at the entire scene because

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.740 
have to look at the entire scene because

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
love doing panoramic murders they let me

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.030 
love doing panoramic murders they let me
get<00:02:33.549> much<00:02:34.030> bigger<00:02:34.269> prints<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.019> they<00:02:35.829> let<00:02:36.010> me

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
get much bigger prints and they let me

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.039 
get much bigger prints and they let me
capture<00:02:36.549> wider<00:02:37.090> scenes<00:02:37.510> without<00:02:37.780> the
