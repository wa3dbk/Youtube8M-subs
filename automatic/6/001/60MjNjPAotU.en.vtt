ideas however that plan was quite long
as<00:03:34.189> what<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.400> writing<00:03:34.909> in<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.720> don't<00:03:35.959> have<00:03:36.139> a

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
as what I writing in it you don't have a

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.869 
as what I writing in it you don't have a
long<00:03:36.349> time<00:03:36.620> in<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.889> exam<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.489> what<00:03:37.669> we<00:03:37.790> would

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
long time in the exam so what we would

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.520 
long time in the exam so what we would
advise<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.479> do<00:03:38.599> is<00:03:38.689> to<00:03:38.780> try<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.199> get<00:03:39.319> your

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
advise you to do is to try and get your

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.830 
advise you to do is to try and get your
planning<00:03:40.280> as<00:03:40.489> short<00:03:40.879> and<00:03:41.209> as<00:03:41.449> straightforward

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
planning as short and as straightforward

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.439 
planning as short and as straightforward
as<00:03:42.290> possible<00:03:42.379> so<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.669> same<00:03:43.909> plan<00:03:44.239> but

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
as possible so this is the same plan but

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.330 
as possible so this is the same plan but
written<00:03:44.659> out<00:03:44.750> more<00:03:44.959> quickly<00:03:45.139> one<00:03:45.979> student

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
written out more quickly one student

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.520 
written out more quickly one student
writes<00:03:46.699> to<00:03:47.090> contacting<00:03:47.720> parents<00:03:48.199> three

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
writes to contacting parents three

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.490 
writes to contacting parents three
learning<00:03:49.129> for<00:03:49.699> yes<00:03:50.269> distracting<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.049> fun<00:03:51.319> and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
learning for yes distracting but fun and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.129 
learning for yes distracting but fun and
that<00:03:51.979> would<00:03:52.129> be<00:03:52.250> fine<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:53.509> structure<00:03:54.079> your

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
that would be fine to structure your

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.259 
that would be fine to structure your
ideas<00:03:54.620> because<00:03:55.189> now<00:03:55.430> we've<00:03:55.729> got<00:03:55.879> your<00:03:56.030> plan

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
ideas because now we've got your plan

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.179 
ideas because now we've got your plan
what<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:56.930> can<00:03:57.109> do<00:03:57.259> is<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.500> can<00:03:57.530> think<00:03:57.979> about

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
what you can do is you can think about

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.770 
what you can do is you can think about

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
all of those things you think about in

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.749 
all of those things you think about in
one<00:03:59.959> at<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.109> time<00:04:00.379> first<00:04:00.680> we<00:04:01.009> develop<00:04:01.639> your

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:01.759 
one at a time first we develop your
