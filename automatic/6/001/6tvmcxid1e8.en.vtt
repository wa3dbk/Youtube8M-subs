 people who have already become accustomed to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 but the games crowd is not good and I'm going 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.610
 Sonso, you see, here it is. 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:42.689
 devices and printers is right here in the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 where is the mouse that will have written here 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.540
 You do not click open the window here. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.200
 O 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.880
 you see here in pointer options 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.860
 here it will be marked that the same 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 where are you going to take car hitch 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.270
 the accuracy of the content you say martin 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.140
 because if you have checked I will show 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.180
 for you 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.369
 according to the speed you move with 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.340
 to hand the mouse he will he will be 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.580
 moving faster is for people who 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.430
 accustomed to playing in-game online games 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.320
 sniper or like to use a lot of sight 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.500
 and this is not good people because 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.660
 the faster you tinker the mouse is 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.770
 the aim will not be accurate and you will 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.100
 miss the shots 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.040
 then you uncheck it here and configure 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.700
 here because when it is marked this 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 that you get used to 11 fast to 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.330
 Do you fiddle with your computer? 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.240
 after it clears the pta 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.280
 You already set up here the dow city 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.160
 usually will always be right here in the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.239
 worse than an increased case 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.130
 that I was used to the mouse 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.720
 the improvement I discovered this is something 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.110
 a little time and I'm reviewing the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.060
 You're going to win, that's all I'm going to win. 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.280
 I would like to show you that you liked the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.130
 video I liked it 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.959
 liked each other even if the channel register 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.650
 I'm going to start liking more video 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.489
