user<00:01:49.259> DST<00:01:49.770> et<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> dsdt<00:01:50.970> free<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.140> it's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
user DST et and dsdt free so it's

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
user DST et and dsdt free so it's
basically<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> same<00:01:53.070> thing<00:01:53.369> except<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.850> just

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
basically the same thing except you just

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.730 
basically the same thing except you just
have<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> click<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.600> whichever<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.560> need

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
have to click on whichever one you need

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.940 
have to click on whichever one you need
so<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.030> did<00:01:57.390> click<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:58.409> dsdt

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so as you can see I did click on do dsdt

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.420 
so as you can see I did click on do dsdt
free<00:01:59.490> which<00:01:59.939> is<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:00.960> z77<00:02:01.680> ds3

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
free which is what I use for my z77 ds3

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.530 
free which is what I use for my z77 ds3
H<00:02:02.670> motherboard<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.890> works<00:02:05.130> fine<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:06.299> you

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
H motherboard and it works fine as you

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.479 
H motherboard and it works fine as you
can<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> DST<00:02:07.560> tee<00:02:07.829> which<00:02:08.099> means<00:02:08.369> you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
can see use a DST tee which means you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.999 
can see use a DST tee which means you
can<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.840> made<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.229> DST<00:02:10.470> 0<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> have

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
can if you are made of DST 0 you have

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.070 
can if you are made of DST 0 you have
downloaded<00:02:11.520> 1<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.030> select

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
downloaded 1 you can select

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.350 
downloaded 1 you can select
easy<00:02:13.320> beasts<00:02:13.740> which<00:02:14.040> most<00:02:14.550> people<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:15.090> run

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
easy beasts which most people do run

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.780 
easy beasts which most people do run
just<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:16.020> if<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.620> gets<00:02:16.770> order<00:02:17.220> drivers<00:02:17.640> on

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
just to see if it gets order drivers on

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.110 
just to see if it gets order drivers on
a<00:02:17.820> song<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.290> first<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.580> select<00:02:20.970> one

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
a song so first you just do select one

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.090 
a song so first you just do select one
and<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:21.390> then<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.020> hit<00:02:22.170> driver's<00:02:22.620> tab<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and then then you hit driver's tab and

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.580 
and then then you hit driver's tab and
from<00:02:23.700> here<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.210> basically<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.410> do

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
from here is basically if you do

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.650 
from here is basically if you do
remember<00:02:26.040> also<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.850> previous<00:02:27.240> version<00:02:27.570> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
remember also in the previous version of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.200 
remember also in the previous version of
multi<00:02:27.960> bees<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.460> checkboxes

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
multi bees and it was all in checkboxes

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.390 
multi bees and it was all in checkboxes
but<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.600> they<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.050> sort<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> laid<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.280> an

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
but now they have sort of laid out in an

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.140 
but now they have sort of laid out in an
icon<00:02:32.880> way<00:02:33.060> which<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.570> kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.170> easier

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
icon way which is kind of more easier

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.520 
icon way which is kind of more easier
it's<00:02:36.150> basically<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> same<00:02:36.810> thing<00:02:37.110> except

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it's basically the same thing except

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.230 
it's basically the same thing except
you're<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:37.950> slightly<00:02:38.250> different<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
you're just slightly different in the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.000 
you're just slightly different in the
way<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:40.710> for

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
way you do it so as you can see for

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
way you do it so as you can see for
audio<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.690> selected<00:02:43.320> first<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.770> its<00:02:43.950> own<00:02:44.100> so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
audio is is selected first on its own so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.420 
audio is is selected first on its own so
it's<00:02:45.450> basically<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.650> same<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.310> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it's basically the same you just have to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.820 
it's basically the same you just have to
drop<00:02:47.670> down<00:02:47.910> whatever<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.290> mine<00:02:49.800> is

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
drop down whatever it is so mine is

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.150 
drop down whatever it is so mine is
usually<00:02:50.370> Realtek<00:02:50.970> ALC<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.620> know<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.920> don't

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
usually Realtek ALC then I know I don't

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.550 
usually Realtek ALC then I know I don't
need<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> DST<00:02:53.790> DS<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.120> without<00:02:54.270> DST<00:02:54.810> team<00:02:55.050> mine

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
need a DST DS or without DST team mine

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
need a DST DS or without DST team mine
is<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.760> select<00:02:56.910> which<00:02:57.240> one

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
is this one so you just select which one

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.870 
is this one so you just select which one
you<00:02:57.540> need<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:58.770> don't<00:02:58.920> usually<00:02:59.160> need<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.580> do

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
you need you don't usually need to do

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.320 
you need you don't usually need to do
these<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.020> am<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> z77<00:03:02.100> ds3<00:03:03.000> H

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
these because I am on the z77 ds3 H

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.210 
these because I am on the z77 ds3 H
there's<00:03:03.870> hardly<00:03:04.290> anything<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> do

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
there's hardly anything you have to do

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.030 
there's hardly anything you have to do
all<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.420> audio<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.620> network

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
all it is is the audio and the network

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040 
all it is is the audio and the network
and<00:03:08.310> that's<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.820> everything<00:03:09.270> else<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.630> works

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
and that's it everything else just works

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.560 
and that's it everything else just works
on<00:03:10.260> its<00:03:10.410> own<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.100> that's<00:03:11.760> why<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.000> do<00:03:12.120> recommend

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
on its own so that's why I do recommend

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.470 
on its own so that's why I do recommend
building<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.350> hackintosh<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.980> z77<00:03:14.730> ds3<00:03:15.330> h

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
building a hackintosh with z77 ds3 h

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.860 
building a hackintosh with z77 ds3 h
motherboards<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:17.160> all<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.870> anyway

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
motherboards but it's all on you anyway

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.310 
motherboards but it's all on you anyway
let's<00:03:19.140> move<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:20.640> want<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.880> do<00:03:21.690> a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
let's move on so if you do want to do a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.460 
let's move on so if you do want to do a
driver<00:03:23.190> for<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.550> disc<00:03:23.970> drive<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.780> basically<00:03:25.440> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
driver for a disc drive so basically a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.070 
driver for a disc drive so basically a
hard<00:03:26.370> drive<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:26.850> whatever<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:27.840> there's

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
hard drive or whatever then there's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.620 
hard drive or whatever then there's
graphics<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.220> need<00:03:29.370> graphics<00:03:29.630> there's

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
graphics if you need graphics there's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.660 
graphics if you need graphics there's
also<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:32.480> Mis<00:03:33.480> C<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.680> misc<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.430> call

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
also the Mis C or the misc you can call

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.080 
also the Mis C or the misc you can call
it<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:37.080> network<00:03:37.590> which<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.700> use<00:03:38.880> is

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it the network which I have to use is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.380 
it the network which I have to use is
the<00:03:39.300> atheros<00:03:39.989> driver<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:41.400> was<00:03:41.730> previously

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
