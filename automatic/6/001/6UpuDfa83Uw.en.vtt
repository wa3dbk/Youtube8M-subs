 from around the world in our channel in 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.039
 pax christi youtube multimedia this 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.780
 yearning arose four years ago the lord 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.019
 he began to put it little by little in my 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.019
 heart 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.850

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.110
 tell me you know I want you to do this 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.560
 I have always worked in media 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.810
 communication I started working on radio 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.550
 I work in the press as well and never had 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.390
 made television then like that is 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.400
 a concern and called six years ago 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.220
 I felt like doing some television 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.100
 to evangelize david there are so many 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.350
 things in the television shows that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.370
 they are not good sometimes for the family and 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.500
 we want to take the word of God 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.530
 always innovating not something that people 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.540
 can see and what can entertain you 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.360
 be fun the word of God because 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.790
 the word of God is not educated and sometimes 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.650
 he scolds him but you can also talk 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.140
 in a funny way the word of 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.510
 God gives life how long have you been 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.970
 meet with the Lord three years ago 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.040
 more or less good he has spoken to me 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.140
 many times in many ways but the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.420
 ignored he had ignored it but he has 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.460
 reached the point that touched not bottom and one 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.130
 he has to get up and there's nobody 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.210
 gets you up more than the psoe is the only 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.280
 way in which I have joined with Oscar 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.780
 and we have talked about these ideas 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.150
 seen everything he has in his head 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 and there is no other way but to support it and continue 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.320
 go ahead in this amen 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's start with this ministry a 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.430
 of the madness also that the gentleman has 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.350
 inspired to us is to make videos 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.510
 musicals that we already have in the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.950

 movies with Christian catholic message 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.690

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.780
 the family that we can see as a family 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.910
 also if with different themes playing 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.860
 from childhood by adults for the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.090
 young because this world is being 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.190
 spoiling in a very 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.590
 fast and we are still asleep 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.570
 then it's time to turn things around 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.360

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.070
