00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.320
 Hello welcome to my channel alelÃ­ 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.190
 beloved this time I want to show you 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.060
 how to make a syrup ppt so much therefore 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.920
 which means that I'm going to use the same 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.590
 amount of sugar as water 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.380
 then they can do it in weight is more 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.550
 Exactly I have this time a cup of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.680
 water and what a cup of sugar is and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.480
 Well, the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.190
 bring to fire 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.670
 the water along with the sugar and well 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.890
 do not confuse yourself with what is a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.900
 syrup and a syrup the syrup we have 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.489
 we've been using it I'm just going to 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.150
 stir to integrate what is the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.790
 sugar 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.990
 we will be using this syrup to 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.200
 increase the cake loaves for 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.910
 that we are very dry then this 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.250
 will serve us there are different types of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.110
 Syrup still depends how they want it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.300
 you I like this one because I do not 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.840
 it is neither so sweet nor so 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.980
 simple and apart is light is not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.230
 thick then it is very good 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.680
 so that consciousness in bread I am 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:29.630
 cooking at medium temperature 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.540
 Now I'm lowering the taste of 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.850
 something else they can do but in 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.590
 the moment that 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.330
 because it has already dissolved well 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.300
 Sugar is when we are going to be 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:48.040
 incorporating the orange peel 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.040
 lemon anise cinnamon or in this case 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.650
 we are going to do it at the moment that is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.780
 boiling 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.640
 and good if you are going to put this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.000
 some kind of liquor or whatever 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.670
 have alcohol and then they do not want that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.080
 know alcohol by children or what 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.000
 be 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.580
 they put him in the moment he is 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 boiling they put the liquor they let 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.170
 boil so that the alcohol evaporates 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.030
 but since it was preserved the taste of 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.310
 any liquor that you have 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.220
 go to put me in this case yes I want 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.560
 I know I have the flavor then I go 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.410
 to let me feel good and then I'll 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.360
 add what is my liquor I hope that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.730
 be syrup serve you a lot in 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.730
 any cake that you do then 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.030
 they will use it to increase it - the thing 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.100
 very important always this is the part 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.610
 of the face of what the coast is 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.000
 where the bread was baked I cut it for the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.840
 half then always put the syrup 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.870
 in this part where they cut because this 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.760
 part is the one that will absorb faster 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.700
 in case they are not going to cut their bread 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.500
 by nowhere 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.540
 just remove the coast from above 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.540
 so they can enter faster 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.440
 you must know to be able to 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.140
 moisten what is a sponge cake 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.870
 biscuit cake as you want to call it is 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.020
 if your bread is cold you should use 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.690
 always the hot syrup and if the bread 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.110
 is hot they must use the syrup 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.380
 cold 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.130
 in this way it will absorb faster 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.470
 the bread what is the syrup and well 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.720
 we are going to do it as they can do 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.140
 a little bottle of these we use 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.300
 for ball mustard or that chad 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.060
 but we're going to make a little hole 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.620
 tiny 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.500
 and in this way we will be 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.500
 connecting our cake our bread 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.150
 good friends, I hope you have served them 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:57.000
 or else you can do it with a 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.760
 spoon can also be 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.910
 good friends, I hope you have served them 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.950
 something this video and that good for 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.470
 the next time they make a cake no longer 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.200
 eat it dry do it with this syrup 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.760
 so much so much so and you will see that 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.709
 they will know their cake very differently 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.709
 see you until next time
