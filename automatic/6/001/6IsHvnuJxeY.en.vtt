you tap the rear touchpad you'll be

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.800 
you tap the rear touchpad you'll be
controlling<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.490> ferry<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.030> darkness<00:02:19.510> and

controlling the ferry of darkness and

controlling the ferry of darkness and
which<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.350> case<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.710> way<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.010> one

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
which in this case the way this one

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.950 
which in this case the way this one
works<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.120> ferries<00:02:22.450> not<00:02:22.600> able<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
works is that this ferries not able to

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.690 
works is that this ferries not able to
move<00:02:23.110> around<00:02:23.260> freely<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.220> light<00:02:24.400> ferry

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
move around freely like the light ferry

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.180 
move around freely like the light ferry
the<00:02:25.300> darkness<00:02:25.750> ferry<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.260> only<00:02:26.650> able<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
the darkness ferry is only able to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.040 
the darkness ferry is only able to
connect<00:02:27.670> with<00:02:27.790> objects<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.360> are<00:02:28.570> connected

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
connect with objects that are connected

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.600 
connect with objects that are connected
within<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.530> shadow<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.160> if<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.460> not

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
within the shadow so if it's not

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.370 
within the shadow so if it's not
connected<00:02:31.090> part<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> shadow<00:02:31.780> then<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
connected part of the shadow then it

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.080 
connected part of the shadow then it
won't<00:02:32.500> be<00:02:32.620> able<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.950> take<00:02:33.100> advantage<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.820> any

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
won't be able to take advantage of any

won't be able to take advantage of any
situation<00:02:34.780> at<00:02:34.930> hand<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.440> sometimes<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.950> have

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
situation at hand and sometimes you have

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
situation at hand and sometimes you have
to<00:02:36.190> wait<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.490> objects<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.420> right

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
to wait for objects to be at the right

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.870 
to wait for objects to be at the right
point<00:02:37.960> before<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.710> can<00:02:38.920> take<00:02:39.070> advantage<00:02:39.220> like

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
point before you can take advantage like

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.180 
point before you can take advantage like
that<00:02:40.150> such<00:02:40.480> as<00:02:40.660> helping<00:02:41.500> defeating<00:02:41.980> an<00:02:42.100> enemy

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
that such as helping defeating an enemy

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.370 
that such as helping defeating an enemy
unit<00:02:42.640> which<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.390> thought<00:02:43.600> was<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:43.960> nice

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
unit which I thought was a really nice

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.440 
unit which I thought was a really nice
twist<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.130> definitely<00:02:45.910> helped<00:02:46.180> out<00:02:46.300> with

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
twist and definitely helped out with

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.570 
twist and definitely helped out with
some<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> challenges<00:02:47.020> along<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.680> way<00:02:47.830> now

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
some of the challenges along the way now

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.920 
some of the challenges along the way now
pretty<00:02:48.790> much<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> whole<00:02:49.240> concept<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
pretty much the whole concept of the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.240 
pretty much the whole concept of the
game<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.860> you're<00:02:50.980> going<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.190> be

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
game here is that you're going to be

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.550 
game here is that you're going to be
going<00:02:51.460> from<00:02:51.580> point<00:02:51.910> A<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> point<00:02:52.360> B<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:53.050> along

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
going from point A to point B but along

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.110 
going from point A to point B but along
your<00:02:53.740> journey<00:02:53.920> you're<00:02:54.280> gonna<00:02:54.370> have<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:54.670> kinds

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
your journey you're gonna have all kinds

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.670 
your journey you're gonna have all kinds
of<00:02:55.180> different<00:02:55.360> challenges<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> more<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
of different challenges and the more you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
of different challenges and the more you
progress<00:02:56.920> through<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.400> game<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:58.180> harder<00:02:58.600> and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
progress through the game the harder and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.410 
progress through the game the harder and
harder<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.230> gets<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.970> terms<00:03:01.210> of<00:03:01.330> the

gameplay wise those nice the control
schemes<00:03:03.310> seem<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.700> work<00:03:03.940> however<00:03:04.660> sometimes

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
schemes seem to work however sometimes

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.630 
schemes seem to work however sometimes
there<00:03:05.170> might<00:03:05.290> be<00:03:05.350> an<00:03:05.530> issue<00:03:05.680> where<00:03:06.130> if<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.370> if

to go back and replay those and try to

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.720 
to go back and replay those and try to
find<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.620> memory<00:04:43.890> fragments<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.370> that's<00:04:44.550> one

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
find the memory fragments so that's one

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.850 
find the memory fragments so that's one
of<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.880> key<00:04:45.090> things<00:04:45.360> here<00:04:45.450> is<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.320> find<00:04:46.590> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
of the key things here is to find the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.710 
of the key things here is to find the
memory<00:04:47.100> fragments<00:04:47.820> because<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.360> end<00:04:48.510> it's

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
memory fragments because in the end it's

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.810 
memory fragments because in the end it's
gonna<00:04:48.870> give<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.230> full<00:04:49.440> story<00:04:49.620> instead<00:04:50.550> of

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
gonna give you the full story instead of

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.090 
gonna give you the full story instead of
bits<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.510> pieces<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.440> have<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> basic

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
bits and pieces and I have a basic

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.500 
bits and pieces and I have a basic
understanding<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> replay<00:04:54.090> value<00:04:54.120> here

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
understanding so the replay value here

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.880 
understanding so the replay value here
is<00:04:54.780> good<00:04:55.050> that's<00:04:55.320> if<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.650> didn't<00:04:55.830> do

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
is good that's if you didn't do

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.110 
is good that's if you didn't do
everything<00:04:55.980> right<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.430> first<00:04:56.460> time

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
everything right the first time

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.970 
everything right the first time
as<00:04:57.180> for<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.840> innovation<00:04:58.320> was<00:04:58.620> there<00:04:58.800> anything

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
as for the innovation was there anything

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.650 
as for the innovation was there anything
new<00:04:59.250> here<00:04:59.520> was<00:04:59.730> something<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.510> already

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
new here was something that we already

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.840 
new here was something that we already
seen<00:05:00.960> before<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.950> me<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.130> has<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> mixture

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
seen before and to me that has a mixture

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.760 
seen before and to me that has a mixture
of<00:05:02.940> bug<00:05:03.210> which<00:05:03.420> can<00:05:03.720> be<00:05:03.900> argued<00:05:04.320> but<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.560> did

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
of bug which can be argued but I did

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.500 
of bug which can be argued but I did
like<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.490> had<00:05:05.640> this<00:05:05.760> whole<00:05:06.030> vibe<00:05:06.300> in

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
like is that it had this whole vibe in

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.840 
like is that it had this whole vibe in
concepts<00:05:07.080> such<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:07.530> another<00:05:07.980> title<00:05:08.430> known<00:05:08.640> as

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
concepts such as another title known as

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.760 
concepts such as another title known as
limbo<00:05:09.390> which<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.960> thought<00:05:10.170> was<00:05:10.320> really<00:05:10.500> nice

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
limbo which I thought was really nice

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.410 
limbo which I thought was really nice
and<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.250> course<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.640> whole<00:05:11.790> concept<00:05:12.270> of

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
and of course the whole concept of

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.910 
and of course the whole concept of
controlling<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:13.050> Feria<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.530> light<00:05:13.710> and

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
controlling a Feria of light and

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.500 
controlling a Feria of light and
darkness<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.490> aid<00:05:14.640> this<00:05:14.910> little<00:05:15.150> girl<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.390> her

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
darkness to aid this little girl on her

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.750 
darkness to aid this little girl on her
journey<00:05:15.720> was<00:05:16.260> another<00:05:16.590> nice<00:05:16.860> concept<00:05:17.370> however

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
journey was another nice concept however

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.790 
journey was another nice concept however
there<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> couple<00:05:18.690> little<00:05:18.840> minor<00:05:19.290> issues

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
there is a couple little minor issues

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.070 
there is a couple little minor issues
one<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.460> them<00:05:20.640> is<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.970> controls<00:05:21.420> option<00:05:21.960> by

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
one of them is the controls option by

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.660 
one of them is the controls option by
using<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.500> front<00:05:22.740> touch<00:05:22.950> screen<00:05:23.220> in<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.520> rear

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
using the front touch screen in the rear

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.880 
using the front touch screen in the rear
touchpad<00:05:24.000> one<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:25.020> them<00:05:25.140> is<00:05:25.320> that<00:05:25.590> if<00:05:25.770> you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
touchpad one of them is that if you

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.470 
touchpad one of them is that if you
happen<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.160> be<00:05:26.250> playing<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.700> lot<00:05:26.820> sometimes<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
happen to be playing a lot sometimes the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.210 
happen to be playing a lot sometimes the
tip<00:05:27.690> of<00:05:27.810> your<00:05:27.840> fingers<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.590> get<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.800> bit<00:05:28.980> sweaty

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
tip of your fingers can get a bit sweaty

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.670 
tip of your fingers can get a bit sweaty
which<00:05:29.820> will<00:05:30.030> drag<00:05:30.300> on<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.780> game<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.230> thus

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
which will drag on to the game and thus

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.430 
which will drag on to the game and thus
making<00:05:32.040> it<00:05:32.310> very<00:05:32.640> difficult<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.480> play<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:34.260> if

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
making it very difficult to play so if

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.470 
making it very difficult to play so if
they<00:05:34.590> do<00:05:34.650> incorporate<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.850> update<00:05:36.300> which

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
they do incorporate the update which

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.390 
they do incorporate the update which
Japan<00:05:36.960> got<00:05:37.170> which<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.530> allow<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:37.740> to<00:05:37.950> use<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
Japan got which I allow you to use the

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.250 
Japan got which I allow you to use the
analog<00:05:38.850> sticks<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.390> the<00:05:39.510> PlayStation<00:05:40.080> Vita

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
analog sticks of the PlayStation Vita

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.710 
analog sticks of the PlayStation Vita
then<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:41.130> control<00:05:41.520> option<00:05:41.970> can<00:05:42.120> easily<00:05:42.600> be

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
then the control option can easily be

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.480 
then the control option can easily be
fixed<00:05:42.930> through<00:05:43.200> that<00:05:43.350> giving<00:05:44.040> players<00:05:44.310> a

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
fixed through that giving players a

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.460 
fixed through that giving players a
choice<00:05:44.730> if<00:05:44.970> they<00:05:45.000> want<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.390> use<00:05:45.570> option<00:05:45.990> one<00:05:46.290> or

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
choice if they want to use option one or

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.010 
choice if they want to use option one or
option<00:05:46.560> two<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.880> other<00:05:48.000> one<00:05:48.210> is<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.780> lack

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
option two and the other one is the lack

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.440 
option two and the other one is the lack
of<00:05:49.320> help<00:05:49.950> tools<00:05:50.370> on<00:05:50.640> your<00:05:50.880> journey<00:05:51.060> because<00:05:51.270> in

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
of help tools on your journey because in

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.210 
of help tools on your journey because in
the<00:05:51.540> very<00:05:51.690> beginning<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:52.260> just<00:05:52.440> get<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.590> basic

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
the very beginning you just get a basic

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.130 
the very beginning you just get a basic
breakdown<00:05:53.550> of<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:54.060> control<00:05:54.420> schemes<00:05:54.750> alright

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
breakdown of the control schemes alright

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.380 
breakdown of the control schemes alright
here<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.410> use<00:05:55.710> this<00:05:55.980> and<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.670> use<00:05:56.880> this<00:05:57.120> and

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
here you use this and you use this and

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.780 
here you use this and you use this and
that's<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.260> and<00:05:58.530> what<00:05:58.920> I<00:05:58.950> mean<00:05:59.190> is<00:05:59.400> that<00:05:59.430> it

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
that's it and what I mean is that it

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.220 
that's it and what I mean is that it
would<00:05:59.880> be<00:05:59.940> kind<00:06:00.120> of<00:06:00.210> nice<00:06:00.360> that<00:06:00.600> if<00:06:00.780> you<00:06:00.930> happen

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
would be kind of nice that if you happen

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.810
