blown across I do I think it's worth it
I<00:02:08.690> told<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.170> truth

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
I told the truth

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.380 
I told the truth
it's<00:02:09.799> valid<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.489> true<00:02:10.519> and<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.209> meet<00:02:11.360> people

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's valid and true and to meet people

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.970 
it's valid and true and to meet people
that's<00:02:11.930> not<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> point<00:02:12.410> where<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.799> tell

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
that's not the point where do you tell

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:29.190 
that's not the point where do you tell
the<00:02:13.069> truth<00:02:13.280> or<00:02:13.459> not

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
