above the tank and also right up here
above<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> tank<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.590> station<00:00:40.590> number<00:00:40.620> 6<00:00:42.620> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
generator here so there are 6 generators

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.950 
generator here so there are 6 generators
on<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> map<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> fill<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.329> but

it sucks that I had a zombie up here so
I<00:01:56.770> got<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.100> train<00:01:57.430> up<00:01:57.610> here<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.060> tank<00:02:00.509> but

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
I got a train up here on the tank but

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
I got a train up here on the tank but
what<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.869> tank<00:02:02.140> does<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.479> drives<00:02:04.479> around

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
what the tank does is it drives around

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.639 
what the tank does is it drives around
this<00:02:06.130> part<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.670> map<00:02:07.289> which<00:02:08.289> is<00:02:08.440> called

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
this part of the map which is called

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.880 
this part of the map which is called
no-man's<00:02:09.130> land<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:10.750> flattens<00:02:11.290> out<00:02:11.650> all

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
no-man's land and it flattens out all

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.000 
no-man's land and it flattens out all
the<00:02:12.069> mud<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.540> way<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.319> can<00:02:14.530> run<00:02:14.680> fast

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the mud so that way you can run fast

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.880 
the mud so that way you can run fast
around<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.519> mud<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.230> guys<00:02:17.380> think<00:02:17.739> it's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
around the mud so if you guys think it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.780 
around the mud so if you guys think it's
a<00:02:17.980> good<00:02:18.190> idea<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:19.769> hold<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.950> down<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.459> tank

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
a good idea to hold it down on this tank

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.240 
a good idea to hold it down on this tank
and<00:02:22.060> start<00:02:22.599> start<00:02:23.050> around<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.769> try<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.010> kill

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and start start around and try to kill

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.370 
and start start around and try to kill
all<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.519> zombies<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.060> tank<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.630> don't

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
all the zombies on the tank I don't

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.050 
all the zombies on the tank I don't
recommend<00:02:26.709> doing<00:02:26.950> it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
recommend doing it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.380 
recommend doing it
this<00:02:28.630> tank<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.080> kind<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.090> bus<00:02:31.090> on

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
this tank is kind of like the bus on

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.770 
this tank is kind of like the bus on
transit<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:33.100> stops<00:02:33.580> at<00:02:33.819> certain<00:02:34.150> locations

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
transit it stops at certain locations

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.559 
transit it stops at certain locations
and<00:02:35.049> when<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> stops<00:02:35.860> at<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.100> certain<00:02:36.430> location

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
and when it stops at a certain location

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.089 
and when it stops at a certain location
you're<00:02:37.569> gonna<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.840> some<00:02:38.049> bees<00:02:38.260> rushing<00:02:38.980> in

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
you're gonna have some bees rushing in

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.750 
you're gonna have some bees rushing in
at<00:02:39.310> you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
at you

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.660 
at you
the<00:02:40.450> zombies<00:02:40.870> jump<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.680> from<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> left<00:02:42.459> side

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the zombies jump up from the left side

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.390 
the zombies jump up from the left side
right<00:02:42.700> side<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.080> tank<00:02:44.319> back<00:02:44.709> side<00:02:45.010> front

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
right side of the tank back side front

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
right side of the tank back side front
side<00:02:45.720> they<00:02:46.720> totally<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.230> trap<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:48.040> right<00:02:48.280> in

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
side they totally just trap you right in

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.470 
side they totally just trap you right in
when<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> tank<00:02:50.799> stops<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.640> that's<00:02:52.030> why<00:02:52.239> it's

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
when the tank stops so that's why it's

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.300 
when the tank stops so that's why it's
not<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.690> good<00:02:52.959> idea<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.470> help<00:02:53.680> try<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.890> hold<00:02:54.160> it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
not a good idea to help try to hold it

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.990 
not a good idea to help try to hold it
down<00:02:54.489> if<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:55.540> like<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> low<00:02:56.019> round<00:02:56.670> yeah<00:02:57.670> I

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
down if it's like a low round yeah I

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.789 
down if it's like a low round yeah I
mean<00:02:58.299> it's<00:02:58.510> really<00:02:58.720> not<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.140> hard<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.440> do<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
mean it's really not that hard to do it

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.030 
mean it's really not that hard to do it
but<00:03:00.329> passed<00:03:01.329> like<00:03:01.630> around<00:03:01.840> 10:15

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
but passed like around 10:15

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160 
but passed like around 10:15
it<00:03:03.549> can<00:03:03.730> get<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.940> little<00:03:04.120> crazy<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.690> mean<00:03:05.049> you

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it can get a little crazy I mean you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.780 
it can get a little crazy I mean you
could<00:03:05.320> do<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.799> have<00:03:05.920> good<00:03:06.160> weapons<00:03:06.579> but

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
could do it if you have good weapons but

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.490 
could do it if you have good weapons but
I<00:03:06.820> really<00:03:07.150> don't<00:03:07.269> recommend<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.989> why<00:03:08.140> chance
