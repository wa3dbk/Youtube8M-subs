 timi double montaguto 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.510
 if they are looking for madonna time first 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.430
 let's take a yellow sachet that 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.340
 should match that of the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 fries we are in the town 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.910
 with these lines and add two 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.910
 water glasses 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 the consistency, however, will be the compound 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 fries now we will go to 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.330
 flatten it and then informed the Milan 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 for about 10 seconds and mode 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.800
 let's say medium high 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.680
 and while admitting this sachet 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.010
 orange red bar that will match 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.400
 to the bread and we will put together two measuring cups 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.400
 of water 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.270
 it's nice 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.510

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.060

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.180
 medium high 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.849
 I was afraid they would burn instead 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.269
 I would say that if in perfect nudes they are 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.549

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.680
