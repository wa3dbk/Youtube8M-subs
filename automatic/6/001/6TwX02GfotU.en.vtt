 repair samsung syncmaster 2233 monitor 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.519
 and accordingly we say so 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.150
 using such 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.010
 lamp tester I will show you how 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.170
 check the lamps and accordingly 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.340
 was to understand what's next 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.109
 the continuation of the video about this is not 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.109
 gets points 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.199
 you fear allows you to clamp the lamp to 23 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.860
 up to 32 inches 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.410
 power from 12 to 24 volts 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 somehow min blow the power supply no less than 3 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.339
 ampere 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.829
 we have 3 ampere instant turned off to the bottom 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.659
 you can see what you mean for the power of gray 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 that is normally lit up there they have 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:02.540
 should be when all 4 she will be all 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.809
 ok there is of course some signs 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.809
 it is uncritical 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.320
 by somewhere visible punches somewhere 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.030
 having lived a lamp accordingly red 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.690
 the price of a native inverter it will not turn on 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.070
 you won't see anything 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.990
 well, it is necessary to further disassemble to look well 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.200
 I do not know 7 lyceum gradually tweeter 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 ignites a little brightens well 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.670
 on the facts there is visible tester work with 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.470
 native we would not have lit
