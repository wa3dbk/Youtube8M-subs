00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.519
 which I'm doing a tutorial of how 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.980
 avoid being banned or this is not assured 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.380
 that you are not good do not be 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.609
 banned but if it reduces the risk that 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.430
 you are bathed 70% 80% of extras 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.080
 banned software 3 due to des for 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.180
 unlock the camouflages and 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.130
 epic games medals that you already know 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.699
 they were exclusive to them and that they 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.730
 impute situ the use and well then 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.250
 I will show how to avoid how 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.190
 reduce the risk to be bathed and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.199
 well then 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.230
 once we have our profile in 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.460
 our usb memory if you do not know how 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.990
 pass profile 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.030
 above is a video of how to pass 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 the skins there shows how to pass the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.290
 memory I say the profile and the player data 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.660

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.520

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.230
 do it well now what are we going to 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.730
 to do is connect our usb memory and 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.130
 with our profile and our players 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.630
 dates of gears of war 3 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 we connect 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 begins not recognized 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.490
 there it is once we connect it 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.880
 let's ignore these 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.420
 windows ads 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.619

 let's see that here flash appears 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.950
 drive and good all these things do not 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.260
 so what are we going to do here is a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.440
 gamer profile we are going to 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.700

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.820

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.550
 we have to search and good practically 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.360
 we are doing this the same as 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.640
 we made to pass them epic skins 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.870
 games to our profile but now it's going to 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.870

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.600
 how can you tell them a slight change and 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.210
 well once we found this 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.420
 file let's give right click 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.340
 abstract 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.349
 let's leave it like this I 'll keep it 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.349
 on the desk and give save 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.430
 It is important that you do not change the 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.439
 name give him ok 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.359

 let's give here in our c's the former 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.659
 file 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 we will also save it 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 and once we did that we're going to give 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.090
 Right click on the profile and then 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.090
 let's erase 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.090
 here wow fox 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.099
 there it is but it was extracting 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.060
 already once we extracted it we're going to do 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.170
 right click and delete let's see that yes 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.610
 and now what we 're going to do is open 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.890
 this program that I am also going to 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.250
 leave the description of the video that is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.560

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.020
 let's open the minimize the horizon 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.230
 you do not have to close it and well once here 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.760
 in gp2 we are going to give file open and what 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.800
 first that he's going to open us he asks 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.010
 here is the gp from which I extracted and we go 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.470
 to do time here is I do not have the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.170
 We are going to give it to open and it will open 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.520
 right away another window and let's look 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.560
 now the profile that you have is 000 and 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.200
 several letters letters and numbers we're going 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.959
 to open 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.489
 and see here if you have the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.040
 camouflages are going to have these two 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.310
 checked 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.010
 it is important what 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.920
 that disable 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.690
 if you have the camouflage 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.630
 using it like that that's going to have these two 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.250
 this is called palomeadas then 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.590
 once we have entered here we are going to 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.300
 see them I already had them 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.840
 selected before so I do not go 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.800
 going and well, it's the only thing 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 we have to do 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.500
 To who 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.370
 here nothing moves and well then here 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.220
 the only thing we are going to do 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.889
 what's your name you can remove these two 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:57.440
 pigeons and select them and we're going to give 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:59.900
 in file 6 and ok we close the god war 3 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.889
 that I asked thor we opened it again the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.510
 say let's inject a file 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:11.890
 our profile that of 00 various numbers 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.890
 we hope here there will be 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.260
 and why these collapsed because these 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.380
 how to say these pigeons those squares 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.360
 Well, because the epic games 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.680
 they have a certain control a certain 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.820
 record of those who are 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.139
 benach and the inyecto already has a certain 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.940
 record of those who are employed and 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.570
 gears of war 3 programmers and good 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:44.350
 they remove our option 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.930
 what we have is this 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.449
 as i will tell you 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.240
 removing this option we no longer appear in 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.699
 the lists of your workers and good 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.790
 Well now what we're going to do is give you 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.800
 here to the profile here to the big one 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:07.580
 let's find the same file that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:10.160
 we look for this trail 4 of 53 08 bird here 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.840
 we are right clicking and now what 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.360
 let's do is give replace or 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.100
 replace we look here for the one that we have 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.100
 on the desk is this 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.749
 and we wait for it to be replaced 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.659
 let's go ok and once we've done 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:29.220
 this is going to give 66 here on the button 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.560
 orange 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.780
 and well, we're waiting for it to be saved and 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.610
 ready, it will be ready and good, well, my 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.980
 recommendation so that we did not mania is 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.800
 stop using the camouflages 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.680
 camouflages of epic games and medals 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.960
 I do not know who use them I do not know a week to 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.510
 bush in the and stop using two or 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.510
 three days reuse a week and 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.020
 let's stop using like this two or three days each 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.820
 Once again they wish them the 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.460
 skins the software and the medals the 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.340
 medals are saved what 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.960
 I recommend is not to use them and 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.140
 skins and they are deleted here is these 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.700
 two options and that's why every time 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.480
 that we want again the two skins 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.240
 we are going to have to do the process of 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.250
 like how to have them or going back to 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.710
 put everything here is exactly the same 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.790
 only that again going back to palomear 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:26.070
 the epic laughter in player and be the peak of 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.380
 be love in those two you have to go back to 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:32.360
 palomear every time we want 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.360
 our as i will tell you 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.729
 our 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.810
 our speak skins of epic games and 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.879
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.669
 the video we see each other until the next 

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:46.060
 serve them and good until the 'u' 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:46.060
