00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
do we decide well the first thing you

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900 
do we decide well the first thing you
have<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.930> remember<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.640> waiters<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
have to remember that waiters and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
have to remember that waiters and
servers<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> u.s.<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:26.039> paid<00:00:26.369> by

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
servers in the u.s. don't get paid by

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.070 
servers in the u.s. don't get paid by
the<00:00:26.640> hour<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.599> less<00:00:27.900> than

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the hour really they get less than

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.490 
the hour really they get less than
minimum<00:00:28.289> wage<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.189> depend<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> tips

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
minimum wage so they depend on the tips

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
minimum wage so they depend on the tips
if<00:00:31.500> they're<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> decent<00:00:32.309> server<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:33.210> much

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
if they're like a decent server how much

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
if they're like a decent server how much
do<00:00:33.600> they<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.960> per<00:00:34.170> hour<00:00:34.320> most<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.460> usually

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
do they get per hour most it's usually

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.229 
do they get per hour most it's usually
anywhere<00:00:36.600> between<00:00:37.340> two<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.640> three<00:00:38.730> dollars

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
anywhere between two and three dollars

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.110 
anywhere between two and three dollars
an<00:00:39.450> hour<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.399> very<00:00:41.640> low<00:00:41.790> much

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
an hour it's a it's very very low much

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
an hour it's a it's very very low much
lower<00:00:42.360> than<00:00:42.510> minimum<00:00:42.780> wage<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.680> they're<00:00:43.800> not

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
lower than minimum wage so they're not

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
lower than minimum wage so they're not
making<00:00:44.129> money<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> restaurant<00:00:45.840> they're

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
making money from the restaurant they're

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
really nice place even the really nice

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.760 
really nice place even the really nice
few<00:00:49.739> places<00:00:50.899> because<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> depends<00:00:52.710> on

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
few places because so it depends on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680 
few places because so it depends on
their<00:00:52.920> service<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> feel<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.449> they

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
their service so if you feel that they

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.869 
their service so if you feel that they
were<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.020> attentive<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.699> did<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
were really attentive and they did a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
were really attentive and they did a
great<00:00:57.030> job<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.840> were<00:00:57.899> friendly<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
great job and they were friendly and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
great job and they were friendly and
they<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.609> we're<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.120> clean-cut

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
they just you know we're like clean-cut

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
they just you know we're like clean-cut
or<00:01:01.050> whatever<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.280> usually<00:01:02.430> leave

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
or whatever you like you usually leave

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
or whatever you like you usually leave
20<00:01:03.239> percent<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:04.920> something<00:01:05.280> wrong

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
20 percent if there was something wrong

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.990 
20 percent if there was something wrong
that<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.450> did<00:01:06.689> specifically<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.220> could<00:01:08.430> go

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that they did specifically you could go

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
that they did specifically you could go
down<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> 15<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:09.990> were<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.260> really

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
down to 15 if they were just really

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
down to 15 if they were just really
really<00:01:10.950> awful<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.840> would

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really awful and that's when we would

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.890 
really awful and that's when we would
typically<00:01:13.439> leave<00:01:13.799> ten<00:01:14.310> percent<00:01:14.760> okay<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
typically leave ten percent okay but you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
typically leave ten percent okay but you
would<00:01:16.020> never<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.530> leave<00:01:16.680> nothing<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.340> walk

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
would never just leave nothing and walk

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210 
would never just leave nothing and walk
out<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:17.700> no<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:19.220> relationship

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
out right no you would like relationship

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.429 
out right no you would like relationship
like<00:01:20.490> ten<00:01:20.790> percent<00:01:20.939> let's<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.840> server<00:01:22.140> know

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
like ten percent let's a server know

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109 
like ten percent let's a server know
that<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.830> didn't<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.460> job<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.939> maybe

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that they didn't do a good job and maybe

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.609 
that they didn't do a good job and maybe
they'll<00:01:24.330> think<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> later<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.439> should

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
they'll think about it later they should

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
they'll think about it later they should
do<00:01:25.740> better<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.729> ever<00:01:26.850> want

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
do better but you just don't ever want

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.899 
do better but you just don't ever want
to<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.390> penalize<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.220> food<00:01:29.220> being<00:01:29.670> bad

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909

or something like that yeah control over

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
or something like that yeah control over
that<00:01:33.000> yeah<00:01:33.390> exactly<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.259> you've<00:01:34.409> worked<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.069 
like you give them twenty percent you
know<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.899> they're

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
know if they do what they can if they're

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.840 
know if they do what they can if they're
really<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.619> awful<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:47.159> even<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.579> would

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
really really awful like even I would

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
really really awful like even I would
leave<00:01:48.090> ten<00:01:48.390> percent<00:01:48.810> absolutely<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.979> then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
leave ten percent absolutely and then

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
leave ten percent absolutely and then
the<00:01:50.220> other<00:01:50.340> question<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:51.000> sometimes<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the other question I get sometimes is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.780 
the other question I get sometimes is
how<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:53.130> restaurant<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
how do you know when a restaurant is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.630 
how do you know when a restaurant is
going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> give<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> free<00:01:54.420> refills<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:55.229> soda

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
going to give you free refills on soda

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
going to give you free refills on soda
well<00:01:56.689> that's<00:01:57.689> tricky<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.500> sometimes

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
well that's tricky because sometimes

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.270 
well that's tricky because sometimes
they<00:02:00.270> say<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> on

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
they say it on

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.550 
they say it on
sometimes<00:02:01.729> they<00:02:01.820> don't<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:03.200> what<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:03.440> they

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
sometimes they don't so what if they

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.170 
sometimes they don't so what if they
don't<00:02:03.770> say<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.010> if<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:04.400> don't<00:02:04.580> say<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.880> you

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
don't say it if they don't say it you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.780 
don't say it if they don't say it you
can<00:02:05.360> either<00:02:05.540> ask<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:06.650> before<00:02:07.100> your<00:02:07.310> next

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
can either ask like before your next

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.389 
can either ask like before your next
refill<00:02:08.270> or<00:02:08.690> whatever<00:02:08.990> or<00:02:09.649> if<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.069> server<00:02:10.310> just

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
refill or whatever or if the server just

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.490 
refill or whatever or if the server just
brings<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.120> your<00:02:11.420> drink<00:02:11.750> again<00:02:11.990> without

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
asking and it's a free refill if they

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.090 
asking and it's a free refill if they
ask<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.050> if<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.230> want<00:02:15.410> another<00:02:15.590> one

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
ask you if you want another one

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.890 
ask you if you want another one
you<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.240> perfect<00:02:17.480> time<00:02:17.750> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
you can that's like a perfect time to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.780 
you can that's like a perfect time to
say<00:02:18.080> oh<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> free<00:02:19.250> refill<00:02:19.430> oh

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
say oh is it like a free refill oh

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.580 
say oh is it like a free refill oh
that's<00:02:20.060> no<00:02:20.300> problem<00:02:20.330> okay<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.080> that's<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.440> good

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that's no problem okay so that's a good

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.050 
that's no problem okay so that's a good
rule<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.800> thumb<00:02:22.069> if<00:02:22.250> they're<00:02:22.400> asking<00:02:22.910> you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
rule of thumb if they're asking you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.510 
rule of thumb if they're asking you
they're<00:02:23.330> charging<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:24.069> possibly<00:02:25.069> most<00:02:25.280> of

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
they're charging you possibly most of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.160 
they're charging you possibly most of
the<00:02:25.610> time<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:25.970> if<00:02:26.090> they<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.420> bring<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.750> then

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the time but if they just bring it then

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.489 
the time but if they just bring it then
they're<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.470> charging<00:02:27.860> okay<00:02:28.190> cool
