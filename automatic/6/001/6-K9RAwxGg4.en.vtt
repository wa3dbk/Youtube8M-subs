against<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> door<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.119> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
against the door like so so it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
against the door like so so it's
basically<00:01:33.450> blocking<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.170> door<00:01:34.350> therefore

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
basically blocking the door therefore

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.289 
basically blocking the door therefore
you<00:01:35.430> won't<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.700> able<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> drive<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> your

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
garage and like you will but you won't

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679

be<00:01:37.860> able<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.700> cought<00:01:38.970> seen<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
be able to get cought seen in all that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.990

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.960 
and just cool let's do feel a piece of
need<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.710> them<00:03:10.830> off<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.340> then<00:03:11.790> just

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
need to get them off you and then just

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.210 
need to get them off you and then just
drive<00:03:12.120> into<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.420> garage<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.080> as<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.350> see<00:03:13.740> there

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
drive into a garage and as you see there

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.130 
drive into a garage and as you see there
is<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> black<00:03:14.670> screen<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.360> do<00:03:15.570> not<00:03:15.720> see<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
is a black screen and you do not see the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.700 
is a black screen and you do not see the
cutscene<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.460> is<00:03:17.640> why<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.210> good<00:03:18.480> and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
cutscene so that is why this is good and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.620 
cutscene so that is why this is good and
yeah<00:03:19.710> so<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:20.760> why<00:03:20.940> its<00:03:21.090> user<00:03:21.300> journey

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
yeah so that's why its user journey

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.110 
yeah so that's why its user journey
anyway<00:03:22.350> once<00:03:22.590> you've<00:03:22.830> been<00:03:23.010> driven<00:03:23.640> you're<00:03:24.000> in

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
anyway once you've been driven you're in

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.640 
anyway once you've been driven you're in
the<00:03:24.240> car<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:25.020> see<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> hook<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.470> still

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the car I just see the hook is still

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.080 
the car I just see the hook is still
there<00:03:25.800> dead<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.310> you're<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.580> body<00:03:26.790> there

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
there dead and you're the body there

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.590 
there dead and you're the body there

of the car you don't have to use LEDs to

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.410 
of the car you don't have to use LEDs to
swap<00:03:45.270> it<00:03:45.420> but<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.930> energies<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.890> bypass<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.910> 45

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420
