00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
order for about six months and it's been

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.590 
order for about six months and it's been
a<00:00:19.410> long<00:00:19.920> time<00:00:20.130> coming<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> always<00:00:21.390> seem<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
a long time coming I always seem to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.830 
a long time coming I always seem to
place<00:00:21.900> my<00:00:22.080> order<00:00:22.109> right<00:00:22.609> before<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.000> logs<00:00:24.449> get

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840

place my order right before the logs get
out<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> control<00:00:25.550> just<00:00:26.550> seems<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.119> what

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
out of control just seems to be what

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.470 
out of control just seems to be what
happens<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.890> me<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> place<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
happens with with me so when I place the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.940 
happens with with me so when I place the
order<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.260> was<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.669> eight<00:00:32.940> weeks<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.540> think

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
order it was about eight weeks I think

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
order it was about eight weeks I think
but<00:00:34.950> right<00:00:35.340> after<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.880> placed<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> order

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
but right after I placed the order

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.959 
but right after I placed the order
things<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.380> backlogged<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.579> stuff

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
things got backlogged you know stuff

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.049 
things got backlogged you know stuff
happens<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.040> here<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.219> six<00:00:41.610> months<00:00:41.879> later

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
happens and here we are six months later

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.220 
happens and here we are six months later
but<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.930> it's<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
but I got it so this is the it's not the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
but I got it so this is the it's not the
tie<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.219> full<00:00:47.489> titanium<00:00:47.850> version

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
tie it's not the full titanium version

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
tie it's not the full titanium version
obviously<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> g10<00:00:49.590> version<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.129> went

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
obviously it's the g10 version I went

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.290 
obviously it's the g10 version I went
with<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.440> coyote<00:00:52.440> brown<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.460> with

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the Vulcan blade finish which I think

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.470 
the Vulcan blade finish which I think
looks<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.300> cool<00:00:58.100> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.399> heat<00:01:00.149> treat

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

steel<00:01:34.880> pillar<00:01:35.880> construction<00:01:37.700> one<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:38.850> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
steel pillar construction one thing that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990 
steel pillar construction one thing that
I<00:01:39.030> found<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.509> pretty<00:01:39.780> cool<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.400> stop

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I found that's pretty cool is the stop

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.679 
I found that's pretty cool is the stop
pin<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.310> acts<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> stop<00:01:45.240> pin<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
pin right here acts as the stop pin for

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
pin right here acts as the stop pin for
the<00:01:45.750> closed<00:01:45.990> position<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.310> right

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the closed position you can see right

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
the closed position you can see right
there<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:48.329> well<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:48.990> obvious<00:01:49.320> open

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there as well as the obvious open

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.550 
there as well as the obvious open
position<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.509> first<00:01:51.840> knife<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.350> can

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
position this is the first knife I can

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.330 
position this is the first knife I can
think<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:54.320> does<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> pretty

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
think of that does that which is pretty

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.649 
think of that does that which is pretty
cool<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.210> how<00:01:57.770> fits<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> hand

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
cool you can see how fits in the hand

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
cool you can see how fits in the hand
it's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.810> cool<00:02:00.990> knife<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it's a cool knife I really like the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.149 
it's a cool knife I really like the
design<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.030> opinion<00:02:03.619> Medford<00:02:04.619> stuff<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
design in my opinion Medford stuff is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.859 
design in my opinion Medford stuff is
kind<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.430> hit<00:02:05.610> or<00:02:05.640> miss<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.149> far<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.479> design

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
kind of hit or miss as far as design

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.460 
kind of hit or miss as far as design
goes<00:02:07.369> but<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.459> Praetorian<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
goes but this Praetorian is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.920 
goes but this Praetorian is

purchase on this dent and the action is
very<00:02:24.549> very<00:02:25.510> stiff<00:02:26.159> which<00:02:27.159> from<00:02:27.370> what<00:02:27.459> I

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
very very stiff which from what I

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.569 
very very stiff which from what I
understand<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> how<00:02:28.299> men<00:02:28.569> furred<00:02:28.840> does<00:02:29.349> it

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
understand is how men furred does it

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.789 
understand is how men furred does it
really<00:02:30.579> tight<00:02:30.849> tolerances<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:32.260> stiff<00:02:32.590> at

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
really tight tolerances really stiff at

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.190 
really tight tolerances really stiff at
first<00:02:32.829> with<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> idea<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.959> they<00:02:34.959> don't<00:02:34.989> be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
first with the idea that they don't be

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
first with the idea that they don't be
broken<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.829> and<00:02:36.040> become<00:02:36.400> nice<00:02:36.879> and<00:02:37.120> smooth<00:02:37.450> in

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
broken in and become nice and smooth in

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.520 
broken in and become nice and smooth in
the<00:02:37.780> future<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.510> left<00:02:40.720> side<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.260> can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the future I can on the left side I can

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.960 
the future I can on the left side I can
open<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.450> with<00:02:43.450> one<00:02:43.599> hand<00:02:43.659> obviously<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.620> just

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
open it with one hand obviously you just

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.030 
open it with one hand obviously you just
watched<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.239> happen<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> think<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:47.799> only<00:02:47.920> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
watched it happen so I think it's only a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.059 
watched it happen so I think it's only a
matter<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.400> time<00:02:48.730> before<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.239> can<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:50.069> on

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
matter of time before I can do it on

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.610 
matter of time before I can do it on
this<00:02:51.790> side<00:02:51.849> and<00:02:52.450> that's<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.049> because<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.409> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
this side and that's just because of the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.339 
this side and that's just because of the
extra<00:02:53.769> pressure<00:02:54.190> I'm<00:02:54.430> putting<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:55.349> lock

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
extra pressure I'm putting on the lock

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.289 
extra pressure I'm putting on the lock
bar<00:02:56.650> I'm<00:02:56.859> sure<00:02:57.099> but<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:59.290> has<00:02:59.650> some<00:03:00.310> really

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
bar I'm sure but this has some really

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.479 
bar I'm sure but this has some really
really<00:03:01.720> nice<00:03:02.049> machining<00:03:02.590> work<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.099> very

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
like I said mr. Medford he likes to send

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.000 
like I said mr. Medford he likes to send
out<00:04:21.709> his<00:04:22.010> knives<00:04:22.420> tight<00:04:23.420> so<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.290> they<00:04:24.530> break

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
out his knives tight so that they break

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.310 
out his knives tight so that they break
in<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.430> become<00:04:25.670> loose<00:04:25.960> instead<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.080> sending

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
in and become loose instead of sending

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.120 
in and become loose instead of sending
them<00:04:27.500> out<00:04:28.150> perfect<00:04:29.150> so<00:04:29.530> when<00:04:30.530> they<00:04:30.620> break<00:04:30.920> in

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
them out perfect so when they break in
