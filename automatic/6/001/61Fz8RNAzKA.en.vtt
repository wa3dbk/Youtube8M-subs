 smudge one must perform cuts of one 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.320
 high accuracy 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.420
 it's a beginner level project that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.420
 will require approximately one hour per door 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.720
 you will find a wide range of 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.540
 door moldings at your home store

 the unity of the scenery first drawn a line

 around the door frame to an eighth of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.239
 bottom thumb so your moldings will be 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.460
 slightly behind the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.469
 door frame adjust the rule is to 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.870
 your square combined with an eighth of 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.430
 inch then press the arm of the east 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.039
 against the baptise door 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.170
 place your pencil against the ruler 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.859
 and draw a line along the uprights 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.859
 and lintel 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.050
 repeat this step for each of the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.120
 three sides of the frame measure the distance 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
 between your two dashes on each side of the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.000
 framework to calculate the length of the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000
 tincks molding 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.079
 this is the head molding above 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.490
 the door and trace the direction of the cut 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.490
 oblique on each side 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.380
 adjust the cutting angle of your if at 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.859
 45 ° tabs makes the cut of the first 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.859
 side 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.460
 replaced the molding by aligning the cup 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.939
 with the intersection point of your 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.520
 pencil 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.409
 at the other end trace a mark 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:04.850
 on the molding before undertaking 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:07.219
 your second cut at 45 ° cloud and the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.640
 upper molding on the door frame 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.980
 use 3d or 4d nails at intervals 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.500
 12 inches on the bottom of the molding and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.040
 csbe 8d nails on the top of the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.510
 molding to prevent cracking 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.579
 avoid planting nails unless you 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.290
 quarter-inch drifts and at less than one 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.840
 inch of the ends of the molding 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.849
 place the vertical molding against the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.630
 built of doors and raced with the help of a 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.769
 pencil the direction of the copa tab 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.660
 measure the distance between the corner 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.360
 inside of the waist molding and the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.950
 ground then cut the vertical molding to 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.950
 a 45 degree angle 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.000
 cloud is now the moldings 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.870
 vertical in the same way that the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.870
 upper molding 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.340
 depressed the nails with a punch 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.959
 to drown the butcher cloud heads 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.579
 the holes using plaster to recap 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.980
 moldings is an element of 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.950
 essential finish that harmonizes 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.989
 with any decor laid 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.989
 moldings that frame well is beautiful 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.580
 here is the list of tools and
