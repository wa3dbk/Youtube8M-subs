only do any damage at all we just trying

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.999 
only do any damage at all we just trying
dodge<00:05:43.009> his<00:05:43.189> attacks<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:44.150> best<00:05:44.389> we<00:05:44.569> can<00:05:45.009> well

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
dodge his attacks the best we can well

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:52.029 
dodge his attacks the best we can well
he's<00:05:46.129> just<00:05:46.159> so<00:05:46.610> fast<00:05:50.289> and<00:05:51.289> he<00:05:51.499> just<00:05:51.770> basically

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
he's just so fast and he just basically

00:05:52.039 --> 00:06:16.690 
he's just so fast and he just basically
and<00:05:53.469> alex's

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.870 

so<00:06:17.420> basically<00:06:17.990> what<00:06:18.350> happens<00:06:18.740> now<00:06:18.980> is<00:06:19.010> we<00:06:19.670> go

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
so basically what happens now is we go

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.000 
so basically what happens now is we go
straight<00:06:20.360> back<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.200> the<00:06:21.410> beginning<00:06:21.530> of<00:06:21.890> the

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
straight back to the beginning of the

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.150 
straight back to the beginning of the
game<00:06:22.160> again<00:06:22.550> how<00:06:22.790> it<00:06:22.970> all<00:06:23.330> began<00:06:23.810> and<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:24.950> goes

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
game again how it all began and it goes

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.540 
game again how it all began and it goes
in<00:06:25.340> a<00:06:25.430> constant<00:06:25.940> cycle<00:06:27.190> because<00:06:28.190> now<00:06:28.370> we<00:06:28.430> have

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
in a constant cycle because now we have

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.720 
in a constant cycle because now we have
23<00:06:29.060> three<00:06:29.720> years<00:06:29.960> later<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.560> that's<00:06:31.520> what

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
23 three years later and that's what

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.700 
23 three years later and that's what
it's<00:06:32.000> our<00:06:32.180> son<00:06:32.540> come<00:06:33.170> to<00:06:33.380> am<00:06:35.050> come<00:06:36.050> to<00:06:36.080> show<00:06:36.560> his

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
it's our son come to am come to show his

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.590 
it's our son come to am come to show his
revenge<00:06:39.550> now<00:06:40.550> the<00:06:40.610> good<00:06:41.060> thing<00:06:41.120> about<00:06:41.360> the

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
revenge now the good thing about the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.230 
revenge now the good thing about the
game<00:06:41.810> is<00:06:42.080> any<00:06:42.380> weapons<00:06:42.950> armor<00:06:43.700> or<00:06:43.910> anything

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
game is any weapons armor or anything

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.510 
game is any weapons armor or anything
else<00:06:44.420> that<00:06:44.540> you've<00:06:44.660> collected<00:06:45.190> during<00:06:46.190> the

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
else that you've collected during the

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:58.050 
else that you've collected during the
previous<00:06:46.790> playthrough<00:06:47.440> you<00:06:48.440> keep<00:06:48.680> this<00:06:48.860> time

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.050 

um<00:06:58.750> yeah<00:06:59.740> so<00:07:00.100> as<00:07:00.310> you<00:07:00.430> can<00:07:00.490> see<00:07:00.639> that<00:07:00.820> now<00:07:01.000> he

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
um yeah so as you can see that now he

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.700 
um yeah so as you can see that now he
says<00:07:01.330> start<00:07:01.660> bloodline<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.380> wear<00:07:02.590> as

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
says start bloodline to wear as

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.710 
says start bloodline to wear as
basically<00:07:03.190> we<00:07:03.520> have<00:07:03.550> to<00:07:03.820> play<00:07:04.000> through<00:07:04.270> whole

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
basically we have to play through whole

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.770 
basically we have to play through whole
game<00:07:04.990> again<00:07:05.639> with<00:07:06.639> pretty<00:07:07.360> much<00:07:07.480> the<00:07:07.540> same

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
game again with pretty much the same

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.340 
game again with pretty much the same
enemies<00:07:08.230> but<00:07:08.500> the<00:07:08.560> all<00:07:08.950> slightly<00:07:10.230> harder<00:07:11.230> to

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
enemies but the all slightly harder to

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.659 
enemies but the all slightly harder to
beat<00:07:11.500> because<00:07:11.650> they've<00:07:11.860> all<00:07:11.980> level<00:07:12.310> look<00:07:12.460> just

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
beat because they've all level look just

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:15.270 
beat because they've all level look just
the<00:07:12.760> same<00:07:12.790> as<00:07:13.060> what<00:07:13.210> we<00:07:13.240> have<00:07:13.590> and<00:07:14.590> and<00:07:15.040> it's

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
the same as what we have and and it's

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.129 
the same as what we have and and it's
like<00:07:15.669> say<00:07:15.820> it's<00:07:15.940> just<00:07:16.090> basically<00:07:16.480> basically<00:07:16.900> a

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
like say it's just basically basically a

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.320 
like say it's just basically basically a
constant<00:07:17.680> cycle<00:07:18.100> until<00:07:18.190> eventually<00:07:18.490> we<00:07:18.940> get

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
constant cycle until eventually we get

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.480 
constant cycle until eventually we get
to<00:07:19.750> a<00:07:19.780> level<00:07:20.020> where<00:07:20.200> we<00:07:20.380> may<00:07:20.800> actually<00:07:20.950> stand<00:07:21.400> a

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
to a level where we may actually stand a

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.020 
to a level where we may actually stand a
chance<00:07:21.520> in<00:07:21.880> defeating<00:07:22.210> him<00:07:22.450> and<00:07:24.030> obviously

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
chance in defeating him and obviously

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.100 
chance in defeating him and obviously
not<00:07:25.150> going<00:07:25.300> to<00:07:25.450> keep<00:07:25.570> playing<00:07:25.690> through<00:07:25.960> it

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
not going to keep playing through it

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.629 
not going to keep playing through it
again<00:07:26.200> but<00:07:26.800> I<00:07:26.860> just<00:07:27.040> wanted<00:07:27.310> to<00:07:27.430> share
