00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 soon it's great how hey hey you are wonderful 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.099
 yes, which hairstyles do you really have to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.630
 practice forever that you have them on it and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.640
 I have to personally in the summer 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.079
 no desire at all but the three 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.969
 hairstyles I have wet today 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.620
 this super sample and each of you 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.210
 can implement them and still see them 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.180
 great and now I wish you 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 a lot of fun with the video for the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.570
 first hairstyle first fights your hair 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.039
 just go through and press the crest 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 you want and then you take 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.300
 already have flowers and it just dies 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.370
 Over the hair over it so that it on the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 and then you sit down 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 each left and right individual 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 hair strands and pulls that through the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 So have you lead after 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.820
 behind and here you can do that very well 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.610
 see and then I have that one 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.860
 bit of rudi hair strand from above 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810
 down and the hair strand down again 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 out that is super simple 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 This really works in two minutes and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 on each side I do that two-to-one 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.189
 three times so that the hair from the front 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 are simply all from the face out 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.780
 thus disturbing one in the summer not so one 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 can still wear the hair open and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.799
 I think that she is so pretty 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.590
 again from the side you see that it 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.060
 looks really great and twirled 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 so its really that real 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.509
 Looked for in the summer for the second 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 Hairstyle you all know your hair all easy 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.200
 once back and then you take 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 your left and grows the hair so after 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.950
 away and not too many hairs 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.229
 you can also great from 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.020
 Just post this page up and 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 as far as possible up this affiche 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 take and then tie together 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 the best for the transparent have the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 there is rossmann and then you turn 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.799
 you just a snail up and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.200
 fix the whole thing with hairpins 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 first fixes the first parts 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.040
 Fix the Drees one more piece 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.360
 here the second part can also 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.459
 with third hair clips take that is 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.739
 just sitting well all day long 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.420
 and then I look at the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.709
 a few pages out there because of me 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.080
 simply finds that still looks 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.150
 casual and on then I like that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.090
 just totally if it is not closed 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.739
 looks and then I came to my hair 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.510
 but still a bit at the end and 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.569
 already the hairstyle is finished 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 and is super upbeat and funky for the 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.450
 summer the third hairstyle is almost a 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.160
 French plait of that I take 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.440
 I still have a tough judgment 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.190
 a 3 h from strict and braid first 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.720
 quite normal 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.060
 the important thing is that they are nice and far 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.590
 The whole thing starts at the beginning 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.360
 is that of itself again at the end of a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.069
 a bit loose and then I take me 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 practically always left and right 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.970
 a strand of hair to my normal 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.370
 hair strand so here you see you take 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.260
 year stand by and lichen normal 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.209
 continue on the other side too 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.190
 again a bunch of hair to that whole 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.599
 requires a bit of exercise but if you are 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.980
 tried that a few times then 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.720
 does that work, I'm still one too 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.340
 bit more concentrated because we see 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.510
 but it does not matter but 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.340
 the whole a bit messy 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.290
 looks like it's supposed to be pretty casual 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.480
 and look easy and again here 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.440
 not closed but rather so yes me 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.480
 but I have the hair quickly 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.940
 braided and have a bit of then 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.620
 out of bed it comes easy it is to 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.870
 In the summer here you can see again 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.510
 it is also a bit around with me 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.890
 jumbled but if you read your time 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.030
 and that makes him calm, he gets it 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.409
 every case 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 in between maybe from time to time 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.409
 combing hair that helps too 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.269
 you can get it back more easily from the 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.269
 take away side and here you still see 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.099
 sometimes the rear view, so to speak, then I take 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.230
 me again a strand of hair to and 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.000
 weaves in the normal ones and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.069
 This will give you a great as well 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.349
 beautiful French braid that looks 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.349
 just really great 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.390
 if you are then reached the bottom 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.010
 just plait the braid normally 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.870
 continue and make yourself a hair rubber 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.099
 downstairs I loose then most of the time 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.290
 He still pigtails then he just sees 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.970
 you can do it more voluminous 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.549
 either so let that too super cute 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.110
 is or you roll the whole thing to such a 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.670
 snail together like me right now 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.170
 do it and put it back 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.720
 hair clips firmly that is then easy 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.060
 again more airy and again 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.799
 Summer looks super cute 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.500
 lasts all day and it almost like that 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.389
 a short hairstyle and I just like 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.320
 the structure of this hairstyle totally 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.750
 with pleasure 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.860
 It looks so relaxed and cute abroad 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.479
 I Opel I usually have a few 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.010
 years out and for me 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.020
 this is the perfect hairstyle 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.760
 if you are for example in the summer 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.490
 or at the lake or simply at one 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.300
 picnic So wherever hair so disturbing 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.949
 nice to be airy and summery 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.930
 I hope you have this video 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.520
 fallen and helped beautiful in the 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.440

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.780
