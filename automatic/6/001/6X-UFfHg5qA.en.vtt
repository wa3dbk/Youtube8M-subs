make<00:05:06.439> sure<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:07.369> you<00:05:07.729> are<00:05:07.939> curling<00:05:08.269> if<00:05:08.539> you

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
make sure that you are curling if you

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.869 
make sure that you are curling if you
chose<00:05:08.959> a<00:05:08.989> curl<00:05:09.289> out<00:05:09.499> that<00:05:10.159> you<00:05:10.309> were<00:05:10.459> pulling

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879

out<00:05:11.089> on<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.389> opposite<00:05:11.779> side<00:05:11.989> you<00:05:12.199> don't<00:05:12.469> want

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:12.679 
out on the opposite side you don't want

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.919 
out on the opposite side you don't want
to<00:05:12.860> keep<00:05:13.309> the<00:05:13.519> curls<00:05:13.759> the<00:05:14.149> same<00:05:14.419> way<00:05:14.629> because

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:14.929 
to keep the curls the same way because

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:17.439

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
then you'll end up with one side out and

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.049 
then you'll end up with one side out and
one<00:05:17.629> side<00:05:17.869> thing<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.889> I<00:05:18.919> chose<00:05:19.339> out<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:19.969> I'm
