fun to play with as you experiment with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.190 
fun to play with as you experiment with
different<00:00:49.440> recipes<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.790> try<00:00:51.540> one<00:00:51.960> grain

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
different recipes you can try one grain

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.299 
different recipes you can try one grain
by<00:00:52.380> itself<00:00:52.790> then<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.059> try<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.480> mixed<00:00:54.780> green

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
by itself then you can try a mixed green

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
by itself then you can try a mixed green
sometimes<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.880> end<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.329> batch

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sometimes if you at the end of a batch

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.210 
sometimes if you at the end of a batch
of<00:00:57.930> rain<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.680> combine<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.100> all

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
of rain you can just combine them all

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.250 
of rain you can just combine them all
together<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.730> I'm<00:00:59.850> doing<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.270> today<00:01:00.450> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
together as I'm doing here today so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.290 
together as I'm doing here today so
basically<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.070> grain<00:01:02.280> goes<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> top<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
basically the grain goes in the top and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.569 
basically the grain goes in the top and
then<00:01:03.450> the<00:01:03.540> lid<00:01:03.690> goes<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.140> you've<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.280> on

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
then the lid goes on you've got your on

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.020 
then the lid goes on you've got your on
switch<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.479> gives<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:08.030> coarser

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
switch here which gives you the coarser

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
switch here which gives you the coarser
or<00:01:09.210> finer<00:01:09.450> grind<00:01:09.810> depending<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.560> like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
or finer grind depending what you like

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.000 
or finer grind depending what you like
and<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.000> goes<00:01:12.210> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.840> bowl<00:01:13.010> underneath

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and it all goes into the bowl underneath

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.170 
and it all goes into the bowl underneath
this<00:01:14.430> has<00:01:14.760> its<00:01:14.940> own<00:01:15.090> lid<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.830> simply

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
this has its own lid so this you simply

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
this has its own lid so this you simply
lift<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> lid<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> flour<00:01:20.070> will

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
lift up the lid and then the flour will

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
lift up the lid and then the flour will
collect<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.190> it's<00:01:23.190> very<00:01:23.250> easy<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
collect in here and it's very easy to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
collect in here and it's very easy to
keep<00:01:23.940> clean<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> regularly<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
keep clean if you use it regularly you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.039 
keep clean if you use it regularly you
just<00:01:25.500> dust<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> off<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.040> put<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> away<00:01:27.049> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
just dust it off and put it away so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.420 
just dust it off and put it away so
everything<00:01:28.409> goes<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.159> bowl

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
everything goes right into this bowl

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.880 
everything goes right into this bowl
there<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.330> just<00:01:30.780> recently<00:01:31.229> new<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> market

there is just recently new on the market

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.490 
there is just recently new on the market
a<00:01:32.250> flour<00:01:32.640> bagger<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.600> belongs<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.350> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
a flour bagger which belongs to this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
a flour bagger which belongs to this
product<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> you'll<00:01:35.820> insert<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> bag<00:01:36.450> inside

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
product and you'll insert the bag inside

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.039 
product and you'll insert the bag inside
and<00:01:37.260> then<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.560> freshly<00:01:38.450> milled<00:01:39.450> flour<00:01:39.750> can

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and then your freshly milled flour can

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
and then your freshly milled flour can
go<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.290> into<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.590> bag<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.520> makes<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
go right into a bag if that makes it

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.460 
go right into a bag if that makes it
really<00:01:42.150> easy<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.600> store<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> freezer

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
really easy to store it in the freezer

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.010 
really easy to store it in the freezer
so<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.970> push<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.840> need

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so here we go we push this in you need

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
so here we go we push this in you need
to<00:01:46.080> push<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.650> way<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.520> when

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to push it all the way in and then when

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
to push it all the way in and then when
you're<00:01:47.820> ready<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.210> simply<00:01:48.630> turn<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.439> your
