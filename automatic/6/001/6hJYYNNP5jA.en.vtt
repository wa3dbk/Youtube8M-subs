00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.260 
we're actively in control so what
actually<00:04:34.289> is<00:04:34.979> directed<00:04:35.430> at<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.759> steering<00:04:36.000> is

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
actually is directed at this steering is

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.839 
actually is directed at this steering is
basically<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.020> worst<00:04:37.650> was<00:04:37.949> still<00:04:38.370> by<00:04:38.550> wire

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
basically the worst was still by wire

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.300 
basically the worst was still by wire
technology<00:04:39.319> basically<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.740> concept<00:04:41.099> is<00:04:41.280> that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
technology basically the concept is that

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.820 
technology basically the concept is that
the<00:04:42.150> steering<00:04:42.419> new<00:04:42.750> movement<00:04:43.259> is

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
the steering new movement is

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.980 
the steering new movement is
electronically<00:04:44.610> transmitted<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.659> road

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
electronically transmitted to the road

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.070 
electronically transmitted to the road
via<00:04:46.620> signals<00:04:47.220> motors<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.419> forth<00:04:48.659> rather

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
via signals motors and so forth rather

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.950 
via signals motors and so forth rather
than<00:04:49.379> a<00:04:49.470> traditional<00:04:49.879> shaft<00:04:50.960> mechanical

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
than a traditional shaft mechanical

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.779 
than a traditional shaft mechanical
system<00:04:52.289> what<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.039> benefits<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.669> the

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
system what is the benefits of the

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.689 
system what is the benefits of the
electronic<00:04:54.360> system<00:04:54.840> more<00:04:55.830> precise<00:04:56.280> steering

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
electronic system more precise steering

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.899 
electronic system more precise steering
view<00:04:57.379> remove<00:04:58.379> the<00:04:58.590> vibrations<00:04:59.310> so<00:04:59.639> it's<00:04:59.789> a

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
view remove the vibrations so it's a

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.110 
view remove the vibrations so it's a
less<00:05:00.210> fatigue<00:05:00.659> and<00:05:01.460> customization<00:05:02.460> in<00:05:02.759> the
