00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
you have to have three of them it's a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.849 
you have to have three of them it's a
fact<00:00:21.390> isn't<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.720> great<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> other<00:00:22.350> us<00:00:22.590> but

your control card on weapons is during

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.490 
your control card on weapons is during
your<00:00:35.670> point<00:00:35.880> string<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:37.020> discard<00:00:37.320> one

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
your point string you can discard one

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.930 
your point string you can discard one
card<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.399> negate<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> activation

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
card and you can negate the activation

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
card and you can negate the activation
of<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> card<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.860> destroy<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.550> means<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
of a card and you destroy this means you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340 
of a card and you destroy this means you
can<00:00:41.969> also<00:00:42.120> negate<00:00:42.390> cards<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.750> already<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
can also negate cards are already on the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
can also negate cards are already on the
field<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.770> they're<00:00:43.860> continuous<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.399> can

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
field so if they're continuous you can

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
field so if they're continuous you can
still<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> perfect<00:00:45.510> well<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.379> like

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
still get it perfect well so it's like

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
still get it perfect well so it's like
your<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:47.129> boost<00:00:47.430> plenty<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> other<00:00:47.789> table

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
your your boost plenty of other table
