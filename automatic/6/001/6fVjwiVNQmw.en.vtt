00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.090
 according to m well 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.080
 it's good we got it 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.669
 I do not think that inadvertently intend to let% 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.869
 because it is there but the result is very exotic yellow card 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.210
 for marc damage and cases it is the touch in the face certainly 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.909
 even if we are very far away 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.909
 it seemed clear here 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089
 and to burn right now it is very disturbing because it is there 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.390
 and many portraits of him at the time who asked for 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
 telegram 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.580
 these principles what happened but obviously these are images that we have 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.580
 absolutely not see 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.340
 for standing apart this is where 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.400
 the rolls lalalalalalalalala this terrible this terrible shock there it's 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.050
 terrible 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.710
 Tuesday the guards then face 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.950
 since that 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.010
 who in addition fell back with his head he does not move more than that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.050
 images 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.150
 poor table on a football field there is no other word 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 look look but faces 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 there are bands of men standing on TV 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.610
 it's the face of george the crates and marc milmo he assured 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.940
 in the silence here in the stadium that is incredible china who is in tears 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.220
 obviously no one is thinking of the pool match for the moment keeping these 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 faces 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.929
 the derby kite is crying 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.019
 for the face structure 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.259
 on the almost invisible horizon
