I'm good to play but nevertheless I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.050 
I'm good to play but nevertheless I
still<00:02:28.010> understand<00:02:29.010> how<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.489> play<00:02:29.760> one

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
still understand how we can play one

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.960 
still understand how we can play one
side<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.959> then<00:02:31.140> well<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.950> mean<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.819> not

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
side to do and then well I mean it's not

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.750 
side to do and then well I mean it's not
that<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.900> example<00:02:34.290> when<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.769> played<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.519> was

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
that for example when I played it was

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.750 
that for example when I played it was
not<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.799> left<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.160> take<00:02:38.340> too<00:02:38.610> many

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
not like we have left to take too many

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.089 
not like we have left to take too many
rough<00:02:39.030> because<00:02:39.239> mostly<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:39.900> didn't<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
rough because mostly we didn't have to

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.319 
rough because mostly we didn't have to
yeah<00:02:41.519> we<00:02:41.879> didn't<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:44.329> everything

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
yeah we didn't have to and so everything

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.270 
yeah we didn't have to and so everything
control<00:02:46.079> them<00:02:46.379> for<00:02:46.650> from<00:02:46.890> out<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.250> fridge

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
control them for from out the fridge

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.530 
control them for from out the fridge
found<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.160> really<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.879> we<00:02:51.000> lost<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.480> many
