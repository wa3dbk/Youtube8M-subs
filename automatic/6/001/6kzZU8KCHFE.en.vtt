00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.400
 video on the channel I take krauser and 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.890
 as always bringing you a new video 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.840
 and well, good people, I bring you a video 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.460
 more plants against zombies gardens 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.869
 warfare and this will be the video of a 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.580
 new series that we are going to be bringing 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.610
 to the channel and it's about the characters 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.260
 specials that this game has you 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.910
 you will know that a few days ago I made a video 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.530
 of opening the sachets and in these 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.780
 sachets I got a character 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.850
 special that basically will be the first 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.280
 that we will use in this great series that was 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.290
 a variation of the scientist of a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.190
 character called the physical and well then 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.769
 in these moments we are going to 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.899
 to spend a game with that character 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.210
 to know what weapons brings what more or 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.190
 less like what variations or what 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.949
 difference has regarding the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.480
 scientific and so good is the next 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.030
 chapters will be opening the envelope 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.159
 seeing what character touches us and leaving us 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.110
 to play with that character without giving us 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.049
 opportunity to prove anything clear the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.729
 physical I have not played it either, so 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.649
 they know new people to be and in the channel and 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.299
 without more to say let's go to the first 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.190
 departure and the following chapters already 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.159
 they will be opening the envelopes and playing 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.789
 with his characters we will see how we 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.789
 goes with the physical 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.710
 and good people now so we 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.270
 we find in the gameplay we are going to 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.020
 choose our first character 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.740
 special that is the physical 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.079
 and let's go 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.000
 let's see how special this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.600
 character of a character variation 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.780
 scientific 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.240
 the bullets are different 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.500
 This little character you used to 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.610
 we are going to recharge hours that we 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 We found someone to tell him 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.690
 in the little flower 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.230
 there's to be quickly downsized my god god 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.190
 mine do not leave anything do not leave anything where 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.080
 there are faults 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.410
 you can follow this soldier in essence 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.920
 not ok ok but not the scientist can not 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.920
 get up there 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.670
 pinche lance inhabitants no mamen no 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.379
 we go that makes fire 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.590
 ok with the skills they should do things 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.590
 different 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 he teleports the same 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.510
 ok if you shoot one like they give to 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.510
 several as electricity passes 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.090
 today runs runs covers you cut 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.590
 pinche scientist no this is the physical 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.010
 gentlemen is the physicist there is no 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.010
 confuse 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.060
 what bad aim do I have 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.940
 ok dead to eat to be put on 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.360
 these three milestones that's why I like to use 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.940
 I upload to the soldier that I want to be that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.040
 character of fire but I do not see what 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.350
 that is different for me that is some 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.350
 skill has unlocked ok 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.720
 we have the same thing to cure 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.570
 we have the same 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.570
 who says he has fire to undo something 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.340
 passion fruit 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.340
 Oh, why are you putting this on? 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.690
 when I felt very similar outside of 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.790
 that when two enemies are very close 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.190
 gentlemen if you shot one like that 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.810
 electricity goes through both 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.810
 he is quite father 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.140
 when they arrive at this little flower of 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.140
 here 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.270
 to the yard son of utility in the 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.130
 impossible that the corner and there were 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.080
 seen with that I tell you everything 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.330
 I had not seen them 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.890
 come on let's go let's be pretty or in 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.490
 the physical character I also like 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.470
 appearance much we want to 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.209
 this 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.480
 but it will help me but it is blessing 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.520
 of the other 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.620
 and no no no skewer and soldier starts to 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.260
 shoot already after they kill me do not 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.800
 it's a little 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.240
 very good this team on your part there is no 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.240
 no one ever stop me 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.160
 that's why the tight better faster 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.729
 we keep wasting time 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.550
 I'm going to try to get closer 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.849
 and where where there are several to see if 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.949
 you can see that effect of that like that 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.949
 it happens to another 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.719
 God also shoots me 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 and they have very few bullets is only bad 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.360
 of this 4 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.170
 whores and failures 3 of the peeled egg 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.170
 first estimate to lift the fucking life 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.919
 I have to learn to use these things 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:21.599
 that I always forget because I believe 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.599
 visualize 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.789
 well to practice it 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.630
 Perez 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.630
 Perez 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.129
 cage will suffice these 2 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.790
 I do not have to end but my aim 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.790
 another of these fruits plants 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.700
 Thank you 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.279
 you revived 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.960
 and among all was for all 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.860
 let's move on 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.860
 Yes now 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:15.069
 no mamas no no no no noo i am falling in 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:19.349
 everything except what I should do fucking 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.349
 minimal good mother carry this mom 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.970
 is that it's not me who should destroy that 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.360
 mother today my team is is like that 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.919
 very well pointed way 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.919
 having won nothing 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.900
 pinches pacts are super bastards 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.810
 nor mothers are we going to appear 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.490
 well we could already see the difference 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.460
 has this physical character apart from the 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.140
 aspect that I really like that ends 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.450
 good click electric users 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.250
 electric equal pass not no I am not very 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.230
 good with the physical and when we touch 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.120
 I do not know any variation with the soldier 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.790
 I hope the temple is one with the 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.200
 soldier or with the carnivorous plant or with 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.580
 the set of peas that are the 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.580
 characters that I use most even the 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.400
 engineer, we can see here a few times 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.290
 taste more this in the character not 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.850
 play characters who seeketh 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.310
 used as is the case of the scientist 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.940
 but well, people lack little to 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.070
 to be able to open our second 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.330
 our second special character well 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.530
 that people did not like it , 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.940
 they said it like careless that has gone 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.260
 very much a comment on what they 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.820
 it seemed I'm not Indian to subscribe to 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.680
 channel if you are not subscribed for more 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.840
 videos of plants against zombies the 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.850
 recipes would leave destruction and bring 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.400
 that if we go to the next one and 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.580
 I hope you enjoy the series that will be 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.580
 very good at diverting the characters here 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.580
 special
