00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 all right 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.040
 hello how are you another month step so 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.020
 today I'm here to tell you which 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.969
 They were my favorite products of the month 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.770
 July makes many many products 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.869
 so I have enough to show you 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.520
 starting with the skin part this month 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.279
 I incorporated into my routine of care 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.740
 nocturnal this is to be a revitalizing 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.509
 with vitamin c from Kumar and Kumar is one 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.269
 brand that I did not know but I found it 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.360
 chance in a pharmacy and says that 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.400
 they are natural cosmetics products this 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.040
 serum promises to prevent and reverse the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.050
 signs of aging and promote 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.060
 collagen formation and recover the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.770
 skin luminosity is a product 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.630
 that surprised me quite leaves the skin 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.480
 very hydrated but the only thing that I do not 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.970
 they like it a lot and its aroma is a scent 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.920
 little weird but that after applied 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.140
 in the skin no longer feels anymore comes with 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.060
 a dropper so I applied about two or 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.040
 three droplets on the whole face even 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.690
 on the eyelids and neck other 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.059
 product that I am using a lot this 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.740
 month is this cream that claims to be for 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.590
 hands but I use it on the whole body 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.479
 is the royal mark look for these the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.580
 pink aromas and I bought it in Brazil 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.300
 although it is English industry and they told me 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.070
 that home 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.200
 in Chinatown in Buenos Aires there 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.000
 so if someone knows more details 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.590
 let me in the comments is 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.080
 great because it has a texture 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.390
 little watery then moisturizes the skin 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.280
 but it does not leave it at all heavy and that 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.670
 I love my favorite base this month 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.080
 was the sum of l'oréal my color is that of 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.050
 3 ow 3 gold and beige is a very good 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.460
 Pharmacy base seems to me highly 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.810
 recommended I will make a review in 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.910
 the blog so they can see better 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.310
 pigmentation coverage duration 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.930
 everything more more in detail but I 'm going 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.000
 advancing that I love has a 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.130
 good coverage is a very good basis 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.610
 moisturizer is not totally matte in 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.500
 the skin 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.050
 on the contrary after a few hours 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.760
 They begin to appear to shine 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.560
 sides of the nose especially me who 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.510
 I have a mixed skin so for 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.730
 prolonging its duration is important and 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.780
 seal it with some volatile powder or 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.830
 Compact or use some pre-base 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.690
 matifying thing to counteract a 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.390
 little this effect in the month of July the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.020
 corrector that manu went beige 2 of 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.730
 medicaid 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.170
 this is a corrector that has very good 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.300
 coverage 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.370
 especially to correct the area of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.590
 dark circles because it has a yellow sub tone 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.959
 then help neutralize the dark circles 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.180
 more violet is great and lasts a 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.830
 montonazo because it takes very little 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.599
 to correct the ojera has good 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.810
 coverage a palette that I have for 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.700
 show them is the naked basics 1 habrán 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.560
 seen in other favorites that always 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.709
 I named the 2 but now I'm using 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.480
 much more I like the tones 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 browns to apply on the entire eyelid 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.680
 this medium this use many lipsticks 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.950
 colorful then I wanted one more eye 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.180
 neutral to balance a bit and those 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.950
 were the two tones I used to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.709
 makeup all over the eyelid as well as 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.690
 I have done now and I used this more 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.940
 dark to make a shaded outline 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.170
 and the claritos to illuminate and when 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.900
 I wanted to give a little shine to the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.549
 eyelid used this shadow of nature that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.519
 it's a long crayon shadow 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.350
 duration and my color is the news 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.180
 I really like to apply alone on everything 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.100
 the eyelid and blur it with your fingers 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.720
 I think it leaves as well as a foam 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.640
 very cute and natural 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.950
 based on the product that I'm most 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.740
 using is this kiko pencil eyeliner 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.960
 my color is 02 is very practical for 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.600
 go defining the form and go correcting 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.270
 failures and then I come with the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.860
 little one on the other side and the combs 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.720
 Besides, this napkin is useful for me 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.940
 blur the strokes a bit and not 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.310
 the mask of the month of 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.480
 July was the same manga glory to me is 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.670
 the washable version in black 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.349
 and if they remember in some other favorite 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.180
 I had mentioned it is a mask that 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.459
 I like it a lot and now how is it 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.930
 ending I was using more is already 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.180
 asking in return so that's why 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.680
 I was using more often is 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.530
 a mask that I like a lot because 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.140
 leaves a good volume at the roots of 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.299
 eyelashes and also helps to lengthen the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.980
 enough this month I'm using bronzer 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.739
 as to give a little warmth to the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.560
 I face and was choosing this mac 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.840
 What is the bronx in powder? My color is 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.430
 mat bronze and I like it a lot because I do not 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.699
 it has no particle of brightness 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.100
 then it is ideal for contouring and this 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.320
 It's good because you can go 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.720
 dosing the intensity and so 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.510
 getting let's say a bit contour 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.610
 more marked or more subtle the blush that 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.260
 like last month was the harmony of 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.820
 mac but I will not show it again 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.949
 because surely they are already tired of 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.020
 listen what I'm going to pass directly to 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.970
 illuminator and I have two to show you 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.949
 first Monday magic of 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.110
 l'oréal is a very liquid illuminator 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.050
 subtle that I apply it before or after 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.060
 the base 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.069
 the effect you want to achieve to those who 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.990
 they really like the illuminator is ideal 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.900
 to be used on a day to day basis because 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.300
 contains particles of brightness leader 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.310
 very notorious but leaves a balloon like this 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.620
 very natural and for those who want a 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.720
 very radiant skin I recommend the soft 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.000
 max seat is already an illuminator 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.409
 a little more intense to me I like this 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.090
 to use it at night it seems to me that 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.419
 for the day is too much because this if 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.460
 already has a little more intense particles 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.770
 but it is very nice those who do not know it 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.990
 they have to know is a champagne tone 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.699
 that suits all skins 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.759
 finally in makeup I have two 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.400
 lipsticks to show them one is 806 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.800
 maybelline plan this is a tone 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.190
 Very nice purple is from the line 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.509
 classic maybelline but it is mate 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.759
 experienced has very good duration and 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.800
 it is beautiful to the lips an ideal tone 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.960
 for the winter and the other is a 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.699
 multifunction product of kiko that serves 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.080
 both for the lips and for 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.770
 cheeks 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.280
 is this heart the tone is the 06 is a 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.990
 incredible red I love is a family 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.150
 of preferred red LEDs is very 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.039
 Sophisticated and very comfortable to use because 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.840
 does not dry lips this month too 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.909
 I have a glaze to show you and it's 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.000
 this one of color loves that is called brown 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.819
 mutant is creamy I bought it in Brazil 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.009
 but this line is achieved here so 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.689
 I will probably find it and under my 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.060
 point of view is one of the best 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.400
 Enamel marks because it's easy 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.620
 access prices are very good and 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.629
 They have a variety of huge colors 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.819
 I particularly like this tone 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.800
 because it is neutral is a brownish gray 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.509
 that combines perfectly with any 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.940
 clothes color what I do have to say 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.430
 is that so that it fits on the nail 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.560
 you have to apply three layers or give a 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.690
 little bit of work but I think it's worth 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.029
 worth passing by random this me 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.789
 I excited in a book to show you and it's 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:38.169
 paper cities of john green is a 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.270
 book that I have to admit that I 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.550
 It cost a lot to finish I liked the 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.790
 start and the end but the whole part 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.460
 of 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.710
 Middle drama is very slow very 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.860
 tiresome always returns to the same 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.690
 then I kind of got bored and left it 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.060
 to read and then I would take it and I would 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.310
 I got bored again until I said no 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.470
 I have to finish and the conclusion is 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.810
 that the book did not love me but I 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.640
 like to read some other book of this 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.170
 author to see if it's the way to 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.980
 write of the author with which I do not 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.930
 I identify or if this book is 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.060
 Particularly good the series that fascinated me 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.130
 last month was the game of thrones I 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.040
 I had seen last year to 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.080
 season 4 and this year it came out at 5 that 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.790
 I had not seen him yet so in 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.680
 less than a week I looked at all the 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.450
 episodes of the last season and I 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.130
 loved it well I hope you have them 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.110
 liked do not hesitate to leave me in the 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.240
 comments any recommendation that
