00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.590 
seriously um I've gotten some comments
about<00:01:58.369> this<00:01:58.640> rooftop<00:02:01.060> basically<00:02:02.060> saying<00:02:02.390> that

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
about this rooftop basically saying that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.340 
about this rooftop basically saying that
I<00:02:03.130> was<00:02:04.130> very<00:02:04.219> lucky<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.060> get<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.509> tactical

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
I was very lucky to get the tactical

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.230 
I was very lucky to get the tactical
nuke<00:02:06.560> with<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.009> intervention<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:08.030> the

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
nuke with the intervention with the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.600 
nuke with the intervention with the
thermal<00:02:08.660> scope<00:02:08.929> then<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.920> probably<00:02:10.250> couldn't

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
thermal scope then I probably couldn't

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.230 
thermal scope then I probably couldn't
do<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.850> again<00:02:11.120> because<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:12.580> rooftop<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:14.030> so

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
do it again because this rooftop is so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600 
do it again because this rooftop is so
far<00:02:14.570> out<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> way

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
far out of the way

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.850 
far out of the way
so<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:18.020> know<00:02:18.170> basically<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.130> was<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.670> got<00:02:19.820> lucky

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860
