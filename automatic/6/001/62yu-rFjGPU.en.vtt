 I was going to get a new video game and 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.740
 this time for mobile he had two of 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.260
 some everything I had a couple of years ago 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.490
 because it was that it came out in 2010 2011 more or 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.020

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.090

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.310
 put in exchange for the last sand 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.290
 once he cited a game of had for 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.060
 mobility with the sand in red has 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.410
 surprised that faces face law 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.940
 of the fighters are pretty good 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.690
 made to be a mobile game is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.760
 very well the game is put to play in us 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.230
 have said not yet seen the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.700
 platforms where you are still going to 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.199
 we can play on all the mobile phones that 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.270
 they may be able to play I presume 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.190
 that can be played in the android of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.350
 new generation type those are the ace a 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.190
 galaxy new ones that are taking out the s3 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.210
 things 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.100
 and in the iphones as is obvious 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.840
 the game that I had as you can see in the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.659
 trailer we can see a hardy jeff that 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.240
 it looks very good it looks 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.650
 we can quite see the movements that 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.159
 to be for a mobile game is 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.750
 very cool to me I would like if I had 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.670
 decent mobile or on my mobile is not that it 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.619
 it calls with wonder but it has 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.460
 liked that to be a mobile game 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.479
 have enough face gestures and so on and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.550
 that you can do enough movements 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.070
 as we have seen on TV we have 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.149
 I was able to see how polish Finns are 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.740
 some movement that can be done 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.479
 supporting on the ropes and so on 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.580
 that is going to be a game with few 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.259
 movements will have more of what we 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.020
 we could wait 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.530
 there are also gestures movements if you see the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.610
 tail bostjan is analyzing the trailer 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.110
 You can see how you can and when you do the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.119
 end and a gesture is made as it takes already 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.770
 I have done the finisher and it has enough 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.720
 good looking I hope you liked it 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.179
 the video in the description I already said 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.209
 I leave it the game is developed 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.580
 for namco and let's hope it's done in 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.130
 some game of had for forgiveness for the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.840

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.709

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.019
 and if it is for a generation then better and 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.030
 with a game of had or with that of the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 of avid weak so much better but 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.510
 good for people who can enjoy 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.670
 I hope I can enjoy this game 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.640
 can play with wrestlers 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.470
 favorites of tapeworm and on the mobile as well 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.370

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.400
