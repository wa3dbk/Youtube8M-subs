hello<00:00:07.160> today<00:00:07.790> I<00:00:07.850> want<00:00:08.120> to<00:00:08.180> talk<00:00:08.360> a<00:00:08.389> little<00:00:08.660> bit

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
hello today I want to talk a little bit

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.820 
hello today I want to talk a little bit
about<00:00:08.900> using<00:00:09.350> bench<00:00:10.160> dogs<00:00:10.519> I<00:00:11.620> think<00:00:12.620> almost

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
about using bench dogs I think almost

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.850 
about using bench dogs I think almost
all<00:00:13.340> commercial<00:00:14.090> benches<00:00:14.719> these<00:00:14.960> days<00:00:15.200> come

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
all commercial benches these days come

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.130 
all commercial benches these days come
with<00:00:16.040> bench<00:00:16.279> dogs

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
with bench dogs

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.240 
with bench dogs
the<00:00:18.140> idea<00:00:18.590> is<00:00:18.910> you<00:00:19.910> insert<00:00:20.360> a<00:00:20.390> dog<00:00:20.980> in<00:00:21.980> the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
the idea is you insert a dog in the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.290 
the idea is you insert a dog in the
bench<00:00:22.489> and<00:00:23.710> then<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:24.829> clamp<00:00:25.130> it<00:00:25.310> up<00:00:25.489> using

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
bench and then you clamp it up using

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.260 
bench and then you clamp it up using
another<00:00:27.079> dog<00:00:29.380> set<00:00:30.380> in<00:00:30.559> the<00:00:30.770> vise<00:00:31.730> at<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.149> end

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
another dog set in the vise at the end

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.680 
another dog set in the vise at the end
of<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.480> bench<00:00:33.489> we<00:00:34.489> can<00:00:34.670> see<00:00:34.910> here<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.239> common

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
of the bench we can see here a common

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.160 
of the bench we can see here a common
problem<00:00:36.820> even<00:00:37.820> if<00:00:37.910> we<00:00:38.059> close<00:00:38.329> this<00:00:38.539> vise<00:00:38.809> right

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
problem even if we close this vise right

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.069 
problem even if we close this vise right
up<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.370> bench<00:00:40.609> dog<00:00:40.940> is<00:00:41.390> not<00:00:41.719> going<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:41.929> touch

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
up the bench dog is not going to touch

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.950 
up the bench dog is not going to touch
the<00:00:42.289> end<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.559> work<00:00:43.329> we<00:00:44.329> do<00:00:44.480> have<00:00:44.690> another

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the end of the work we do have another

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.349 
the end of the work we do have another
hole<00:00:45.289> here<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:48.160> we<00:00:49.160> could<00:00:49.309> clamp<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:49.820> like<00:00:49.999> so

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
hole here and we could clamp it like so

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.869 
hole here and we could clamp it like so
but<00:00:51.170> in<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.410> case<00:00:51.679> we've<00:00:52.039> got<00:00:52.070> no<00:00:52.370> support

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
but in that case we've got no support

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.329 
but in that case we've got no support
under<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.600> work<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.589> once<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.890> work<00:00:55.070> gets

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
under the work and once the work gets

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.049 
under the work and once the work gets
thin<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:56.269> could<00:00:56.480> deflect<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.519> we'll<00:00:58.519> lose<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
thin it could deflect and we'll lose the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.970 
thin it could deflect and we'll lose the
flat<00:00:59.300> surface<00:00:59.839> we<00:00:59.989> try<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.260> prepare<00:01:00.499> with<00:01:00.949> a

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
flat surface we try to prepare with a

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.540 
flat surface we try to prepare with a
plane<00:01:02.019> so<00:01:03.019> we<00:01:03.050> always<00:01:03.499> want<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.739> clamp<00:01:04.010> with

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
plane so we always want to clamp with

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.469 
plane so we always want to clamp with
the<00:01:04.699> work<00:01:04.909> on<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.810> solid<00:01:06.200> bench<00:01:06.439> top

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
the work on the solid bench top

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.639 
the work on the solid bench top
therefore<00:01:08.479> that's<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.780> first<00:01:09.079> stop<00:01:09.320> we<00:01:09.500> can

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
therefore that's the first stop we can

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.450 
therefore that's the first stop we can
use<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.189> we<00:01:10.250> have<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.610> bridge<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.149> gap<00:01:12.460> now

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
use and we have to bridge this gap now

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.749 
use and we have to bridge this gap now
it's<00:01:13.759> useful<00:01:14.710> essential<00:01:15.710> really<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.460> a

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
it's useful essential really to have a

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.569 
it's useful essential really to have a
set<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.240> different<00:01:17.509> spaces<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:19.009> we<00:01:19.130> can<00:01:19.310> use

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
set of different spaces that we can use

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.770 
set of different spaces that we can use
in<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:21.049> end<00:01:21.170> here<00:01:22.390> find<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.630> most

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
in the end here find the most

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.069 
in the end here find the most
appropriate<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:27.110> wind<00:01:27.409> in<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.570> dog<00:01:29.810> in

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
appropriate and then wind in the dog in

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.240 
appropriate and then wind in the dog in
your<00:01:30.710> vise<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:32.930> holds<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.380> work<00:01:33.590> nice<00:01:34.009> and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
your vise that holds the work nice and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.679 
your vise that holds the work nice and
firm<00:01:35.860> but<00:01:36.860> what<00:01:37.070> if<00:01:37.219> you've<00:01:37.430> got<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.759> bench<00:01:38.090> that

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
firm but what if you've got a bench that

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.069 
firm but what if you've got a bench that
doesn't<00:01:39.079> have<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.560> tail<00:01:39.799> vise<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:41.840> fact

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
doesn't have the tail vise and in fact

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.700 
doesn't have the tail vise and in fact
do<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.350> need<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.680> tail<00:01:43.039> wise<00:01:44.409> well<00:01:45.409> it's

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
do you need a tail wise well it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.590 
do you need a tail wise well it's
probably<00:01:45.979> quite<00:01:46.549> convenient<00:01:47.210> if<00:01:47.359> you're

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
probably quite convenient if you're

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.090 
probably quite convenient if you're
going<00:01:47.689> to<00:01:47.780> fold<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.170> but<00:01:48.649> you<00:01:48.740> don't<00:01:48.920> actually

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to fold it but you don't actually

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.679 
going to fold it but you don't actually
need<00:01:49.430> one<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.210> can<00:01:50.420> use<00:01:50.710> wedges<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:52.659> pair<00:01:53.659> of

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
need one you can use wedges a pair of

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.889 
need one you can use wedges a pair of
wedges<00:01:54.700> folding<00:01:55.700> wedges<00:01:56.030> sliding<00:01:56.570> wedges

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
wedges folding wedges sliding wedges

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.459 
wedges folding wedges sliding wedges
there<00:01:57.109> they're<00:01:57.350> known<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:57.820> put<00:01:58.820> together<00:01:59.469> when

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
there they're known as put together when

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.060 
there they're known as put together when
they<00:02:00.649> pass<00:02:01.070> by<00:02:01.100> each<00:02:01.429> other<00:02:02.380> they<00:02:03.380> increase<00:02:03.829> in

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
they pass by each other they increase in

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.779 
they pass by each other they increase in
total<00:02:04.520> width<00:02:04.969> as<00:02:05.710> we<00:02:06.710> push<00:02:07.009> these<00:02:07.250> wedges

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
total width as we push these wedges

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.350 
total width as we push these wedges
against<00:02:08.330> each<00:02:08.479> other<00:02:09.520> hopefully<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.910> can<00:02:11.060> see

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
against each other hopefully you can see

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.479 
against each other hopefully you can see
that<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.590> distance<00:02:13.100> between<00:02:13.750> them<00:02:14.750> here

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
that the distance between them here

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.830 
that the distance between them here
gets<00:02:16.209> wider<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.810> wider<00:02:18.360> narrows<00:02:19.360> when<00:02:19.659> we

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
gets wider and wider narrows when we

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
gets wider and wider narrows when we
part<00:02:20.680> them<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:22.239> we<00:02:22.360> push<00:02:22.569> them<00:02:22.720> together

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
part them and as we push them together

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.050 
part them and as we push them together
it<00:02:24.790> gets<00:02:24.939> wider<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.750> that's<00:02:26.620> what<00:02:26.829> we<00:02:26.980> use<00:02:27.340> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
it gets wider and that's what we use to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.710 
it gets wider and that's what we use to
wedge<00:02:28.269> our<00:02:28.540> work<00:02:28.780> between<00:02:29.739> bench<00:02:30.099> dogs<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:31.629> to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
wedge our work between bench dogs so to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270 
wedge our work between bench dogs so to
work<00:02:31.959> on<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.230> same<00:02:32.379> piece<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.709> work<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.189> we

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
work on the same piece of work when we

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.490 
work on the same piece of work when we
don't<00:02:33.459> have<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.640> tail<00:02:33.939> vise<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:34.989> have<00:02:35.200> bench

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
don't have a tail vise but we have bench

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.750 
don't have a tail vise but we have bench
dog<00:02:35.859> holes<00:02:37.230> place<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.439> work<00:02:38.650> up<00:02:38.950> against<00:02:39.459> one

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.679 

problem<00:03:21.980> that's<00:03:22.129> often<00:03:22.489> encountered<00:03:23.090> when

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
problem that's often encountered when

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.130 
problem that's often encountered when
using<00:03:23.959> bench<00:03:24.319> dogs<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:25.519> we<00:03:25.790> haven't<00:03:26.030> held<00:03:26.390> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
using bench dogs if we haven't held the

using bench dogs if we haven't held the
work<00:03:27.349> from<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.709> bag<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:29.090> unless<00:03:29.359> we're

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
work from the bag is that unless we're

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.979 
work from the bag is that unless we're
working<00:03:31.220> with<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.519> force<00:03:31.879> directly<00:03:32.420> opposing

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
working with a force directly opposing

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.080 
working with a force directly opposing
the<00:03:33.079> bench<00:03:33.260> dog<00:03:33.590> there's<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.340> tendency<00:03:34.879> for<00:03:34.909> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
the bench dog there's a tendency for the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.080 
the bench dog there's a tendency for the
work<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.599> rotate<00:03:36.140> if<00:03:37.069> we've<00:03:37.370> got<00:03:37.519> very<00:03:37.760> narrow

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
work to rotate if we've got very narrow

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.530 
work to rotate if we've got very narrow
work<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:40.700> tends<00:03:41.060> not<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.299> be<00:03:41.450> a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
work like so that tends not to be a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.250 
work like so that tends not to be a
problem<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:42.620> then<00:03:42.769> why<00:03:42.890> do<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.129> go<00:03:44.260> for

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
problem but then why do we go for

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.129 
problem but then why do we go for
example<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:45.859> piece<00:03:48.099> if<00:03:49.099> we<00:03:49.940> plane<00:03:50.239> directly

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
example this piece if we plane directly

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.369 
example this piece if we plane directly
a<00:03:51.170> bench<00:03:51.650> dog<00:03:51.950> that's<00:03:52.879> fine<00:03:53.269> but<00:03:53.959> if<00:03:54.049> we<00:03:54.079> try

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
a bench dog that's fine but if we try

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.839 
a bench dog that's fine but if we try
and<00:03:54.530> cover<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.859> whole<00:03:54.889> width<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.579> board

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
and cover the whole width of the board

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.539 
and cover the whole width of the board
this<00:03:56.750> size<00:03:57.109> will<00:03:57.439> rotate<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:58.189> the<00:03:58.400> one

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
this size will rotate in the one

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.569 
this size will rotate in the one
direction<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.389> on<00:04:00.349> this<00:04:00.530> side<00:04:00.829> we'll<00:04:01.400> rotate

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
direction and on this side we'll rotate

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.940 
direction and on this side we'll rotate
that<00:04:02.030> way

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
that way

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.199 
that way
however<00:04:03.950> by<00:04:04.639> using<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.239> bench<00:04:05.450> dogs<00:04:07.209> an

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
however by using the bench dogs an

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.640 
however by using the bench dogs an
appropriate<00:04:08.810> spacer<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.959> wedge<00:04:12.139> is<00:04:14.650> we

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
appropriate spacer and the wedge is we

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.189 
appropriate spacer and the wedge is we
can<00:04:15.829> hold<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.220> work<00:04:16.430> nice<00:04:16.849> and<00:04:17.120> firm<00:04:17.389> work

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
can hold the work nice and firm work

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:26.200 
can hold the work nice and firm work
right<00:04:19.070> out<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.579> extremes<00:04:25.090> without<00:04:26.090> the
