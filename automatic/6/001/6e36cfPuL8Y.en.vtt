00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.370
 hello everyone how are you good at 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.470
 this video I am going to leave you a series of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 photos now I'm going to talk a little but 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.240
 almost nothing this video is basically for 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.000
 leave you a series of photos of how it was 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.939
 evolving my pink tips according to the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.410
 washed as it is a fantasy dye and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.020
 little by little it is going away with the washings 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 so I think it's interesting to know 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.680
 more or less how long is going how 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 degrading that color and how it's going 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.600
 remaining valid then that I'm going to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.790
 leave photos from the first day that I 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.769
 apply it until the second the third and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.570
 so different washes so you can see 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.309
 how is that color degraded and how is it going 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 losing ok I think it's a video 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 quite interesting because the first 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.160
 day that for example today I finished it 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 of throwing again the first day is very 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.809
 nice and very striking but then it goes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.609
 losing tone and it is important to know 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.489
 because not everything is the beauty of the first 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.039
 day so that's why I leave the video with 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.769
 the photos and you tell me about here 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.769
 Under what do you think and that and those things 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.939
 well this is the degradation of 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.439
 beige color that not only everything 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.079
 it shines and is not always like the first 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.969
 day but I like it so I would 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.740
 I put it back and there is no problem 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.600
 also tell you that there are other colors 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.030
 that degrade to uglier shades by 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.880
 example if you will take the tips 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.700
 blue for example I would degrade a tone 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.100
 greenish blue then green then green 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 mucus like that then yellowish vale 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.479
 it would be a degraded a little bit uglier 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 ok this is degrading to pink lighter 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.739
 and after all within what fits 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.360
 it's not going to be so bad but there are 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.539
 other colors that degrade colors 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.670
 ugly and colors so difficult to 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.349
 carry so nothing whenever you want 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.630
 make you a fantasy dye always have 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.930
 consider this that is going to degrade and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.190
 they need continuous applications and 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.930
 nothing that I hope you have found 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.170
 interesting the video and see you in the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.170
 following
