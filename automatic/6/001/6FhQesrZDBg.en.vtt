extremely large face with our new next
court<00:00:24.090> technology<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:24.779> basically<00:00:25.260> were

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
court technology which basically were

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890 
court technology which basically were
able<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> take<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.760> thin<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.570> areas

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
able to take and thin out the areas

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.390 
able to take and thin out the areas
around<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.260> perimeter<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> picking<00:00:29.310> up

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
around the perimeter of it picking up

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.359 
around the perimeter of it picking up
the<00:00:29.550> inside<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.810> face<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the inside of the face so that it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
the inside of the face so that it
rebounds<00:00:32.940> more<00:00:33.090> uniformly<00:00:33.630> across<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> whole

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
rebounds more uniformly across the whole

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.290 
rebounds more uniformly across the whole
face<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> great<00:00:34.950> new<00:00:35.130> addition<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.270> our

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
face so it's a great new addition to our

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.900

of<00:00:52.559> drag<00:00:52.829> we're<00:00:53.370> putting<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> new<00:00:53.670> straight

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
of drag we're putting a new straight

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
of drag we're putting a new straight
fitting<00:00:54.420> technique<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> from<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> bottoms

Holland<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.030> pulled<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> head

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
Holland we pulled it down of the head

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
Holland we pulled it down of the head
and<00:01:01.199> bond<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> together<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.520> lower<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and bond it together so we're lower in

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
and bond it together so we're lower in
our<00:01:02.850> center<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> gravity<00:01:03.239> we're<00:01:03.719> taking<00:01:04.019> some

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
our center of gravity we're taking some

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
our center of gravity we're taking some
of<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.350> bulk<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.909> objective

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of this bulk out of the the objective

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
of this bulk out of the the objective
the<00:01:06.510> attachment<00:01:07.320> ring<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> making<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.950> much

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the attachment ring and making it much

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
the attachment ring and making it much
more<00:01:08.100> clean<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> playing<00:01:08.970> position<00:01:09.119> which

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
more clean in the playing position which

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
more clean in the playing position which
gives<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.619> clean<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
gives it a really clean look from that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.710 
gives it a really clean look from that
direction<00:01:12.229> we're<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.580> incorporating<00:01:14.720> much

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
direction we're also incorporating much

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.870 
direction we're also incorporating much
of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> same<00:01:16.200> internal<00:01:16.590> dynamics<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.640> order

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of the same internal dynamics in order

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.160 
of the same internal dynamics in order
to<00:01:17.970> heel-toe<00:01:18.330> weight<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.720> club<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to heel-toe weight this club so it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
to heel-toe weight this club so it's
very<00:01:19.439> forgiving<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:19.920> hit<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.250> our<00:01:21.000> new

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
very forgiving when hit also our new

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
very forgiving when hit also our new
straight<00:01:21.390> fit<00:01:21.540> technology<00:01:21.720> allows<00:01:22.290> eight

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
straight fit technology allows eight

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.840 
straight fit technology allows eight
different<00:01:22.920> setting<00:01:23.189> positions<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.700> we've

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
different setting positions now we've

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.149 
different setting positions now we've
had<00:01:24.000> eight<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> past<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> 32<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.860> past

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
had eight in the past and 32 in the past

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
had eight in the past and 32 in the past
but<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> allowing<00:01:27.420> us<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
but what this is allowing us to do is to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.929 
but what this is allowing us to do is to
change<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.560> face<00:01:28.799> angle<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.640> degrees

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
change the face angle up to two degrees

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.219 
change the face angle up to two degrees
plus<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.390> minus<00:01:30.750> open<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.630> close<00:01:33.630> were

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to do all these things opens up a wide

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
to do all these things opens up a wide
range<00:01:39.869> eight<00:01:40.140> settings<00:01:40.650> from<00:01:40.860> left<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> right

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
range eight settings from left to right

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030 
range eight settings from left to right
so<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.909> basically<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.840> club<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.680> going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so you can basically a club that's going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
so you can basically a club that's going
hitting<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> ball<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.670> far<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.450> can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
hitting the ball very far right you can

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
hitting the ball very far right you can
close<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> face<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.350> change<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.799> loft<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
close the face down change your loft and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
close the face down change your loft and
bring<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> ball<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:47.700> into<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> middle<00:01:48.390> same

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
bring the ball back into the middle same

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.450 
bring the ball back into the middle same
thing<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.500> pulling<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> shot<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
thing on there pulling the shot and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.920 
thing on there pulling the shot and
going<00:01:50.670> left<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.570> bring<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> back

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
going left a lot you can bring it back

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.649 
going left a lot you can bring it back
to<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> center<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.670> 25<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.630> know

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to the center so up to about 25 you know

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.300 
to the center so up to about 25 you know
30<00:01:54.990> yards<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> dispersion<00:01:55.799> down<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.219> were

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
30 yards of dispersion down there were

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
30 yards of dispersion down there were
able<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.549> basically<00:01:56.909> bring<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.600> into

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
able to basically bring that back into

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.270 
able to basically bring that back into
the<00:01:57.990> middle<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> fairway<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the middle of the fairway for the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560 
the middle of the fairway for the
average<00:01:59.399> golfer<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.509> very

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
average golfer and so it's a it's a very

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.319 
average golfer and so it's a it's a very
great<00:02:01.759> adjustment<00:02:02.759> method<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> allows

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
great adjustment method it allows

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.030 
great adjustment method it allows
average<00:02:04.110> golfers<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.710> able<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
average golfers to be able to get the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.160 
average golfers to be able to get the
kind<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.479> customization<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.960> we've<00:02:07.079> only

went to a hundred different drivers to

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.530 
went to a hundred different drivers to
find<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.939> one<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.239> was<00:02:11.299> the<00:02:11.390> right

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
find the one that was the right

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.449 
find the one that was the right
combination<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:12.110> them<00:02:12.379> we're<00:02:12.950> now<00:02:13.099> able<00:02:13.280> to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
combination for them we're now able to

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.550 
combination for them we're now able to
take<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:13.970> club<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.599> have<00:02:14.930> eight<00:02:15.140> different

settings which allows each golfer to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.390 
settings which allows each golfer to
find<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.390> exact<00:02:17.720> right<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.829> set<00:02:19.099> up<00:02:19.220> which

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
find the exact right that set up which

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.130 
find the exact right that set up which
allows<00:02:19.430> them<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.939> have<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.360> best<00:02:20.750> possibility

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
allows them to have the best possibility

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.350 
allows them to have the best possibility
of<00:02:21.379> hitting<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> fairway<00:02:22.280> our<00:02:22.879> stock<00:02:23.090> shaft

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
of hitting the fairway our stock shaft

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.500 
of hitting the fairway our stock shaft
is<00:02:23.689> a<00:02:23.720> variable<00:02:24.349> lofts<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.799> fukui<00:02:25.510> which

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
is a variable lofts of fukui which

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.800 
is a variable lofts of fukui which
allows<00:02:26.840> us<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.790> use<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.819> new<00:02:29.090> technology<00:02:29.690> called

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
allows us to use a new technology called

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.360 
allows us to use a new technology called
ninja<00:02:30.110> quartz<00:02:30.590> basically<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.340> very

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
ninja quartz basically it's a very

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.490 
ninja quartz basically it's a very
increased<00:02:32.329> hoop<00:02:32.599> strength<00:02:32.930> which<00:02:33.110> allows<00:02:33.379> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
increased hoop strength which allows the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.190 
increased hoop strength which allows the
club<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.670> flex<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.269> shaft<00:02:35.569> without<00:02:35.989> going

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
club to flex and the shaft without going

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.530 
club to flex and the shaft without going
flat<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.620> one<00:02:36.650> side<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:37.519> shaft<00:02:38.060> needs<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.420> be

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
flat on one side a shaft needs to be

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.449 
flat on one side a shaft needs to be
able<00:02:38.629> to<00:02:38.750> bend<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.680> store<00:02:39.890> energy<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.370> a

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
able to bend and store energy in a

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.180 
able to bend and store energy in a
circular<00:02:41.109> cylindrical<00:02:42.109> fashion<00:02:42.799> if<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.069> goes

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
circular cylindrical fashion if it goes

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.490 
circular cylindrical fashion if it goes
flat<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.909> tends<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.239> unload<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.290> non<00:02:45.470> uniform

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
flat it tends to unload in a non uniform

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.229 
flat it tends to unload in a non uniform
way<00:02:46.129> so<00:02:46.190> we're<00:02:46.400> basically<00:02:46.519> able<00:02:46.879> to<00:02:47.060> take<00:02:47.209> a

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
way so we're basically able to take a

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
way so we're basically able to take a
very<00:02:47.540> very<00:02:47.720> lightweight<00:02:47.870> shaft<00:02:48.290> incorporated

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
very very lightweight shaft incorporated

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800 
very very lightweight shaft incorporated
with<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.489> head<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.879> order<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.120> achieve<00:02:50.629> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
with this head in order to achieve the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.390 
with this head in order to achieve the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you know maximum potential forgiveness

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.920 
you know maximum potential forgiveness
for<00:02:52.609> average<00:02:52.879> golfers<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.389> better<00:02:53.599> golfers

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
for average golfers and better golfers

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.170 
for average golfers and better golfers
to
