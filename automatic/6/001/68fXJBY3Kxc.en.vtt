 main the main focus of therapy 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.850
 will be to patients who are perhaps 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.450

 chemotherapy and then what are we going to 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.810
 to learn is to project our own 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.729
 energy to the patient therefore to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.429
 our chip has to be cultivated to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.649
 top of those 10 cultivation levels of the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.420
