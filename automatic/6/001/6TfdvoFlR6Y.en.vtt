just<00:01:09.090> give<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> twist<00:01:09.539> and<00:01:09.780> two<00:01:10.110> clockwise

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
just give it a twist and two clockwise

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.529 
just give it a twist and two clockwise
because<00:01:11.160> that<00:01:11.369> we're<00:01:11.640> looking<00:01:11.729> upside<00:01:12.240> down

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
because that we're looking upside down

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.420

into the hole if you definitely what

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.680 
into the hole if you definitely what
they<00:03:23.110> are<00:03:23.320> that's<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.680> okay<00:03:24.270> keep<00:03:25.270> that<00:03:25.480> log

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
they are that's in okay keep that log

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.710 
they are that's in okay keep that log
that

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.600 

gently<00:03:31.830> little<00:03:32.830> bit<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.040> pressure<00:03:33.370> off<00:03:33.460> that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
gently little bit of pressure off that

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.760 
gently little bit of pressure off that
lever<00:03:34.060> making<00:03:34.630> surely<00:03:35.020> still<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.470> lighting

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
lever making surely still like lighting

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
lever making surely still like lighting
and<00:03:36.730> then<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.200> fiddle<00:03:38.470> around<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:39.070> bit

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
and then we have to fiddle around a bit

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.860 
and then we have to fiddle around a bit
to<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.660> upon<00:03:40.960> that<00:03:41.230> whole<00:03:41.560> go<00:03:41.980> simply<00:03:42.600> they<00:03:43.600> do

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
to the upon that whole go simply they do

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.550 
to the upon that whole go simply they do
going<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:45.220> never<00:03:45.460> cook<00:03:45.700> without<00:03:45.880> bolts<00:03:46.390> in

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.660 

reassembling<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.710> bottom<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.040> leg<00:03:55.530> there

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
reassembling the bottom of the leg there

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.220 
reassembling the bottom of the leg there
so<00:03:57.670> much<00:03:57.970> now<00:03:58.210> it<00:03:58.360> can<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.660> sometimes<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
so much now it can be a sometimes it

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.040 
so much now it can be a sometimes it
almost<00:03:59.790> feels<00:04:00.790> as<00:04:00.940> if<00:04:01.090> it's<00:04:01.270> impossible<00:04:01.900> to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
almost feels as if it's impossible to

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.650 
almost feels as if it's impossible to
get<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.320> back<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.940> have<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.180> get<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> torch

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
get it back in you have to get a torch

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.810 
get it back in you have to get a torch
and<00:04:04.900> look<00:04:05.050> up<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.830> leg<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.280> convince<00:04:06.700> yourself

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
and look up the leg to convince yourself

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.360 
and look up the leg to convince yourself
and<00:04:07.300> there<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.660> fact<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.959> whole<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:20.210 

eventually<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:16.810> will<00:04:16.840> drop<00:04:17.200> into<00:04:17.410> price<00:04:17.739> but

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.430 

there<00:04:21.220> can<00:04:21.430> be<00:04:21.459> very<00:04:21.820> awkward<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.420> anything

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:36.760 

they<00:04:26.440> will<00:04:26.680> drop<00:04:26.890> in

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.990 

just<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.889> get<00:04:38.039> things<00:04:38.720> had<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.870> right<00:04:41.000> shaping

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
just to get things had the right shaping

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.070 
just to get things had the right shaping
back<00:04:42.240> in<00:04:42.419> there<00:04:47.840> yeah

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.210 

and<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:56.360> split<00:04:57.360> pin<00:04:57.599> back<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.050> place<00:04:58.319> the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.059 
and the split pin back in place the
split<00:04:59.520> pin<00:04:59.699> back<00:04:59.909> in<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.690> actually<00:05:01.620> put

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
split pin back in and actually put

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.520 
split pin back in and actually put
through<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.430> Farquhar<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.379> you<00:05:04.379> could

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
through the Farquhar that you could

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.879 
through the Farquhar that you could
avoid<00:05:04.800> flat<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.819> here<00:05:06.150> your<00:05:07.110> short<00:05:07.440> block<00:05:07.650> them
