00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello girls here we are for an update 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.360
 of my phone apps 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.160
 I repeat is a samsung galaxy core and has 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.330
 wanted to redo this video because I have 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.450
 added a lot of other apps 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 which he wanted to share with you 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.480
 so then in the meantime the screen that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.430
 we find this is therefore a background 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 let's say black with pink roses and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:34.260
 nothing I put the pin that you can 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.399
 seeing is a very thing then this is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 background 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.649
 take with the sea we go directly 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.340
 to the applications downloaded then 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.570
 we have facebook that by now is not 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.610
 a novelty for anyone 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.050
 then we have tumblr which is an application 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.980
 let's say where we share photo phrases and 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.750
 so much more that this is precisely the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.060
 screen that you are in, etc. 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.990
 etc 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 then we have chatham that is 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320
 application 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.869
 where precisely you can let the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 music that is suffering in that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:24.390
 moment it is he then recognizes we sail 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:29.520
 instagram which is an application where you 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.740
 they put photos and I like them a lot 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.740
 so my personal is this one 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.600
 priscilla palozzi is instead that of the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.720
 channel I'll leave it below in the info box 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:51.000
 then we have simple mp3 downloader which 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.080
 is used to download music and I can 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.830
 ok to put on the fire 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.030
 then we have viber we have passed 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.250
 we have and liam which is an application 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.110
 where you can edit photos 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:18.090
 now I take a photo as a guinea pig then 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:20.880
 we take this gallery 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.620
 here it is certainly in black and white 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.989
 We also still have carla 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:33.150
 all effects and possible 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:35.459
 imaginable and now and save and then there is 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.070
 the option to be able to do it directly 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.370
 share somewhere 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.000
 then we have what we have buses 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.040
 roma which is an application where precisely 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.780
 tells him if you put the code on 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.940
 stop tells you what cars are 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.269
 arriving what cars pass for that one 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.640
 stop and above all how much 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.239
 time yet you have to wait let's say then 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.640
 there is and the translator which is practically a 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.230
 translator very simply then 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.670
 we have the staff that is an application 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.889
 connected instagram that makes you see 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.260
 the people who follow you the people you 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.000
 they don't follow you but you follow them 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.630
 people who unfollow you go to all 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.630
 these things 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.180
 I'm not saying it's useful because in the end 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.550
 sti cavoli who is who does not follow us however 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.020
 oh well to have something more if 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.440
 maybe it could be loaded today even on Valentine's Day 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.930
 then this is the page you are on 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.050
 precisely what you see those you have 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.810
 blocked the ones you have we say the 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.940
 latest followers and here are the ones who 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:51.350
 you lost between little ones so that there 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 they still have vacuum but then we have 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.250
 we have we have the antivirus is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.690
 true says the word itself then we have 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.980
 corner texts that is what's up 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.110
 internet only that put like 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.030
 application then we skype that all 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.920
 you know we have candy room that is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.020
 an application similar to the tree cai 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.980
 opel astra saras between advice then goes 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.950
 all the effects are good 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.550
 directly then we have what it is 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.209
 an application for couples e 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.620
 I advise you to download it and try it 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.970
 without that I'll show you why 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.530
 however there are personal things 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.020
 obviously palmesino boy and then 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.930
 we have tax for life that you all know 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.940
 I think an application where it gives you based 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.010
 to the categories you choose to tag 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.810
 appropriate to put on the description 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.200
 of your image on instagram 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:44.600
 then we have 2048 game now strafamoso 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.660
 which is that thing you have to type 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.620
 put the two with 2 the 4 with 48 with 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.320
 lot but you have to put 16 with 16 32 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:02.590
 etc. etc. end to arrive at 2048 e 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:07.250
 I succeeded then we have ds kokam 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.260
 which is an application where you can 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.750
 put the effects to the photos 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.300
 so a little similar aim but boh to me 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.960
 like this we have more cropping 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.220
 square 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.960
 this is where you practically put it 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.360
 your image and he already puts you i 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.700
 white edges for instagram without 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.130
 you need to have it cut or 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.720
 things like that so it's very much 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.030
 helpful 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.500
 then we have weather the application is ok 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.200
 of the weather 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.280
 then we have mister flaps which is a game 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.510
 where that is a real manhole now vi 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.510
 I show briefly a 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.050
 where, precisely, to pass them through the spaces 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.110
 whites, however, is a serious manhole 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.420
 oh well I will never succeed anyway it is a 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.550
 great pastime we say and then we have 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.930
 peak lord matic always an application 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.270
 to change the marching photos of the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.830
 too cool effects 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.900
 then we have pops that is 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.260
 an application similar to ebay 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.490
 and you can find me with the name of 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.440
 main or priscilla post not me 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.410
 I remember dancing priscilla palo anyway 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.290
 then we then have laimbeer and chandan e 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.770
 zara that we are just saying stores 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.140
 favorite 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.910
 then we go in to know everyone 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.560
 where are all the funny videos 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.640
 etc. etc. 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.280
 however most are in English 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.150
 so see you 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.450
 then i never got that kind of with a dow 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.180
 it is an I put it for mine 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.650
 birthday 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:50.120
 in fact the happy birthday to belong site 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:53.430
 ee are missing 19 days then 6 June 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.710
 then we have pixart which is an application 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.810
 where you fear where you can put the edges where 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.760
 you can put a picture will also add 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.380
 maybe another image above then 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.810
 create a kind of two-way effect 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.500
 pictures so it was very pretty in there 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.470
 like a lot 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.720
 then we have where it is convenient 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.390
 an application where you put where you are and 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.190
 he tells you all the shops or the dancing on 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.220
 restaurant that you are around so 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.810
 let's say that 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.360
 if for example it goes to a place that doesn't 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.340
 he knows he goes to a bar without it 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.260
 ask put where it is convenient put the 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.850
 city ​​etcetera 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.070
 then there is we work it which is an application 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.840
 where there are all images but I think 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.510
 you all know now it's not a secret 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.710
 more for no one 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.480
 I think there are a lot of images 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.190
 very well that you will never find on 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.910
 google images because they are too much 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.280
 details then we have as last 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.140
 twitter application 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.540
 and aside from changing all the graphics 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.490
 in fact I stayed a little longer 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.710
 nice to say but I'm not used to it 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.630
 however on all the time to find me 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.770
 with the name and the iii stones indent 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.600
 bass 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.690
 anyway all the release links always 

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.190
 below in the info box and no guys 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.440
 at least this was my update 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.120
 I hope I have been useful to you maybe 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.130
 you have known some new ones 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.840
