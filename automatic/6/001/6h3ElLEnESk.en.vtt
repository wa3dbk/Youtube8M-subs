00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.169
 Welcome and thank you for joining us in the series 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.010
 Begin Education Career in Papeete I'm Gamepad OK and though I am 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.579
 As I know, on the screen I have a Hyundai IX bedding games 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.300
 admit that I am nobody 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.020
 and that's why I invited the dog expert Martin Dehli for tips 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 This will make you like her puppy Fitz for the company 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.250
 Habermas hang out thank you so much that they came, I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 his 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.890
 Do you know how his little friend here is called Rodeo the time as a puppy is the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.899
 ideal time to start socialization or introduce families 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.010
 sometimes say 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.580
 do what you have to do first to properly socialize a puppy 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.230
 what about that starts with the moment you turn it to the first one 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.080
 sometimes hits 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.000
 You get to know a puppy and if you are not careful, you feel overwhelmed 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.670
 you take overloaded 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 we do not want to overload our senses so we try calmly 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.240
 to stay we stay the dog against koeln one collects immediately if 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.500
 then you come home Basta also here I do not want to overload them 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.479
 I prefer to show them a new face after another a new experience 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.370
 after another 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.640
 Familiarize them so how long do I have to wait for the kids to clear the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.080
 Family reunion with the course depends on the world market I believe this one here 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 We could go with you almost immediately but I would say if you ask him 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.730
 gradually introduced to the family 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.450
 that after a few weeks he will get to know the world and they will come along 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.760
 tell her dog what she accepts 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.990
 and then you know 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.100
 when he is ready for the world how exactly 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.070
 bring their dog together with different people differently dressed it 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.990
 will surprise her 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.560
 in sight certain things affect a dog pay attention to it a bit 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.000
 Lena these first three months in the life of the small rodeo of a small dog 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.510
 are like a Sozia Zion Spa ASE and if that goes wrong 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.170
 can, however, shape the whole life against the Belgian over the principles of the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.130
 Internets us with other dogs 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.110
 somehow you do that right before you find answers there is someone 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.949
 so that too should listen 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.809
 i want to introduce you to little foxi's do not pick the hello 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:29.089
 Forks easy street one more sweet I see she is Angela one that is very 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.590
 Well 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.010
 only by a light leash when the two dogs meet I have them 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.230
 quite happy alone Karl Focke that is probably eHow I like it if the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.000
 Freedom of movement I would prefer if everyone has his place 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.969
 his place you do not know 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.999
 because then they do not have to defend and can sniff each other 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.819
 they start communicating about the smell so a relaxed rest becomes the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.930
 Atmosphere we have so far can get along quite well i have yours 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.070
 Question that everyone has ever asked 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.280
 this feeling for the back part and why do they do that? 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.060
 both of us do not do it but usually we do not mean what 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.429
 the 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.469
 I think this is like a fingerprint moment I have none 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.939
 Fingerprints my butt 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.090
 I hope so 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.590
 al i believe the reason recognizes by it an individual recognizing the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.950
 Character of the defect dealers recognize the character of another dog 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.459
 how the other is and what if they can not stand what we do 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.949
 then 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.549
 Now one of the things you always have to watch out for is the body language of the body 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.119
 Dog if I would like to see this little one here rather relaxed and the 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.979
 Being here in front of the city I like what has to be taken care of 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.999
 if that's his stick when it's exactly what happens 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.829
 a bit the unapproachable easier 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.459
 she said Stock interested no more than 2 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.859
 yes that's right so stay calm and you can if you want your dog 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.629
 in May move something to say a different position then put Dirk 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.530
 plays where the Jews and neighbors 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.540
 and Rolly Royce Tat is about understanding their body language 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.610
 realize what's going to happen and put them in one position the one 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.510
 like and if my dog ​​is the aggressive Jasper Forks Julia is not 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.959
 the case will be but what do you do not do any case 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.959
 then I would cancel their friendship 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:14.209
 Gorka APA Oct in this way you sometimes lose hope 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.340
 Becker is right there and we always want to support friendship and each other 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.580
 or you just want the customers to be known on Friday but it's true 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.830
 some dogs are just a bit more aggressive than others 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.710
 and these two we need not worry about Dr but if they are more aggressive 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.870
 Then pay attention to their body language to make sure they are up to something 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.360
 stiffen open the book go up 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.419
 Things that show us October "I'm not sure I would 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.599
 say APA and put it back in place like this 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.340
 higher than possible give it totally okay 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.419
 they can make friends, but they are not allowed to each other 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.260
 attacking is not allowed to attack each other, what they do not need 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
 only when they steal something from the plate do I say ARA 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.599
 Exactly next time I know that 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.379
 if you are lucky enough to have 100 park nearby then what is the last one? 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.939
 Child never good for socialization 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.289
 I find dog surgeries a great thing as long as the other dogs too 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.729
 socialized let's say so much luck 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.250
 I like it when the dog experiences different things and with an under par 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.469
 that matters 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:19.499
 Dr 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.180
 so introduce it slowly and walk around with it around it 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.150
 let him pollute the environment " 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.800
 No let them go in. They never came with them again and again 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.610
 They then enter the park on a leash. "When he feels well 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.370
 Seems to make sure that your dog is not so nervous too nervous 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.790
 Dr and I too must calmly and confidently commit bankruptcy 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.529
 One where easy on the dog 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.110
 that was it we come to our 5 4 Köll over stars 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.219
 about which to this action of which is pleased 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.219
 1 Bring your puppy with other dogs in the first three months 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.149
 win together, of course, the slowly commanded seems to feel quite good 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.669
 two kindergartens with different people together the more people in the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.279
 Signs are numbered Mentalist 3i uses BP over others 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.759
 Dogs off with it so they do not pick up a big one and they just pick it up 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.889
 out of the situation, they sent in fitness also pirates show them 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.189
 Patience with her broom is pure shyness he is going to be facing now 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.649
 to be shy but that does not mean we are not at the end of the meeting 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:26.889
 be comfortable 5 unplanned should have nice experiences with other dogs 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.439
 but there were the dogs in the eye which is a problem 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.059
 could 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:35.340
 Sophie is high after the talk about social isolation I feel like 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:40.180
 For a walk year, Nick Diaz provided okay until next time at the
