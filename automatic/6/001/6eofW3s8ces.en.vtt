00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.700
 and that king 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.940
 minecraft and today I bring you a curiosity 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.020
 very curious every Thursday is worth so 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 Today I'll show cave itself 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.790
 Gentlemen today I mention the caverns 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.510
 the different types of caverns that there are 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.760
 and the best you know some kind that does not 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.190
 have you ever seen or any other 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.309
 little thing so let's go to it first 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.450
 place we have the size caverns 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.240
 small voucher are a small blade 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.850
 that there can only be coal and metal 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.700
 exposed and that reach very high altitudes 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.380
 high or are they staying at a height 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.810
 very high and nothing the truth gives more roll 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.300
 of all and tell you that there can only be 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.020
 metal and coal in the medium caverns 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.410
 there may be metal coal cataracts of 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.690
 water and the truth goes much more towards 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.399
 inside there is also usually a lot of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.860
 amount of mold and you are going to excuse me 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.450
 because I'm going to put some torches 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.570
 There are usually a lot of mods and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.380
 also, also 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.950
 find gold and lapis lazuli too 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.060
 there may be little dan jones 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.729
 connected and they usually have many 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.160
 branches so how do you see there 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.500
 I just found gold last 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.990
 we would have the big chains that are 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.410
 as the name says quite larger 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.200
 that the previous ones generate lakes of 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.590
 lava or water lava are usually 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.270
 generate the height 11 is worth and there is a great 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.820
 quantity of precious materials 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.560
 exposed the basics like coal the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.310
 metal too and we can find gold 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.320
 we can also find diamond 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.570
 lapis lazuli good remains very many 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.820
 materials and for example here we had 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.700
 the diamond after seeing the three 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.040
 basic types of caves we can observe 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.239
 that this is something we have not seen 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.390
 previously 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.140
 this is an offering of the earth called 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.840
 rafting vale 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.210
 and are often generated with soil from 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.090
 wash 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.460
 most of the time fall cataracts 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.110
 of water or lava and the truth is that there 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.650
 a burrada to keep exposed in addition 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.540
 if we are at the extremes and we put them 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.340
 many times to find in food and 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.850
 also if we are lucky and there is a 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.700
 good height 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.670
 for example the 11 we could have luck 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.740
 and find diamond the next one is the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.690
 tics cliff which means quantity or 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.270
 deep and the truth is that it is an honor 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.300
 tremendous down is a kind of 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.420
 pretty cool cavern since it's a 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.580
 hole as I tell you tremendous that we 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.560
 leads to a good depth and 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.190
 many times because they can be 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.680
 linked to various medium-level routes or 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.510
 small even sometimes big so 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.060
 very cool 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.710
 these to amount of the deep ones and 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.770
 probably guys this is yours 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.860
 favorite and these are the entries 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.970
 giants that are called die in 30 and good 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.300
 they are holes in the surface that you 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.240
 lead to a cave complex of one 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.130
 enormous magnitude is also worth you can 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.020
 find something routines in between and the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.510
 they are truly impressive 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.750
 look how it looks from the surface or 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.080
 it is a hole of a meteorite it is worth 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.080
 then nothing other cooler guy besides 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.990
 here we are already next to a racing 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.230
 how interesting and here we have another guy 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.110
 of caverns a really curious since 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.390
 they are called circular rooms and really 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.330
 they are a circle many times the room 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.580
 trace found itching down and 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.260
 you will have seen having the metal or any 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.840
 thing that may appear in height 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.530
 they can also appear on the surface 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.960
 and it would be something like that the truth is 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.850
 strangers are really curious and nothing 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.740
 is another type of cave more and the last 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.680
 type of cavern that I am going to comment 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.720
 are the epic epic caves that are 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.780
 really huge and they have more 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.060
 odds of appearing to be created in 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.860
 the good ocean can be generated in 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.969
 any biome but there are more quantities 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.629
 in the ocean they are really huge they are 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:55.319
 grottos in huge look from here there is a 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:57.659
 circular room and connecting with 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.799
 many other areas for example here 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:05.249
 there is a rapid and they are huge for example 

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:08.069
 here is the top part more more 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:10.649
 awesome so guys I hope that 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.129
 I have loved the curiosity very 

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:15.959
 curious of the caverns and now you see 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.689
 you know all types of caverns 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.219
 that you are even some experts 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.009
 cavers so I hope that I have 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.889
 liked 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.319
 This other 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.319
 you set the optical effect of the spiral 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.360
 how cool
