00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
was like $30 or so I've seen a lot of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
was like $30 or so I've seen a lot of
other<00:00:41.969> places<00:00:42.829> mentioned<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.280> had

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
other places mentioned that they had

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
other places mentioned that they had
this<00:00:44.879> wig<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.289> little<00:00:46.530> more

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this wig and it's a little more

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
this wig and it's a little more
expensive<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.789> expensive<00:00:48.270> style<00:00:48.420> faux

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
expensive on my expensive style faux

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
expensive on my expensive style faux
synthetic<00:00:49.320> units<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.829> guess<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
synthetic units I guess is because of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.389 
synthetic units I guess is because of
the<00:00:50.670> color<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.690> yeah<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.350> able<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> find<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the color but yeah I was able to find it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.100 
the color but yeah I was able to find it
for<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.699> half<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.210> price<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.989> was

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
for like half the price I think it was

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
for like half the price I think it was
like<00:00:55.260> $30<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.129> quote<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.000> know

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
like $30 so don't quote me but I know

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.979

that<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.600> much<00:00:58.199> cheaper<00:00:59.010> than<00:00:59.489> I<00:01:00.390> saw<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that it was much cheaper than I saw in a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
that it was much cheaper than I saw in a

that the only thing that kind of bugs me

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340 
that the only thing that kind of bugs me
out<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.090> said<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
out like I said is that it has like a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.340 
out like I said is that it has like a
wannabe<00:01:40.680> silk<00:01:41.310> top<00:01:41.579> thing<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:43.200> it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
not even like brown I guess it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
not even like brown I guess it's
supposed<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.939> lighter<00:01:47.939> complexion

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210

supposed to be for a lighter complexion
or<00:01:48.840> something<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.320> maybe<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> would

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
or something like that maybe it would

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.080 
or something like that maybe it would
work<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.350> weird<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.790> this
