00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.620
 that's it escanetio guys who drive 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 simulator for you come bring this game 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.130
 that a challenge already fixes on these 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 very very complicated curves of did 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.570
 even for a normal car 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.699
 here you just saw there and I go 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.580
 have to do with a cart with a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.859
 simple carriage is still good, because 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.890
 it would be much more complicated to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 see playing now started today 27 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 June 27 today in the first video only 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 who are now showing there is serious 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 It all worked out right now to record 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.460
 and then they will be able to follow it is 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.989
 champion and turning a steering wheel and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 main game is a very beautiful game 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.180
 also has a very beautiful scenery and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 as you can perceive and it is now I 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.030
 'm and is different from the first video I 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.329
 I take not using 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 it's the manual gear now it 's not final 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.199
 so Flemish is now no longer 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.379
 using the automatic gearbox now you 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.239
 using the manual gearbox that is now 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.790
 I learned how you 're doing there to change. 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:13.040
 right then why did that truck him? 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.570
 It has 12 gears and is and exchange detec 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.240
 Day 27 out of 6 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.799
 So it would be kind of complicated, I'm just 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.060
 the first six marches did not 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.220
 would have more to gain 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.220
 only that the game has a system that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.820
 you are you can choose between the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.390
 the gearbox 1 and 2 is the gearbox 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.119
 of exchange one she would be from the first Friday 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.990
 You will also be normal and go from the 1st. 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.240
 3rd 4th 5th and 6th and there has been the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.479
 second gearbox that marks 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.500
 ranging from the seventh to the twelfth 12th 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.929
 with 67 8ª 9ª 10ª 11ª 12ª and to change 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.350
 this time limit of a gearbox for the 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.819
 The other you are you just have to press one 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.500
 button that has to pass that car 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:03.950
 very noisy very nice because it is 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.540
 because in these moments of election this is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.730
 with two but we will vote the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.520
 subject matter 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.040
 that's when you have a button that you 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.990
 push to change is box box 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.700
 running program 2 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.280
 and then you champion of the first session 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.320
 normal there you push the button there 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.510
 the first exchange rate becomes the seventh 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.270
 in the game and there goes the second happens 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.980
 to be the eighth, the third to become ninth 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.140
 and that way you will understand 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.750
 and I know him, push the button to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.760
 these marches in the game 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.200
 marching box for ax house 2 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.540
 but I was talking to my friend 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.940
 My July and he sends these things 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.670
 they gave me the explanation 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.040
 is about how this is the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.570
 question of trucks and says that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.360
 simultaneous you do not stay on your own 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.240
 exchange if you tighten thus the exchange of the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.630
 of a box box smaller than 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.220
 them to the normal gear box and the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.010
 game is eating having a lot 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.410
 difficulty in this part because it was 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.560
 really the hardest part of trl 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:11.350
 and I won some is one of the punishments for 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.970
 an accident and you lose points and 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.970
 only it is in sight and we have to see also 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.520
 A very beautiful party and I ended up 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.100
 bumping it folks I beat naná wheel 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.380
 pebble there pebble I say type 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.040
 a stone kind of like tons there 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.150
 there the heart by collision there is that was there 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.209
 I asked for a lot because I think it 's 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.709
 also what this infraction in some 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.040
 but I continued very very firm very much 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.510
 strong and beautiful that that was the part 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.150
 even more complicated was a province 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.319
 well closed was exactly right 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.840
 there is put the whole truck there 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.050
 then I was pulling the other and it's very 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.420
 complicated sometimes only you 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.069
 I'm used to the car but you know. 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.200
 Think says the life of the trucker who is 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.080
 sometimes have to face this kind of 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.940
 situation is not and but it is also a thing 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.580
 very exciting is you to do so is 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.410
 a very difficult thing and in a week 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.510
 at least I can make it happen 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.040
 for all these curves 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.239
 Of course you had those incidents like this. 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.299
 but but okay and then continuing it 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.979
 It's very beautiful, my truck is more lonely. 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.720
 which unfortunately only because there was even 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:27.470
 only got this game truck is it is a 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.660
 I do not know anything else, just like that. 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.340
 see what will spread scania yes is one thing 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.680
 very wide a thing a game well 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.260
 very simple has a good game theme well 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.960
 simple deliveries are very simple and 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.640
 who this theme of the challenges is that 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.400
 You can see but it is not a 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.160
 thing is very dynamic and with 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.650
 offer complex as the game tite used the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.620
 software is a much broader game than 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.450
 Do you know how it goes to my hotel? 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.220
 You can do this kind of thing many times over. 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.650
 thing like that is quite a thing 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.840
 game do not deliver them they are very short 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.640
 so you make a delivery in two 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.440
 miles out of 23 that range from 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.740
 delivery understood is a good thing 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.820
 exploited but the strong point of the game is 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.790
 what are you seeing there is only these challenges 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.490
 is with them and testing their skills 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.670
 same and only very difficult thing to do 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.340
 only one is one of the challenges is a challenge until 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.530
 Easy we have very complicated but 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.340
 thankfully I got through the day 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.680
 Let's say beauty, I finished. 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.120
 Beauty, I'll do it, yes, ponzi, I could. 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.120
 do I get scoring only I 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.920
 I lost points of the reflections and then 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.330
 some replay moments you are 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.400
 Seeing there was carrying this thing that 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.310
 your name now how does she who 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.070
 record videos if you forget everything but everything 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.330
 well the step on the curve and see how I 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.050
 I have to open out a lot 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.610
 curve for his career in the bay he does not 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.130
 bottom of the curve 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.990
 the expansion perceived the scenario that 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.110
 they taught the game very cute staff 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.130
 already closed in the artistic part and then it is 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.900
 That's it, folks, it's not working. 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.100
 in the river by subscribing to the 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.800
 channel security to see more videos 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.330
 of skateboarding in the last reader is e 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.980
 also all the videos and even the shift 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.630
 battlefield 3 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.050
 So that's what people said and a 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.050
 big hug
