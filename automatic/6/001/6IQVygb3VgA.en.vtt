00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:14.749 
little small holes there and then you

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.719 
little small holes there and then you
got<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.020> speaker<00:06:15.409> holes<00:06:15.979> there<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.550> cool

got the speaker holes there the cool
thing<00:06:16.759> about<00:06:16.909> the<00:06:17.210> shape<00:06:17.479> of<00:06:17.659> this<00:06:17.779> thing<00:06:18.020> in

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
thing about the shape of this thing in

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.330
