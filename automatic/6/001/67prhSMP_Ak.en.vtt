00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.049
 hi to all segregated friends we get 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.910
 found today on bo two 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.650
 blackhawks 2 i just got it 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 so you see it's not my 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.730
 first game and it's a game of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 commented gameplay 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:28.710
 after so already i'll tell you my 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 class so I play with the 870 mc the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.859
 r8 170th knows who is the first rifle to 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 pump 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.670
 so you 'll see it's a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 massacre 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.920
 but it was hot like embers 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.290
 damage so you'll see beauf I 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.579
 do not go explain in detail 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.500
 the gameplay but you'll see I'm going 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.309
 do a lot of that he's already played in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.199
 which double so yeah so the rv870 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 so it's a shotgun 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.550
 peculiarity is that it has a lot of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.469
 damage one to two bullets or three bullets 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.739
 but maxi as age has just made a 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.350
 hit marker unad a two or right 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 maximum ball 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.260
 he has a good reach me I loved him with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 heavy cannon I think I put in econe 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.500
 to heavy guns and after I do not know 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 that at the touch I mean at the end of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.600
 video because you play I will you 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 show my class at the end of the video 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.520
 so yeah so I'm going to make a big 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.470
 massacre 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.270
 so what I advise you guys 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.220
 my little tactic for this shotgun 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 it is to go free what is to say 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.299
 me me you will watch 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.829
 I'm waiting a little frozen mostly bypasses 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.689
 well there I was camping a little I was waiting for it 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.790
 a bit I waited for it to happen double to 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.680
 pomegranate what I advise you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 it's really going around the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.430
 map 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.479
 it's really going around the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.460
 map with here is the big triple to do 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.630
 the tour of the map with the shotgun 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 like that you get around them you 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.240
 get in the back and this shotgun 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.799
 we're on the map plaza I think 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.219
 it's called like that it's all 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.960
 first map where I did where I played at 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.390
 bo2 i did not want to save my 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.130
 first part why because 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.960
 how to say I felt more than 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.750
 I preferred to offer you a big one 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.489
 massacre well commented you explain my 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.720
 class and everything rather than the arrival of a 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.790
 baby in bo2 and make a live from my 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.300
 first part so that's where you see 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.519
 the level 22 mathorel so that they 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.400
 besides see that I have a lot of 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.410
 luck anyway but but I do 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.030
 say I'm doing well I actually 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.050
 did not know because usually I 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.780
 take the m17 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.220
 the mpc which is a very good weapon I 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.910
 did not know what to take as a rifle to 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.470
 pump and I thought why not 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.940
 take the first I saw he had 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.340
 a lot of damage so I thought he 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.440
 must be good and b actually he 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.200
 turned out that he was very well 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.209
 shotgun 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.450
 I will test and that's it for this map 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.459
 Plaza is really perfect 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.160
 it's really the best shotgun 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.370
 for me in this hand plaza he is he 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.069
 is very very practical and everything after 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.120
 it's my opinion guys again 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.600
 you think what you want but 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.790
 that's my opinion that's all I can 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.380
 to tell you is that for me it's one 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.959
 the best shotguns in this game 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.090
 no picture there is nothing to say 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.310
 and for me it's one of the best 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.040
 pump guns of this game that's for sure and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.420
 certain 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.620
 after you see that I put some 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.959
 stun grenades and that's it 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.489
 lightning then will in fact it's 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.810
 many you choose several 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.030
 targets it's like bombardment of 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.170
 accuracy and makes you a massacre there 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.840
 I did a double I just did 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.190
 still a double does a massacre 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.310
 really have to put it in the spawn 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.440
 enemies there I stay on a beautiful 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.120
 series anyway so why did I put 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.250
 strategic role because I had a 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.720
 little trouble and I was coming out of some 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.730
 quite difficult so I put myself 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.130
 will put dronne big bed and parcels and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.160
 lightning and it turned out very 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.109
 to be a very very good part of it 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.670
 proved to be very effective me I you 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.290
 advise to put these kesri that if 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.730
 you start good I do not hurt 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.489
 of assistance anyway a game you 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.450
 confess I had a good team too 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.250
 very very strong 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.950
 I think that there are really very 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.959
 very good player on beyond a game 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.970
 I for now I tend when I play 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.859
 with paws I fall I fall on 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.500
 big players but when I play everything 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.430
 only I really so on building them 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.980
 a small impex player an experienced 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.180
 see a lot of lightning 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.850
 after what i can tell you about lamah 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.800
 plaza is that there is a staircase 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.930
 central is actually there are two sides there 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.060
 there is the casino side with games and from where 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.560
 well- styled music and there is the side 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.419
 right with lots of buildings 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.950
 restaurants so I advise you to 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.200
 to go from one side or the other but 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.010
 especially try to not pass 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.139
 middle it's really paramount of dad 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.820
 it's in the middle there you see I've 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.360
 recovered an on board machine parcel there I 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.550
 do not go 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.960
 I saw the guy who killed me I got 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.610
 said well I'm going to use this more 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.110
 board machine so for massines 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.030
 must you have death machine with 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.950
 the normal bullets and you have machine 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.680
 of death with also the grenade launcher 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.930
 could they be a grenade launcher in 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.310
 made 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.320
 see that I really get around them 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.120
 dirty it turns out very very effective 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.669
 especially with the shotgun 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.010
 so I think I 'm not sure but I 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.550
 think my strengths are for weight 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.520
 light cold blood and what's its name 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.000
 light weights cold blood and conditions 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.889
 extreme 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.990
 so why not both light weights 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.630
 100 times that cold blood conditions 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.070
 extreme forgiveness so light weight already 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.340
 because that way I can run 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.930
 longer longer do faster and 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.280
 extreme conditions also it's 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.340
 add and cold blood for that I 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.190
 goes below then as long as I 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.750
 do not make me killed by dragons of 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.400
 fire which are the little flying objects 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.010
 there you can shoot with 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.800
 submachine guns the submachine gun that ensures 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.389
 our dragon fire that I do not care 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.520
 play by helicos things like 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.870
 that's really it turns out very 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.620
 effective because you could 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.510
 run a long time 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.400
 that is, if you want to hunt 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.070
 someone you are almost sure of 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.419
 having him catch up with him 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.979
 after you go unnoticed ie 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:13.340
 that you are like a good ghost you 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:15.199
 see there 34 5 6 82 ratio 4 to 6 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.840
 in this really big massacre I had 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.910
 three or four crazy human rights 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.510
 it's really a very very big a big 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.630
 massacre 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.910
 so here it's just a video like that 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.560
 massacre you to tell you for yourself 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.120
 talk about the gameplay but I will do a 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.860
 video my first impressions but 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.810
 I'm still waiting 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.080
 I'm still waiting for a moment 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.460
 say how to say a week or two 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.000
 weeks before I do my first 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.639
 impressions 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.570
 so here I am going to show you my class 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:47.300
 So you see that this is the r ace 870 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.700
 mcs with long barrel researchers 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.680
 quick searchers after conditions 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.960
 extreme grenade this is the base 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.520
 guys it was glorious regin thanks 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.520
