00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.790 
and the same lse as addicting forms is
you<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.040> over<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:07.440> we're<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:07.709> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
you one over here so now we're going to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.620 
you one over here so now we're going to
call<00:03:08.040> we're<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> call<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> phone<00:03:09.090> we're

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
call we're going to call the phone we're

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.420 
call we're going to call the phone we're
going<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.810> try<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.380> summon<00:03:10.920> call<00:03:11.130> again

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
going to try to do a summon call again

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.009 
going to try to do a summon call again
and<00:03:12.270> we'll<00:03:12.780> call<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:14.750> ready<00:03:15.750> three<00:03:16.709> two<00:03:17.720> one

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
and we'll call for ready three two one

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.680 
and we'll call for ready three two one
let's<00:03:19.500> go

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.520 

and<00:03:23.780> five<00:03:24.770> seconds<00:03:25.220> aboard<00:03:26.110> we<00:03:27.110> had<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> slight

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and five seconds aboard we had a slight

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.310 
and five seconds aboard we had a slight
rank<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.270> we're<00:03:29.270> looking<00:03:29.540> at<00:03:29.690> an<00:03:29.990> immediate

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
rank and we're looking at an immediate

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.720 
rank and we're looking at an immediate
assignment<00:03:30.500> time<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:32.470> 189<00:03:33.730> milliseconds

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
assignment time of 189 milliseconds

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.100 
assignment time of 189 milliseconds
which<00:03:35.240> is<00:03:35.270> pretty<00:03:36.110> much<00:03:36.290> where<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.680> median<00:03:37.090> is

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
which is pretty much where the median is

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.250 
which is pretty much where the median is
written<00:03:39.110> for<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:40.250> same<00:03:40.550> power<00:03:40.760> test<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.600> with

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
written for the same power test so with

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.230 
written for the same power test so with
this<00:03:42.530> reading<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.550> tells<00:03:43.730> us<00:03:43.880> it's<00:03:44.090> very

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
this reading it tells us it's very

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.040 
this reading it tells us it's very
likely<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.110> we<00:03:45.260> are<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> same<00:03:46.130> tower<00:03:46.400> as

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
likely that we are on the same tower as

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:57.900 
likely that we are on the same tower as
the<00:03:48.100> UM<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:49.520> our<00:03:49.880> victim

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.930 

so<00:03:58.570> we<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.380> antenna<00:03:59.650> here<00:03:59.890> pointed<00:04:00.250> over

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
so we have the antenna here pointed over

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.540 
so we have the antenna here pointed over
to<00:04:01.240> in<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.170> direction<00:04:02.320> out<00:04:03.160> there<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
to in this direction out there the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.670 
to in this direction out there the
parking<00:04:03.910> lot<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.330> blue<00:04:04.720> car<00:04:05.020> where<00:04:05.380> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
parking lot is a blue car where the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.150

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
victims phone is and this antenna is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.480 
victims phone is and this antenna is
pointed<00:04:09.550> towards<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.210> tower<00:04:10.480> where<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
pointed towards this tower where the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.310 
pointed towards this tower where the
phone<00:04:12.490> on<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.880> in<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.360> blue<00:04:13.510> car<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.750> camped

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320
