00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you have two of the same size here

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
you have two of the same size here
shorter<00:00:58.500> lengths<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.340> long

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
shorter lengths and you have one long

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.790 
shorter lengths and you have one long
bolt<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> can't<00:01:00.809> mix<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.199> got<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
bolt so you can't mix those up got to be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
bolt so you can't mix those up got to be
careful<00:01:02.090> then<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.329> two<00:01:03.390> hoses

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
careful then you have these two hoses
here<00:01:04.229> you've<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> bottom<00:01:05.100> hose<00:01:05.460> then

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
here you've got the bottom hose then

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
here you've got the bottom hose then
you've<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> top<00:01:06.659> hose<00:01:06.900> those<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.920> be

minutes to install this new part which

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
minutes to install this new part which
was<00:01:14.549> super<00:01:15.000> easy<00:01:15.119> usually<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
was super easy usually it's not that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
was super easy usually it's not that
easy<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> work<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.130> anything<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> was

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
easy to work on anything but I was

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
easy to work on anything but I was
really<00:01:19.229> surprised<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.830> how<00:01:19.860> fast<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> got<00:01:20.460> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
really surprised at how fast it got this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
really surprised at how fast it got this
in<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.720> here's<00:01:21.930> old<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.680> is

in and out so here's old one this is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.670 
in and out so here's old one this is
probably<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.340> definitely<00:01:23.610> factory

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
probably this is definitely factory

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
probably this is definitely factory

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
as you can see there it's all nice and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.920 
as you can see there it's all nice and
new<00:01:59.250> looks<00:02:00.250> very<00:02:00.490> clean<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:01.600> reason<00:02:01.870> I've

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
new looks very clean the reason I've

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.110 
new looks very clean the reason I've
been<00:02:01.990> replacing<00:02:02.620> this<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.890> because<00:02:03.280> I've<00:02:03.970> been

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
been replacing this is because I've been

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.870 
been replacing this is because I've been
having<00:02:04.360> some<00:02:04.570> idle<00:02:05.080> surging<00:02:05.650> problems<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
having some idle surging problems and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.040 
having some idle surging problems and
especially<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.510> road<00:02:07.660> have<00:02:07.840> already

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
especially on the road have already

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.430 
especially on the road have already
replaced<00:02:08.200> my<00:02:08.410> fuel<00:02:08.679> filter<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.220> few<00:02:10.000> times

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
replaced my fuel filter a few times

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.750 
replaced my fuel filter a few times
actually<00:02:11.440> twice<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.920> thought<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.640> was<00:02:12.730> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
actually twice I thought that was a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.400 
actually twice I thought that was a
problem<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.209> did<00:02:13.360> go<00:02:13.510> away<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
problem and did go away and the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830 
problem and did go away and the
temperature<00:02:14.920> changed<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.520> course<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.090> we

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
temperature changed of course and we

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.740 
temperature changed of course and we
kind<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.290> went<00:02:17.680> back<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.890> surging<00:02:18.750> but

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
kind of went back to surging but

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.510 
kind of went back to surging but
hopefully<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.350> fixes<00:02:20.770> my<00:02:21.100> highway

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
hopefully this fixes my highway

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.980 
hopefully this fixes my highway

that this one with the white cap I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.740 
that this one with the white cap I
replaced<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.489> as<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.970> white<00:02:34.239> label<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.720> it

replaced that as a white label on it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.260 
replaced that as a white label on it
that<00:02:35.160> didn't<00:02:36.160> really<00:02:36.280> give<00:02:36.520> me<00:02:36.550> much<00:02:36.640> change<00:02:37.120> a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
that didn't really give me much change a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.910 
that didn't really give me much change a
little<00:02:37.390> bit<00:02:37.630> definitely<00:02:38.290> made<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> little<00:02:38.800> bit

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
little bit definitely made a little bit

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860 
little bit definitely made a little bit
because<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.220> OEM<00:02:39.880> one<00:02:40.000> was<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.330> course<00:02:40.510> very

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
because that OEM one was of course very

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.280 
because that OEM one was of course very
very<00:02:41.110> filthy<00:02:41.590> messed<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.660> hopefully

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
very filthy messed up but hopefully

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.140 
very filthy messed up but hopefully
after<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.860> test<00:02:45.100> for<00:02:45.310> my<00:02:45.520> surgery<00:02:45.910> problems

at stop lights will disappear and I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910 
at stop lights will disappear and I
