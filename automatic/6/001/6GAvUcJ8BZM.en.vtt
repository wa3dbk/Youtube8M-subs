00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.270 
we aren't actually gonna flick through
this<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.680> kind<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> job<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this because that's kind of a job to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189 
this because that's kind of a job to
tell<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> works<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.109> if

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
you need a little bit help on the front
end<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.449> worth<00:01:03.629> noting<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> right<00:01:04.350> there

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
end it's worth noting that right there

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
end it's worth noting that right there
you<00:01:04.619> saw<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> hit<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> button<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> took<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you saw I hit the button it took just a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
you saw I hit the button it took just a
second<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.450> game<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> laggy

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
second this game can be kind of laggy

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.649 
second this game can be kind of laggy
occasionally<00:01:08.400> which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
occasionally which is a bit of a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
occasionally which is a bit of a
downside<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.979> big<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.400> deal

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
downside but not that big of a deal

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
downside but not that big of a deal
breaker<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.630> frequent

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
breaker because it's not that frequent

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
breaker because it's not that frequent
and<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.860> usually<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> bad<00:01:14.700> there's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and it's usually not that bad there's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.030 
and it's usually not that bad there's
also<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.720> eye<00:01:15.900> button<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> little

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
also an eye button here to get a little

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.929 
also an eye button here to get a little
bit<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.310> information<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:17.820> the

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.809 
lane there we would have liked to seen a
joystick<00:02:48.799> control<00:02:49.189> then<00:02:49.430> again<00:02:49.670> the

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
joystick control then again the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.520 
joystick control then again the
accelerometer<00:02:50.450> controls<00:02:50.810> here<00:02:51.049> are<00:02:51.260> pretty

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
accelerometer controls here are pretty

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.589 
accelerometer controls here are pretty
excellent<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.700> had<00:02:52.790> no<00:02:52.879> complaints<00:02:53.150> with<00:02:53.419> them

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
excellent we had no complaints with them

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.750 
excellent we had no complaints with them
they<00:02:53.720> worked<00:02:53.900> excellently<00:02:54.260> though<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.519> guess

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
they worked excellently though I guess

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.069 
they worked excellently though I guess
the<00:02:55.849> calibration<00:02:56.329> might<00:02:56.480> have<00:02:56.599> been<00:02:56.720> nice<00:02:56.840> but

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
the calibration might have been nice but

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.390 
the calibration might have been nice but
then<00:02:57.230> again<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:57.500> can't<00:02:57.799> have<00:02:57.919> everything<00:02:58.159> and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
then again you can't have everything and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.979 
then again you can't have everything and
we<00:02:58.489> didn't<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.819> any<00:02:59.030> issues<00:02:59.329> with<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.569> really

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
we didn't have any issues with it really

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.750 
we didn't have any issues with it really
it's<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.560> sort<00:03:00.799> of<00:03:00.859> an<00:03:00.980> aesthetic<00:03:01.310> thing

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
it's just sort of an aesthetic thing

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.580 
it's just sort of an aesthetic thing
that's<00:03:02.540> how<00:03:02.659> this<00:03:02.750> game<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:02.959> controlled<00:03:03.470> in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
that's how this game is controlled in

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.990 
that's how this game is controlled in
this<00:03:03.829> mode<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.069> idea<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.609> stay<00:03:04.819> in<00:03:04.909> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
this mode the idea is to stay in the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.640 
this mode the idea is to stay in the
lane<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.419> then<00:03:05.510> beat<00:03:06.049> your<00:03:06.260> opponent<00:03:06.560> which

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
lane and then beat your opponent which

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.869 
lane and then beat your opponent which
