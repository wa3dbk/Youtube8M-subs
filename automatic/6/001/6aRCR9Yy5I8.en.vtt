00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay so I'm going to try and help you
figure<00:00:05.580> out<00:00:05.730> how<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.970> replicate<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.660> intro<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
figure out how to replicate the intro to

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.240 
figure out how to replicate the intro to
sweetheart<00:00:07.980> by<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> closure<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.849> moscow<00:00:10.250> first

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
sweetheart by a closure in moscow first

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.189 
sweetheart by a closure in moscow first
off<00:00:11.519> we've<00:00:11.940> got<00:00:11.969> delay<00:00:12.480> set<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:14.089> just

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
off we've got delay set here to just

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.599 
off we've got delay set here to just
quarter<00:00:16.199> notes<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.619> guess<00:00:16.800> quarter<00:00:17.340> eighth

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
quarter notes I guess quarter eighth

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.029 
quarter notes I guess quarter eighth
whatever<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.150> would<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.859> tap

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
whatever this would be but just tap

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.370 
whatever this would be but just tap
tempo<00:00:20.279> without<00:00:20.930> and<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> sound

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
tempo without and it's going to sound

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.040 
tempo without and it's going to sound
like<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:29.150> that's<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> goal<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.869> there's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
like this that's the goal so there's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.900 
like this that's the goal so there's
your<00:00:31.109> delay<00:00:32.210> next<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:34.910> some

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
your delay next we want to have some

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.780 
your delay next we want to have some
reverb<00:00:36.239> set<00:00:36.570> I've<00:00:37.469> got<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> Hall

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
reverb set I've got it here on a Hall

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.330 
reverb set I've got it here on a Hall
reverb<00:00:39.090> setting<00:00:39.660> free<00:00:40.559> thick<00:00:40.890> reverb

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
reverb setting free thick reverb

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
reverb setting free thick reverb
actually<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> think<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.510> reverb<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:43.110> come

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
actually I think the reverb should come

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.190 
actually I think the reverb should come
before<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:44.700> delay<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.690> replicate<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
before the delay that to replicate the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.590 
before the delay that to replicate the
sound<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> they've<00:00:46.739> got<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.340> them

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
sound that they've got on the how them

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
sound that they've got on the how them
but<00:00:48.739> it'll<00:00:49.739> work<00:00:49.770> anywhere<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> chain

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
but it'll work anywhere in the chain

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 
but it'll work anywhere in the chain
next<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> some<00:00:52.829> sort<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> pitch

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
next you just want a some sort of pitch

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760 
next you just want a some sort of pitch
shifter<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.449> mostly<00:00:54.989> dry<00:00:55.199> signal<00:00:55.440> but

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
shifter you want mostly dry signal but

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.770 
shifter you want mostly dry signal but
you<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.850> octave

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you want to have a little bit of octave

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.439 
you want to have a little bit of octave
up<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.469> hear<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.180> dry<00:01:00.180> signal<00:01:02.449> now

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
up so you can hear the dry signal now

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.710 
up so you can hear the dry signal now
here's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> pitch<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:05.030> that's<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.360> octave

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
here's a pitch up that's just an octave

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.399 
here's a pitch up that's just an octave
up<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:08.030> it's<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.150> sound<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> like

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:52.219 

so<00:01:14.070> I'll<00:01:14.399> play<00:01:15.179> song<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:16.079> with<00:01:16.499> the<00:01:16.619> song

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.580 

okay<00:01:53.229> next<00:01:54.150> for<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.330> part<00:01:56.020> just<00:01:56.200> after<00:01:56.470> the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
okay next for the part just after the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.190 
okay next for the part just after the
intro<00:01:56.950> you're<00:01:57.220> going<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.400> want<00:01:57.580> some<00:01:57.700> game<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
intro you're going to want some game and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.350 
intro you're going to want some game and
that's<00:01:59.290> pretty<00:01:59.530> much<00:01:59.650> about<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:00.700> let's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
that's pretty much about it so let's

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:26.410 
that's pretty much about it so let's
play<00:02:01.630> along<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.110> part

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.450 

Oh
