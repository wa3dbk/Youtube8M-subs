Scala<00:00:36.930> over<00:00:37.380> Sun<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.100> there's<00:00:38.310> two

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
Scala over Sun so I think there's two

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
Scala over Sun so I think there's two
things<00:00:38.460> first<00:00:38.880> of<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.690> number<00:00:39.990> one

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
things first of all the number one

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.370 
things first of all the number one
reason<00:00:40.650> today<00:00:41.130> when<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.510> somebody<00:00:42.900> choosing

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
reason today when for somebody choosing

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.430 
reason today when for somebody choosing
a<00:00:43.440> car<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.090> exterior<00:00:45.090> design<00:00:45.540> we<00:00:46.410> see

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a car is the exterior design we see

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
a car is the exterior design we see
people<00:00:47.010> buy<00:00:47.310> with<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> eye<00:00:47.790> that's<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
people buy with that eye that's the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.870 
people buy with that eye that's the
number<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.870> reason<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
number one reason so this is a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.670 
number one reason so this is a
good-looking<00:00:51.390> car<00:00:51.420> according<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> me<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.560> one

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
good-looking car according to me is one

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110 
good-looking car according to me is one
of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> best-looking<00:00:53.280> cars<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> segment

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
of the best-looking cars in the segment

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.090 
of the best-looking cars in the segment
so<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> principle<00:00:55.290> reason<00:00:55.890> why<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so that's the principle reason why I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
so that's the principle reason why I
think<00:00:56.430> people<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:57.030> come<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
think people will come to look at the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
think people will come to look at the
car<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.770> once<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.610> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
car then once they come and look at the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.370 
car then once they come and look at the
car<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.420> come<00:01:00.570> inside<00:01:00.870> you'll<00:01:01.110> see<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
car they come inside you'll see that

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.080 
car they come inside you'll see that
it's<00:01:01.530> given<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> higher<00:01:02.190> level<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.670> features<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's given a higher level of features a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.139 
it's given a higher level of features a
higher<00:01:03.420> level<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> equipment<00:01:04.110> inside<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
higher level of equipment inside and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.670 
higher level of equipment inside and
then<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.329> third<00:01:06.509> reason<00:01:06.719> they'll<00:01:06.990> buy<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> my

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
then the third reason they'll buy and my

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
then the third reason they'll buy and my
opinion<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.190> because<00:01:08.400> only<00:01:08.520> driver<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:09.210> will

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
opinion is because only driver they will

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
opinion is because only driver they will
