let me ask you do you miss wavedashing
well<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.449> probably<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.929> closest<00:00:04.500> thing

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
well this is probably the closest thing

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.160 
well this is probably the closest thing
to<00:00:04.920> it<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.370> smash<00:00:05.730> 4<00:00:05.759> I'm<00:00:06.569> going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.870> tell<00:00:07.049> you

guys everything about perfect pivoting
how<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.950> used<00:00:11.160> in

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
how to do it and how it can be used in

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.610 
how to do it and how it can be used in
battle<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:12.179> inputs<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:12.929> technique<00:00:13.349> are

battle the inputs for this technique are
pretty<00:00:14.040> straightforward<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
pretty straightforward all you have to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.439 
pretty straightforward all you have to
do<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.139> -<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.830> direction<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.910> instantly

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
do is - in one direction then instantly

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
do is - in one direction then instantly
flick<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> control<00:00:19.500> stick<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> opposite

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
flick the control stick in the opposite

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
flick the control stick in the opposite
direction<00:00:20.609> though<00:00:21.480> when<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> say<00:00:21.960> flick

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
direction though when I say flick

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
direction though when I say flick
I<00:00:22.529> mean<00:00:23.220> flick<00:00:34.399> when<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> first<00:00:35.730> try<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I mean flick when you first try this you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.139 
I mean flick when you first try this you
might<00:00:36.719> accidentally<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.469> an<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.860> spot<00:00:38.250> -<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
might accidentally do an on spot - this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.459 
might accidentally do an on spot - this
means<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.629> flick<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> opposite

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
means your flick in the opposite

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.740 
means your flick in the opposite
direction<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.129> held<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.610> too<00:00:41.850> long<00:00:42.090> you'll

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
direction is held for too long you'll

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
direction is held for too long you'll
definitely<00:00:43.200> take<00:00:43.440> some<00:00:43.680> practice<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.430> once

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
definitely take some practice but once

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
definitely take some practice but once
you<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> timing<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.570> it'll<00:00:46.260> become

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you get the timing down it'll become

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.540 
you get the timing down it'll become
second<00:00:46.920> nature<00:00:48.590> ok<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.649> now<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.309> know

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
second nature ok so now that you know

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
second nature ok so now that you know
how<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
how to do it what can you do with it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
how to do it what can you do with it
well<00:00:52.829> perfect<00:00:53.129> pivoting<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:53.760> itself<00:00:54.090> can

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
well perfect pivoting by itself can

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
well perfect pivoting by itself can
already<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> good<00:00:55.379> spacing<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.100> mind<00:00:56.309> game

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
already be a good spacing and mind game

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
already be a good spacing and mind game
tool<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> best<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> my

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
tool but the best use for it in my

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
tool but the best use for it in my
opinion<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.100> definitely<00:00:59.340> combining<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> with

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
opinion is definitely combining it with

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.229 
opinion is definitely combining it with
an<00:01:00.750> attack<00:01:01.340> perfect<00:01:02.340> pivoting<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:02.969> jabs

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
an attack perfect pivoting in two jabs

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
an attack perfect pivoting in two jabs
can<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> safe<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> quick<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> catch

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
can be a safe and quick way to catch

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.490 
can be a safe and quick way to catch
incoming<00:01:05.760> opponents<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> change<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.290> C

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
incoming opponents if you change your C

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.170 
incoming opponents if you change your C
stick<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> tilt<00:01:08.159> instead<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> smash<00:01:08.850> tacks

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
stick the tilt instead of smash tacks

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
stick the tilt instead of smash tacks
you'll<00:01:09.510> even<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.200> perfect<00:01:10.740> pivot

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you'll even be able to perfect pivot

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.520 
you'll even be able to perfect pivot
into<00:01:11.430> tilts<00:01:11.820> essentially<00:01:12.689> sliding<00:01:13.170> tilts

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
into tilts essentially sliding tilts

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.070 
into tilts essentially sliding tilts
same<00:01:14.040> goes<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.310> smash<00:01:14.700> tacks<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.570> effect<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
same goes for smash tacks the effect is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
same goes for smash tacks the effect is
very<00:01:16.290> similar<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> wave<00:01:17.130> dashing<00:01:17.610> into

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
very similar to wave dashing into

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.109 
very similar to wave dashing into
attacks<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.330> melee<00:01:19.520> aside<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.640> giving<00:01:20.850> you

attacks in melee aside from giving you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
attacks in melee aside from giving you
an<00:01:21.240> upper<00:01:21.600> hand<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.320> spacing<00:01:22.770> game

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
an upper hand with your spacing game

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
an upper hand with your spacing game
there<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.430> many<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:23.909> situations<00:01:24.600> where<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
there are many more situations where you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
there are many more situations where you

move<00:01:56.119> now<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.630> have<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.929> faster<00:01:57.289> alternative

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
move now you have a faster alternative

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.480 
move now you have a faster alternative
so<00:01:59.179> far<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.630> good<00:01:59.840> right<00:01:59.899> well<00:02:00.740> I'm<00:02:00.979> not<00:02:01.220> done

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
so far so good right well I'm not done

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.999 
so far so good right well I'm not done
there<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.210> perfect<00:02:02.479> pivot<00:02:03.020> grabbing<00:02:03.530> which<00:02:03.860> is

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
there is perfect pivot grabbing which is

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.130 
there is perfect pivot grabbing which is
a<00:02:04.039> much<00:02:04.369> faster<00:02:04.759> version<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.659> reverse

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
a much faster version of reverse

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.710 
a much faster version of reverse
grabbing<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:07.310> course<00:02:07.579> special<00:02:08.209> moves<00:02:08.450> can

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
grabbing and of course special moves can

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.590 
grabbing and of course special moves can
be<00:02:08.750> used<00:02:09.049> with<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.289> tech<00:02:09.560> as<00:02:09.739> well<00:02:10.420> now<00:02:11.420> let's

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
be used with this tech as well now let's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600 
be used with this tech as well now let's
talk<00:02:11.750> about<00:02:11.810> perfect<00:02:12.260> pivot<00:02:12.739> lengths<00:02:13.220> each

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
talk about perfect pivot lengths each

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.860 
talk about perfect pivot lengths each
character<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.330> different

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
character is different

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.110 
character is different
the<00:02:15.140> longer<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.650> initial<00:02:16.040> -<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.640> longer<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the longer the initial - the longer the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.420 
the longer the initial - the longer the
perfect<00:02:17.480> pivot<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.290> be<00:02:18.410> accurate<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.010> use<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
perfect pivot to be accurate I use the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.850 
perfect pivot to be accurate I use the
squares<00:02:19.850> on<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.269> side<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:21.049> Omega<00:02:21.410> version

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
squares on the side of the Omega version

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.070 
squares on the side of the Omega version
of<00:02:22.010> Windy<00:02:22.430> Hill<00:02:22.459> zone<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.239> measure<00:02:23.450> through<00:02:23.959> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
of Windy Hill zone to measure through a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.059 
of Windy Hill zone to measure through a
fixed<00:02:24.380> camera<00:02:24.530> view

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
fixed camera view

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.580 
fixed camera view
for<00:02:25.519> example<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.390> longest<00:02:26.810> perfect<00:02:27.230> pivot

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
for example the longest perfect pivot

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.860 
for example the longest perfect pivot
will<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.860> captain<00:02:28.310> Falcons<00:02:28.760> at<00:02:29.000> six<00:02:29.480> squares

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
will be captain Falcons at six squares

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
will be captain Falcons at six squares
and<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.620> shortest<00:02:31.069> will<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.340> Jigglypuff's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
and the shortest will be Jigglypuff's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.210 
and the shortest will be Jigglypuff's
at<00:02:32.150> two<00:02:32.480> squares<00:02:32.810> anyways<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:34.040> are<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
at two squares anyways here are the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.830 
at two squares anyways here are the
perfect<00:02:34.430> pivot<00:02:34.849> lengths<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:35.330> every

perfect pivot lengths for every
character<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.590> left<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.250> full<00:02:37.459> list<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.849> the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
character I left a full list in the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.670 
character I left a full list in the
description<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.900> check<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.590> you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
description so check that out if you

want everything I've said works on the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.940 
want everything I've said works on the
3ds<00:02:42.230> as<00:02:42.470> well

3ds as well

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.130 
3ds as well
except<00:02:43.459> there's<00:02:43.820> no<00:02:43.880> C<00:02:44.269> stick<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.870> won't

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
except there's no C stick so you won't

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.020 
except there's no C stick so you won't
be<00:02:45.260> able<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.530> buffer<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> smash<00:02:46.430> tag<00:02:46.760> or<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.060> tilt

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
be able to buffer a smash tag or a tilt

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.280 
be able to buffer a smash tag or a tilt
alright<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.269> think<00:02:50.600> I've<00:02:50.690> covered<00:02:50.930> everything

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
alright I think I've covered everything

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.440 
alright I think I've covered everything
that<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.709> wanted<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.040> talk<00:02:52.220> about<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.269> urge

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
that I wanted to talk about and I urge

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.599 
that I wanted to talk about and I urge
you<00:02:53.690> guys<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.900> experiment<00:02:54.799> more<00:02:54.829> with<00:02:55.220> perfect

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
you guys to experiment more with perfect

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.699 
you guys to experiment more with perfect
pivoting<00:02:56.030> because<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.510> think<00:02:56.569> if<00:02:56.959> mastered<00:02:57.530> it

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
pivoting because I think if mastered it

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.800 
pivoting because I think if mastered it
can<00:02:57.859> really<00:02:58.190> change<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.640> metagame<00:02:58.910> with<00:02:59.600> that

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
can really change the metagame with that

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.750 
can really change the metagame with that
