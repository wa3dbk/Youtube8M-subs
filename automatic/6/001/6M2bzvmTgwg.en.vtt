00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.033
- YOU LOOK FANTASTIC,
AND ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:06.266
YOU HAVE THREE BOYS
THAT HAVE TO BE--

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.666
KINGSTON AND ZUMA
AND APOLLO NOW.

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.700
- YEAH.
- AND I JUST SAW THEM BACKSTAGE.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.500
THEY COULD NOT BE CUTER.
- THEY ALL WANTED TO COME.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.866
THEY DON'T--THEY DON'T REALLY
GO TO "THE VOICE" THAT OFTEN,

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.100
BUT THEY WANTED TO COME
TO THIS.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.633
THEY LOVE YOU.
- OH, WELL...

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.500
[cheers and applause]

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.700
THEY'RE SMART.
- THEY ARE SMART.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.733
- I'VE ALWAYS SAID ALL THREE
OF THEM ARE SMART, AND...

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.966
[laughter]

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.433
SMARTEST BOYS
I'VE EVER MET.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.100
- I THINK YOU HELD ZUMA
WHEN HE WAS, LIKE,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.300
ONLY TEN DAYS OLD.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.633
- YEAH, I THINK ZUMA--
AND KINGSTON, I THINK,

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:35.933
WAS ON THE SHOW.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.333
all: AWW.
- YEAH.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.833
- OH, THAT'S APOLLO.
- THAT'S APOLLO.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.966
- THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.066
- APOLLO IS WEARING A LITTLE
GOLD LEATHER JACKET BACKSTAGE

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.633
WITH WINGS, WHICH IS--

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:47.433
I MEAN, WHERE DO YOU FIND
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.033
NO, THAT'S KINGSTON, RIGHT?
OR IS THAT--

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.733
- THAT WAS KINGSTON.
YEAH, THAT WAS HERE.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.066
- YEAH.
- LOOK HOW CUTE HE IS.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.900
- AND THAT'S--HOW OLD IS HE NOW?
HE'S LIKE--

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.266
- EIGHT, YEAH.
IT'S CRAZY.

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.466
- I KNOW.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.400
SO YOU HAVE THREE KIDS,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.033
AND THEY'RE VERY WELL-BEHAVED,
THOUGH.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.200
THEY REALLY ARE.
THEY'RE COOL--

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.400
NO, THEY'RE NOT?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.533
AROUND ME, THEY ARE.
- THEY WERE GOOD.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.666
I WAS PROUD OF THEM TODAY.
- YEAH.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.100
- BUT IT GETS CRAZY.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.066
I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT WHOLE, LIKE,

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.733
4:00 TO 8:00 AT NIGHT
IS LIKE CHAOS.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.400
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE THE CRAZY TIME
AT OUR HOUSE.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.500
AND THE OTHER DAY,
WE WERE DRIVING HOME,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.466
AND I WAS THINKING,
"OKAY, MOTEL 6.

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.566
"IF I COULD JUST FIND ONE,
I'M JUST GONNA GO THERE

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.833
AND, LIKE, DISAPPEAR."

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:27.300
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
DISAPPEAR FROM MY LIFE.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.800
BUT, NO, THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.166
- I DON'T EVER WANT TO HEAR
YOU'RE AT A MOTEL 6, OKAY?

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.433
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT TO READ
THAT THEY FOUND GWEN STEFANI

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:34.700
HANGING OUT
AT A MOTEL 6.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.466
- OKAY, I PROMISE.
- YEAH.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.666
- THAT WAS THE OLDEN DAYS.

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.100
[laughter]

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.266
- NOW YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.966
AND IT'S--WHAT--
12 YEARS NOW, RIGHT?

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.466
- 12 YEARS, YEAH.
- THAT'S GREAT.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:46.166
[cheers and applause]

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.400
YOU HAVE THE SAME--
FOR WHATEVER REASON--

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.966
- YOU GOT ALL THE PICTURES.
IT'S SO FUNNY.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.733
- WELL, THEY COME UP
WHENEVER I SAY ANYTHING.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.133
I IMAGINE THINGS,
AND THEY HAPPEN.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.433
- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:57.800
- THAT'S THE POWER I HAVE.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.433
BUT YOU--REALLY,
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:00.700
THE TABLOIDS JUST--

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.466
AND THEY DO THE SAME THING
WITH PORTIA AND I.

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.300
THEY JUST ACT
LIKE THERE'S A PROBLEM,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.000
LIKE Y'ALL ARE SPLITTING UP
OR SOMETHING ALL THE TIME,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.433
AND YOU'RE HAPPY.

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.366
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
- WE'RE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.033
WE GO THROUGH OUR CYCLES
OF, LIKE, BEING SO HAPPY

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.500
AND THEN GOING,
"OH, MY GOSH,"

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.333
LIKE, AND THEN BEING SO HAPPY,
AND IT'S CRAZY.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.066
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:20.600
THAT I'VE KNOWN HIM
AS LONG AS I HAVE

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.700
AND THAT WE STILL HAVE FUN
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.266
AND HE LEFT TODAY TO GO
ON HIS LITTLE,

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.566
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT A WEEK TOUR,

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:28.466
WHICH IS--HE HASN'T BEEN
DOING THAT FOR A WHILE,

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:29.900
SO IT'S--
IT FEELS WEIRD.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.966
IT'S LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH,
WHEN I GO HOME,

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:33.533
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO
RIGHT TO SLEEP."

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.433
LIKE, IT'S WEIRD.
I DON'T--I'M NOT GONNA--

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:36.633
YOU KNOW, IT'S CRAZY

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:38.133
TO HAVE THAT LITTLE BIT
OF FREEDOM,

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.033
BUT I'M GONNA MISS HIM.
