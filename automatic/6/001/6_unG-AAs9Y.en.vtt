from this season

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.800 
from this season
my<00:00:30.950> goose<00:00:31.160> we<00:00:31.340> will<00:00:31.760> be<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.060> try<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:32.300> be<00:00:32.570> in<00:00:32.660> the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
my goose we will be to try to be in the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.220 
my goose we will be to try to be in the
top<00:00:32.990> five<00:00:33.230> I<00:00:34.570> think<00:00:35.570> will<00:00:35.720> be<00:00:35.810> very<00:00:35.840> difficult

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
top five I think will be very difficult

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.750 
top five I think will be very difficult
but<00:00:36.650> it's<00:00:37.280> what<00:00:37.460> I<00:00:37.730> will<00:00:38.420> go<00:00:38.540> for<00:00:39.640> it's<00:00:40.640> a

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
but it's what I will go for it's a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.670 
but it's what I will go for it's a
package<00:00:40.970> of<00:00:41.300> everything<00:00:41.720> I<00:00:41.840> like<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.230> idea<00:00:42.290> of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
package of everything I like the idea of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.610 
package of everything I like the idea of
the<00:00:44.230> of<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:45.739> system<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.520> be<00:00:47.330> very<00:00:48.200> equal

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
the of this system to be very equal

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.240 
the of this system to be very equal
between<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.400> drivers<00:00:49.820> no<00:00:50.690> teams<00:00:51.250> everybody

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
between the drivers no teams everybody

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.640 
between the drivers no teams everybody
will<00:00:52.489> get<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.850> same<00:00:53.030> sense<00:00:53.330> so<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.989> like<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.379> lot

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
will get the same sense so I like a lot

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.130 
will get the same sense so I like a lot
this<00:00:54.800> ID<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.430> price<00:00:55.809> compared<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:56.989> the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
this ID and the price compared to the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.240 
this ID and the price compared to the
car<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:58.100> we<00:00:58.280> will<00:00:58.460> get<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:58.910> he's<00:00:59.870> really<00:01:03.250> yeah

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
car that we will get is he's really yeah

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.700 
car that we will get is he's really yeah
perfect<00:01:04.910> so<00:01:05.150> everything<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.200> package<00:01:06.530> is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
perfect so everything is the package is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.590 
perfect so everything is the package is
really<00:01:07.100> great<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:08.240> was<00:01:08.330> really

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
really great and it was really

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.790 
really great and it was really
appropriate<00:01:08.960> for<00:01:09.490> for<00:01:10.490> me<00:01:10.869> now<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.680> I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
appropriate for for me now that that I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.490 
appropriate for for me now that that I
see<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.130> car<00:01:13.340> I'm<00:01:13.550> even<00:01:13.850> more<00:01:13.880> excited<00:01:14.500> it

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
see the car I'm even more excited it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.990 
see the car I'm even more excited it
looks<00:01:15.979> great<00:01:17.830> we<00:01:18.830> can<00:01:19.009> see<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.310> was<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.610> lot<00:01:19.940> of

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
looks great we can see that was a lot of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.370 
looks great we can see that was a lot of
work<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:20.780> car<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.460> think<00:01:22.970> will<00:01:23.149> be<00:01:23.380> will

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
work on this car so I think will be will

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.889 
work on this car so I think will be will
be<00:01:24.410> very<00:01:24.680> performant<00:01:25.479> there<00:01:26.479> are<00:01:26.570> some<00:01:26.750> people

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
be very performant there are some people

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.870 
be very performant there are some people
that<00:01:27.080> maybe<00:01:27.619> don't<00:01:27.830> want<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.399> girl<00:01:28.640> in

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
that maybe don't want to see a girl in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.109 
that maybe don't want to see a girl in
Formula<00:01:29.509> One<00:01:29.690> so<00:01:30.649> i<00:01:30.680> will<00:01:31.130> have<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.490> prove

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
Formula One so i will have to prove

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.770 
Formula One so i will have to prove
myself<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:34.100> show<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.310> i<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.790> make<00:01:35.510> some

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
myself and to show that i can make some

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.580 
myself and to show that i can make some
very<00:01:36.290> good<00:01:36.590> result<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.600> will<00:01:38.810> depend<00:01:39.320> on

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
very good result so this will depend on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.149 
very good result so this will depend on
that<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.479> have<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:42.229> be<00:01:42.350> fast<00:01:42.860> and

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
that you you have to to be fast and

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.460 
that you you have to to be fast and
we'll<00:01:44.120> have<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.479> fast<00:01:44.510> in<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.020> formula<00:01:45.320> 2

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
we'll have to be fast in the formula 2

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.260 
we'll have to be fast in the formula 2
and<00:01:45.710> show<00:01:46.310> what<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.520> can<00:01:46.700> do<00:01:46.940> in<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.090> formula<00:01:47.479> to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
and show what I can do in the formula to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.469 
and show what I can do in the formula to
this<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.890> big<00:01:53.290> guest<00:01:54.290> for<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.860> end<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.310> be

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
this is the big guest for the end to be

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.070 
this is the big guest for the end to be
trying<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.659> test<00:01:56.900> this<00:01:57.049> formula<00:01:57.470> 1<00:01:57.850> see<00:01:58.850> it's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
trying to test this formula 1 see it's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.440 
trying to test this formula 1 see it's
it's<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.229> big<00:02:00.380> opportunity<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:01.250> do<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.640> but

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's a big opportunity to do this but

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.410 
it's a big opportunity to do this but
for<00:02:02.689> sure<00:02:02.900> i'm<00:02:03.080> i'm<00:02:03.409> looking<00:02:04.310> for<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.850> to
