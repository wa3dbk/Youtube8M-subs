this<00:00:06.310> lesson<00:00:06.700> was<00:00:06.790> about<00:00:07.000> using<00:00:07.299> the<00:00:07.390> rich

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
this lesson was about using the rich

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.570 
this lesson was about using the rich
text<00:00:07.839> box<00:00:08.200> control<00:00:08.410> and<00:00:08.950> in<00:00:09.190> this<00:00:09.309> try<00:00:09.519> it

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
text box control and in this try it

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.129 
text box control and in this try it
we're<00:00:09.820> going<00:00:09.940> to<00:00:10.030> modify<00:00:10.360> the<00:00:10.510> simple<00:00:10.900> edit

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
we're going to modify the simple edit

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.660 
we're going to modify the simple edit
program<00:00:11.320> we've<00:00:11.650> been<00:00:11.860> building<00:00:12.070> in<00:00:12.309> previous

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
program we've been building in previous

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.330 
program we've been building in previous
lessons<00:00:12.880> to<00:00:13.780> give<00:00:14.110> some<00:00:14.380> functionality<00:00:14.920> to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
lessons to give some functionality to

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.779 
lessons to give some functionality to
the<00:00:15.370> Edit<00:00:15.880> menu<00:00:15.910> commands<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:18.220> this<00:00:18.430> is<00:00:18.580> the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
the Edit menu commands so this is the

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.090 
the Edit menu commands so this is the
simple<00:00:19.119> edit<00:00:19.300> program<00:00:19.480> as<00:00:19.779> it<00:00:19.930> stands<00:00:20.199> now<00:00:20.380> if

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
simple edit program as it stands now if

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.310 
simple edit program as it stands now if
we<00:00:21.640> open<00:00:21.880> up<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.300> edit<00:00:22.570> menu<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:23.050> double

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
we open up the edit menu and double

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.900 
we open up the edit menu and double
click<00:00:23.410> on<00:00:23.560> one<00:00:23.740> of<00:00:23.769> these<00:00:23.890> menu<00:00:24.189> items<00:00:24.250> will<00:00:24.789> go

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
click on one of these menu items will go

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.519 
click on one of these menu items will go
to<00:00:24.970> its<00:00:25.119> event<00:00:25.390> handler<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:26.019> we<00:00:26.350> can<00:00:26.500> see

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
to its event handler and we can see

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.870 
to its event handler and we can see
we've<00:00:26.769> got<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.920> bunch<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.220> message<00:00:27.609> box

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
we've got a bunch of message box

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.689 
we've got a bunch of message box
statements<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:29.769> need<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:29.949> do<00:00:30.160> is<00:00:30.369> hook

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
statements all we need to do is hook

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.220 
statements all we need to do is hook
these<00:00:30.849> up<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.359> rich<00:00:31.480> text<00:00:31.720> box<00:00:32.050> control

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.740 
these up to the rich text box control
and<00:00:32.949> that's<00:00:33.040> pretty<00:00:33.370> easy<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:34.480> called

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
and that's pretty easy it's called

we'll<00:00:39.219> just<00:00:39.340> invoke<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.730> methods<00:00:40.210> we<00:00:40.270> need<00:00:40.510> so

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
we'll just invoke the methods we need so

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.569 
we'll just invoke the methods we need so

going to copy this so i can paste it i

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.600 
going to copy this so i can paste it i
don't<00:01:03.399> have<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.579> retype<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.340> copy

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
don't have to retype it for the copy

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.670 
don't have to retype it for the copy
command<00:01:07.560> we'll<00:01:08.560> just<00:01:08.740> invoke<00:01:09.130> copy

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.920 

that<00:01:13.460> copies<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.880> current<00:01:14.240> selection<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.840> the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
that copies the current selection to the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.030 
that copies the current selection to the
clipboard<00:01:15.460> for<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.520> cut<00:01:17.500> we<00:01:18.500> just<00:01:18.710> invoke<00:01:19.010> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
clipboard for a cut we just invoke the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.020 
clipboard for a cut we just invoke the
cut<00:01:19.370> command<00:01:20.110> for<00:01:21.110> paste<00:01:21.580> we<00:01:22.580> invoke<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
cut command for paste we invoke the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.590 
cut command for paste we invoke the
paste<00:01:23.300> command<00:01:23.780> which<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.880> parent<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.360> paste

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
paste command which the parent the paste

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.630 
paste command which the parent the paste
command<00:01:27.220> these<00:01:28.220> are<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:28.400> extremely

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
command these are all extremely

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.060 
command these are all extremely
straightforward<00:01:29.470> for<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.590> delete<00:01:30.860> command

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
straightforward for the delete command

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.800 
straightforward for the delete command
we<00:01:31.430> want<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.670> remove<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.210> current<00:01:32.479> selection

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
we want to remove the current selection

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.990 
we want to remove the current selection
in<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.050> control<00:01:33.500> but<00:01:33.830> not<00:01:34.040> copy<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.850> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
in the control but not copy to the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.150 
in the control but not copy to the
clipboard<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.410> we'll<00:01:36.530> do<00:01:36.680> is<00:01:36.800> we'll<00:01:36.950> just

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
clipboard so what we'll do is we'll just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.370 
clipboard so what we'll do is we'll just
say<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:39.410> selected<00:01:39.979> text<00:01:40.250> equals<00:01:41.119> an<00:01:41.540> empty

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
say the selected text equals an empty

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.280 
say the selected text equals an empty
string<00:01:42.710> or<00:01:43.240> if<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.360> prefer<00:01:44.390> there's<00:01:45.229> a

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
string or if you prefer there's a

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.730 
string or if you prefer there's a
constant<00:01:45.740> string<00:01:46.369> dot<00:01:46.880> empty<00:01:47.869> which

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
constant string dot empty which

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.889 
constant string dot empty which
represents<00:01:49.340> an<00:01:49.430> empty<00:01:49.670> string<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.660> makes

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
represents an empty string that makes

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.620 
represents an empty string that makes
your<00:01:50.990> code<00:01:51.200> slightly<00:01:51.800> more<00:01:52.009> self<00:01:52.340> documenting

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
your code slightly more self documenting

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.969 
your code slightly more self documenting
instead<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.720> using<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.229> empty<00:01:54.710> quotes

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
instead of using the empty quotes

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.710 
instead of using the empty quotes
although<00:01:55.490> most<00:01:55.729> programmers<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.420> use<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
although most programmers just use the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.830 
although most programmers just use the
empty<00:01:56.810> quotes<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.759> finally<00:01:59.090> for<00:01:59.240> select<00:01:59.600> all

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
empty quotes and finally for select all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.880 
empty quotes and finally for select all
we<00:02:00.259> have<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.590> text<00:02:00.920> box<00:02:01.130> dot<00:02:01.460> select<00:02:01.729> all

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
we have the text box dot select all

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.620 
we have the text box dot select all
these<00:02:03.890> are<00:02:04.040> extremely<00:02:04.460> easy<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.360> let's<00:02:05.479> run

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
these are extremely easy so let's run

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.370 
these are extremely easy so let's run
the<00:02:05.720> program<00:02:08.020> I'll<00:02:09.020> type<00:02:09.410> some<00:02:09.709> text<00:02:09.739> here<00:02:11.380> so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
we can experiment let me make the let me

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.990 
we can experiment let me make the let me
grab<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.239> text<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.440> word<00:02:19.100> some<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.880> all

grab that text the word some and all

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.259 
grab that text the word some and all
type<00:02:20.390> cut<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.070> gets<00:02:22.310> removed<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.090> can

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
type cut so it gets removed as you can
