ponds and small reservoirs like this can
offer<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.350> tremendous<00:00:05.069> fishing<00:00:05.549> plus<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.509> lot

offer some tremendous fishing plus a lot
of<00:00:06.870> times<00:00:07.080> they're<00:00:07.350> close<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.799> home<00:00:08.040> they're

of times they're close to home they're

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.129 
of times they're close to home they're
overlooked<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.300> fish<00:00:09.510> aren't<00:00:09.780> pressure

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
overlooked the fish aren't pressure

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.169 
overlooked the fish aren't pressure
they're<00:00:10.500> naive<00:00:10.769> they're<00:00:11.130> easier<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.670> catch

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
they're naive they're easier to catch

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.839 
they're naive they're easier to catch
so<00:00:12.570> anglers<00:00:13.019> who<00:00:13.170> find<00:00:13.530> spots<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.549> can

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
so anglers who find spots like this can

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.880 
so anglers who find spots like this can
really<00:00:15.120> make<00:00:15.509> them<00:00:15.660> pay<00:00:15.929> off<00:00:15.960> with<00:00:16.379> some<00:00:16.590> great

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
really make them pay off with some great

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.019

fun activity

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.080 
fun activity
now<00:00:18.539> then<00:00:18.840> fish<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.710> ponds<00:00:20.039> are<00:00:20.340> no<00:00:20.550> different

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
now then fish in ponds are no different

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.509 
now then fish in ponds are no different
from<00:00:21.150> fish<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.779> big<00:00:22.020> lakes<00:00:22.350> they're<00:00:23.010> not<00:00:23.250> just
