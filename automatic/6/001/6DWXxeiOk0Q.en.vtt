00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 and so i need to tie such a foundation 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.870
 in order to bind her I type 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 the chain of air loops here is the length 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.929
 arbitrarily determined by each 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.880
 determines independently and dials that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.300
 and the chain of air loops which 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.650
 you need a genuine individual and for example 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.429
 I typed here for such a based 210 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.279
 air loops for display and here I am grandfather 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.960
 first loop and in it I will dial 15 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.950
 air loops here doesn't matter 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:48.030
 How much do I get the most important show what 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 bind the edges 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.890
 14 15 here is an example of such a chain 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 of course for a scarf you need to tie 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 at least 150 and 200 air loops 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.930
 possible and a big dependency is what 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.270
 long scarf you want 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.189
 3 loops of lifting and further knitting 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.140
 double crochet stitches 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.380
 nakid at the point of injecting grab 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 working thread tying 2 loops and 2 5 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 years and a double crochet so 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.299
 typesetting chain to the end of the series it will be 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.060
 the first row of the base scarf due to the fact 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.549
 what will you have of course air loops 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.000
 more, respectively, and a column with 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.540
 nakida will be more important here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.329
 how do i tie the edges right therefore 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.860
 the number of loops does not matter 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.610
 because they tally up equally 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.610
 last loop 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.260
 so here's the last loop and here it is 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.350
 last loop and last loop i 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:29.710
 I knit 5 double crochets into one 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 loop 1 2 3 4 5 pull up and on here 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.150
 I knitting unfolded so 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.190
 I knitted round the second side 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.190
 double-sided chain 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.360
 also to the last loop 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.350
 so this is the penultimate loop and 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:31.280
 knit the last loop 5 columns 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:33.860
 double crochet 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.900
 and connecting bar with the beginning next 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.880
 this is how the first row will turn out 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.310
 here here's how I already said and you 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.860
 there will be more loops respectively 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.590
 long part but at the ends of this part 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.230
 It should be here the last loop on 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.800
 5 double crochet is the first row 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.800
 the foundation
