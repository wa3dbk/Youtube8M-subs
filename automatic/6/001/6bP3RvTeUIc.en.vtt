00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.340 
half I believe his Austrian player who
took<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> few<00:01:27.360> steps<00:01:27.450> before<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.229> down

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
took a few steps before going down

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
took a few steps before going down
because<00:01:28.920> he<00:01:29.340> doesn't<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:29.850> he's<00:01:30.030> gonna<00:01:30.119> get

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
because he doesn't think he's gonna get

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.090 
because he doesn't think he's gonna get
the<00:01:30.390> call<00:01:30.540> unless<00:01:30.869> he<00:01:30.990> does<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.829> players

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the call unless he does so the players

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.010 
the call unless he does so the players
make<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.579> difficult<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.119> officials<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
make it very difficult for officials and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
make it very difficult for officials and
I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.680> biggest<00:01:34.860> part<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I think the biggest part about it is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.280 
I think the biggest part about it is
that<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.600> something<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
that if if they do something about it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
that if if they do something about it
you<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> from<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> FIFA<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you a from the FIFA what they can do is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
you a from the FIFA what they can do is
stop<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> embellishment<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.200> make<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
stop the embellishment and make it

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
stop the embellishment and make it
easier<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:40.920> referees<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.579> there's<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
easier for referees because there's a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
easier for referees because there's a
hard<00:01:42.060> enough<00:01:42.210> job<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.720> certainly<00:01:43.259> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
hard enough job as it is certainly is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.270 
hard enough job as it is certainly is
was<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> hint<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> offside<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.049> one

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
was there a hint of offside in that one

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
was there a hint of offside in that one
there<00:01:47.280> certainly<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> hint<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> offside

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
there certainly was a hint of offside

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
there certainly was a hint of offside
for<00:01:48.960> sure<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> we'll<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> look<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
for sure and we'll have a look at it and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.530 
for sure and we'll have a look at it and
it<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:50.549> difficult<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.149> everybody

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
it was very difficult one for everybody

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
it was very difficult one for everybody
and<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.770> my<00:01:52.950> opinion<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.430> believe<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.820> was

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and and in my opinion I believe it was

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
and and in my opinion I believe it was
but<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.079> much<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> cross<00:01:55.649> here

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
but this not so much on the cross here

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
but this not so much on the cross here
everybody's<00:01:56.340> perfect<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:56.939> time<00:01:57.180> run<00:01:57.420> great

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
everybody's perfect good time run great

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
everybody's perfect good time run great
touch<00:01:57.960> good<00:01:58.229> ability<00:01:58.680> comes<00:01:59.040> back<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.369> his

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
touch good ability comes back on his

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.469 
touch good ability comes back on his
left<00:01:59.640> foot<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.060> where<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> trouble

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
left foot and that's where the trouble

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.209 
left foot and that's where the trouble
is<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> goal<00:02:00.899> scorer<00:02:01.170> actually<00:02:01.500> starts<00:02:01.890> when

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is the goal scorer actually starts when

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.340 
is the goal scorer actually starts when
the<00:02:02.369> strike<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.850> struck<00:02:03.210> he<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.049> in

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the strike was struck he was actually in

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.899 
the strike was struck he was actually in
an<00:02:04.500> offside<00:02:04.860> position<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.640> further

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
an offside position he was further

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.249 
an offside position he was further
advanced<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
advanced as we could see there on the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.680 
advanced as we could see there on the
stop<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.920> freeze<00:02:08.190> he's<00:02:08.700> level<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
stop the freeze he's level with the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.330 
stop the freeze he's level with the
goalkeeper<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.649> he's<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> only<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.310> in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
goalkeeper but he's the only one in

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.840 
goalkeeper but he's the only one in
there

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
there

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.820 
there
as<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.090> falls<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.540> him<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.320> goes<00:02:13.470> directly

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
as it falls to him if it goes directly

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
as it falls to him if it goes directly
in<00:02:14.130> off<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> shot<00:02:14.670> he<00:02:15.180> would<00:02:15.300> say<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.810> was

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
in off the shot he would say that it was

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.900 
in off the shot he would say that it was
a<00:02:15.960> good<00:02:16.620> goal<00:02:16.830> he<00:02:17.070> would<00:02:17.190> be<00:02:17.310> passive<00:02:17.760> but

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
a good goal he would be passive but

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.730 
a good goal he would be passive but
because<00:02:18.240> he's<00:02:18.660> offside<00:02:19.110> position<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.620> it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
because he's offside position when it

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.410 
because he's offside position when it
strikes<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.280> when<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.760> actually<00:02:21.060> finds<00:02:21.270> his

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
strikes and when it actually finds his

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.120 
strikes and when it actually finds his
way<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> him<00:02:21.900> then<00:02:22.020> he<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.350> then<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.590> active

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
way to him then he would then be active

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.200 
way to him then he would then be active
and<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.640> would<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.820> goal<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.120> gonna

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
and there would be a goal we're gonna

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.490 
and there would be a goal we're gonna
have<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> good<00:02:24.630> overhead<00:02:25.050> shot<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.470> right

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
have a good overhead shot of it right

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.470 
have a good overhead shot of it right

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
yeah you can't try and get the angle

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.440 
yeah you can't try and get the angle
right<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> cut<00:02:35.580> when<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.760> ball<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.030> kicked

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
right of the cut when the ball is kicked

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.360 
right of the cut when the ball is kicked
that<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> looked<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.260> close<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.740> if<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.920> level

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that it looked so close and if you level

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.460 
that it looked so close and if you level
obviously<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:38.970> second<00:02:39.330> defender<00:02:39.810> then

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
obviously for that second defender then

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.010 
obviously for that second defender then
he's<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> very<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> opinion<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
he's a very in the opinion of the

he's a very in the opinion of the
assistant<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> referee<00:02:44.450> referee

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.240 
assistant and the referee referee
Austria<00:02:46.230> should<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.500> three<00:02:46.740> nothing<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.130> that
