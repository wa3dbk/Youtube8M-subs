this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:08.179> factory<00:00:09.179> IMS<00:00:09.950> bearing<00:00:11.150> which<00:00:12.150> has

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
this is a factory IMS bearing which has

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.359 
this is a factory IMS bearing which has
had<00:00:12.920> catastrophic<00:00:13.920> failure<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.750> see

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
had catastrophic failure and one can see

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.900 
had catastrophic failure and one can see
that<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> balls<00:00:18.500> has<00:00:19.500> been<00:00:19.850> mauled<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:22.910> lost

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
that the balls has been mauled and lost

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.960 
that the balls has been mauled and lost
its<00:00:25.189> shapes<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:27.619> at<00:00:28.619> one<00:00:28.890> time<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.670> balls

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
its shapes and at one time the balls

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.540 
its shapes and at one time the balls
actually<00:00:32.899> came<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.380> their<00:00:34.620> regular

actually came out of their regular

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
actually came out of their regular
tracks<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.040> into<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> sides<00:00:39.170> creating<00:00:40.170> these

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
tracks and into the sides creating these

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.510 
tracks and into the sides creating these
cavities<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:43.010> where<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> balls<00:00:44.340> were
