00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that lasted I got a foreshadowed this

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.659 
that lasted I got a foreshadowed this

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
here we go it's a it's reminiscent of

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.310 
here we go it's a it's reminiscent of
the<00:05:03.520> shield<00:05:03.880> helicarrier<00:05:04.210> in<00:05:04.960> terms<00:05:05.229> of

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the shield helicarrier in terms of

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.290 
the shield helicarrier in terms of
construction<00:05:05.620> with<00:05:06.279> lots<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.639> shiny<00:05:06.969> metal

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
pillars so that's cool see if that

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.610 
pillars so that's cool see if that
