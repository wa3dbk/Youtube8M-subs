work<00:01:08.970> we're<00:01:09.970> pretty<00:01:10.390> much<00:01:10.570> exceeding<00:01:11.110> that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
work we're pretty much exceeding that

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.930 
work we're pretty much exceeding that
our<00:01:11.470> coursework<00:01:12.010> is<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.160> little<00:01:12.430> more<00:01:12.520> in<00:01:12.700> depth

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
our coursework is a little more in depth

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.390 
our coursework is a little more in depth
because<00:01:13.660> we<00:01:14.410> have<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.590> lot<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.070> different

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
because we have a lot of different

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.610 
because we have a lot of different
commitments<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.000> we<00:01:16.150> like<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:17.470> our

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
commitments that we like to have our

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.790 
commitments that we like to have our
personnel<00:01:18.100> trained<00:01:18.430> for<00:01:19.050> advanced<00:01:20.050> hazardous

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
materials training codes training so our

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.650 
materials training codes training so our
program<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.850> little<00:01:24.880> bit<00:01:25.150> longer<00:01:25.390> than<00:01:25.600> some

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
program is a little bit longer than some

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.420 
program is a little bit longer than some

of the other programs in the state but

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.360 
of the other programs in the state but
it's<00:01:27.550> much<00:01:28.150> more<00:01:28.330> comprehensive<00:01:29.160> I'm<00:01:30.160> not

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
it's much more comprehensive I'm not

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's much more comprehensive I'm not
going<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.550> say<00:01:30.790> I'm<00:01:31.540> not<00:01:31.690> gonna<00:01:31.840> say<00:01:32.080> is<00:01:32.290> in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
going to say I'm not gonna say is in

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.310 
going to say I'm not gonna say is in
depth<00:01:32.980> as<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.160> boot<00:01:33.400> camp<00:01:33.640> but<00:01:34.200> discipline<00:01:35.200> is

depth as a boot camp but discipline is

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.560 
depth as a boot camp but discipline is
an<00:01:35.410> important<00:01:35.770> part<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:36.010> firefighting<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.760> we

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
an important part of firefighting and we

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.750 
an important part of firefighting and we
are<00:01:37.720> pretty<00:01:37.900> well<00:01:38.020> disciplined<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.250> it's

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
are pretty well disciplined and and it's

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.870 
are pretty well disciplined and and it's
an<00:01:39.910> important<00:01:40.300> aspect<00:01:40.570> because<00:01:41.280> when<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.730> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
an important aspect because when on the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.090 
an important aspect because when on the
fire<00:01:43.090> ground<00:01:43.120> when<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.870> firefighter<00:01:44.170> needs<00:01:44.950> to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
fire ground when a firefighter needs to

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.070 
fire ground when a firefighter needs to
accomplish<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.580> task<00:01:45.700> they<00:01:46.690> have<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.960> be

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
accomplish a task they have to be

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.190 
accomplish a task they have to be
focused<00:01:47.320> they<00:01:47.680> have<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.980> be<00:01:48.100> disciplined<00:01:48.550> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
focused they have to be disciplined and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.290 
focused they have to be disciplined and
so<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.380> take<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.680> pretty<00:01:50.830> seriously<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:52.210> don't

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
so we take it pretty seriously we don't

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.980 
so we take it pretty seriously we don't
put<00:01:52.510> up<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:52.660> with<00:01:53.650> too<00:01:53.980> many<00:01:54.100> problems<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
put up with with too many problems so

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.410 
put up with with too many problems so
and<00:01:56.740> that's<00:01:57.190> that's<00:01:57.520> what<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:58.150> know<00:01:58.270> because

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
and that's that's what you know because

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.940 
and that's that's what you know because
there's<00:01:58.690> an<00:01:58.780> expectation<00:01:59.050> from<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.560> public

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
there's an expectation from the public

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.070 
there's an expectation from the public
