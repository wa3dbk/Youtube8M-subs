that is using our LCD or CRT to predict

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
that is using our LCD or CRT to predict
what<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.960> printed<00:00:19.650> output<00:00:19.800> will<00:00:20.279> actually

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
what the printed output will actually

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.710 
what the printed output will actually
look<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.320> before<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> continue<00:00:22.619> further

second part of this video to get the
full<00:00:30.029> instruction<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.619> also<00:00:31.800> important<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
full instruction it's also important to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459 
full instruction it's also important to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
know that there are large differences

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.549 
know that there are large differences
between<00:00:35.010> viewing<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:36.050> print<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
between viewing a print which is a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.490 
between viewing a print which is a
reflective<00:00:38.250> display<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.660> screen<00:00:40.140> which

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
reflective display and your screen which

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
reflective display and your screen which
is<00:00:40.649> an<00:00:40.800> emissive<00:00:41.309> display<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.270> emits<00:00:42.750> light

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
is an emissive display one emits light

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.130 
is an emissive display one emits light
the<00:00:43.350> other<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.739> reflects<00:00:44.250> light<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
the other one reflects light and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.660 
the other one reflects light and
obviously<00:00:46.140> they're<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.860> different<00:00:47.219> tools

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
obviously they're very different tools

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.990 
obviously they're very different tools
with<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.420> work<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:50.010> would<00:00:50.640> never

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
with which to work so I would never

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.040 
with which to work so I would never
accept<00:00:51.600> an<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.110> screen<00:00:52.559> soft<00:00:53.250> proof<00:00:53.730> as

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
accept an on screen soft proof as

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
accept an on screen soft proof as
literal<00:00:55.050> reality<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.430> printed

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
literal reality to what the printed

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.270 
literal reality to what the printed
output<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.539> look<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.770> sure<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
output would look like so be sure to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.049 
output would look like so be sure to
always<00:00:59.520> make<00:01:00.059> test<00:01:00.510> proves<00:01:01.129> -<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.489> accurately

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
always make test proves - to accurately

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.560 
always make test proves - to accurately
assess<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> output<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:05.570> this

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
assess what the output is like this

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850 
assess what the output is like this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this out which is exactly why I've

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.859 
this out which is exactly why I've
chosen<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.180> image<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.630> I'm<00:01:42.750> gonna

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
chosen this image but I'm gonna

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
chosen this image but I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.710> clearly<00:01:44.329> currently<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
demonstrate this clearly currently this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
image is in the native color space which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.620 
image is in the native color space which
is<00:01:48.180> Adobe<00:01:48.630> RGB<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.030> ahead<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
is Adobe RGB I now want to go ahead and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.539 
is Adobe RGB I now want to go ahead and
see<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> look<00:01:53.520> like

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
see what this is going to look like

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.850 
see what this is going to look like
using<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.420> custom<00:01:54.840> profile<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.680> I've

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
using the custom profile that I've

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
using the custom profile that I've
created<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:57.479> Epson<00:01:57.899> 7880<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.130> Museo

silver<00:02:00.719> rag<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> how<00:02:02.280> I'm<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.670> do<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
silver rag so how I'm gonna do that is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.950 
silver rag so how I'm gonna do that is
go<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> view<00:02:04.619> proof<00:02:05.460> setup<00:02:06.060> whoops
