00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:13.230
 now the most important thing 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.289
 iron is the metal what the rope is 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.369
 a soul of metal and the soul of iron e 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.439
 I don't know if one thing they explained to me 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 on something that I understood or if I am 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.310
 inventing or simply inventing 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 the warm water 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 but I have understood in the years that more if 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 quick to do the draft operation 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.010
 tuning less less around you more 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.530
 over time it maintains this balance 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.570
 that we love it so for me indeed 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.059
 when she was ready for an apple she was giving 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.149
 if I had other jobs to do maybe and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.340
 I don't have five free minutes available 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.590
 to do what I'm about to do maybe 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 I also put it aside I do the others 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.010
 things in the assembly of the stage of the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.590
 guinea pig draw situation I don't know what 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 right now and I keep the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.149
 possibility to do this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.979
 when I have five real minutes for me 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.210
 because we are the most delicate part of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.490
 all 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 it will seem absurd to go along with it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.950
 fool 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.830
 but here I say a lot in this way 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 so now I'm going to explain 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.159
 I will start from the bottom coming up 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.710
 to sing to me with no care 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.630
 particular we have a mobile bridge that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.229
 however it is unbeaten so I have no problems 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.450
 as with the floyd remain suspended and therefore 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.550
 I have to watch out for how to part but 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 we say that it will simply welcome 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:43.100
 how is my weight for me to know 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.710
 after cell phone gives you a general blow 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.429
 not perfect but as similar as possible 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.429
 to what it should be 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.170
 so you guitar did n't play 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.329
 so you can play the guitar as well 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.409
 just perfect so life i owe 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.719
 put in this position for 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.819
 granting it is fine by a subsidiary 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.950
 so however the final cover is this 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.890
 it can also vary by 10 cents 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.510
 I can even tell you who will be there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.970
 the tummy maybe holds a little more like this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.709
 tends to push a little more then more 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.440
 one you hold exactly as of di 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:29.440
 resound as you will play it most not 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.660
 you have problems then from another 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.720
 controlled general I try to do the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.069
 more like as much as possible its linear 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.140
 perfect tuning speech once 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.140
 I have it in joke 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.020
 then so now I'm going to do it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.730
 sketch that I will do with this movement 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.530
 of the hand 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.500
 in these three points more or less than 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.080
 rope there is no fixed rule of its own 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.540
 on that rate is that thing we say that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.650
 It is somewhat a gradually rising to 123 and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.540
 do this 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.030
 after doing the first stretch that 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.290
 you have to shoot a lot but not too much 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.780
 so it's a thing in the feeling 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.350
 you must still feel more or less with 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.030
 count I don't know if you can see it fold 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:27.290
 just enough to break it 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.730
 let's say so after that now I will 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.920
 I show horizontally but I do it 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.500
 vertically in this operation 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.820
 I crushed the rope as you see the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.450
 rope fell to retire on time 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.150
 I do the operation is obtained now you 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.030
 I do the task last time this 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.410
 time had been holding perfect after the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.450
 third time you do it for me is 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.460
 enough because anyway after when 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.800
 re the net at the end of it all 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.240
 around you will realize that this is me 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.030
 cantino is growing 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.360
 it is because the iron is settled 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.070
 laid down and then starts again at 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.450
 shrinking is no longer dilated and therefore 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:11.380
 will go after proceeds from the intonation 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.380
 let's go on with the other strings 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.360
 so soul three times 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.590
 how do you see the operation 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.740
 it's a quick pass of three shots 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.740
 been beautiful 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.229
 ok let's go check it out 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.990
 I sing it right that it is growing 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:54.990
 you see the sun growing simo and also the 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.419
 little and it is decreasing 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.689
 ok let's check my put in place either 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.689
 okay 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.030
 I would say that tuned in this instant
