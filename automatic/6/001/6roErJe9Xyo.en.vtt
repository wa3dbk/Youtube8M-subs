let's<00:02:05.729> give<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.090> label<00:02:06.299> as<00:02:06.600> well<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.930> going

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
let's give it a label as well I'm going

to call it data now if you check perform
a<00:02:10.020> quick<00:02:10.229> format<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:10.950> format<00:02:11.280> faster<00:02:11.970> but

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
a quick format it will format faster but

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.070 
a quick format it will format faster but
it<00:02:12.300> won't<00:02:12.480> check
