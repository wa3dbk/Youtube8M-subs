 a can of mayonnaise that they were 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 confiscated since neither the seasoning nor

 women bought without knowing its content 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.950

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.260
 crocodile passed the inspection how bad is 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.090
 that then escaped in mid-flight causing 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.040
 panic among passengers who 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.890
 they moved so much that they unbalanced the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.229
 plane at the end the plane collided with a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.690
 home in the fall only one passenger and the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.670
 crocodile came out unscathed and it was thanks 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.910
 the passenger who has the anecdote 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.180

 with sunglasses to make it go through 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.239
 someone asleep from a movie 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.459
 snakes and turtles under clothing not 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.530
 I was carrying a handbag but if you 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.420
 exotic snakes and turtles in 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.250
 plastic bags and tucked into their 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 pants but the tomographic detector 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.750
 brought to light the deception of a man of 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.060
 miami tadpoles and since they did not leave them 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.040
 pass in the bottle the passenger decided 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.769
 put them to the mouth clear that the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.959
 agents thought it was water but as 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.150
 he did not swallow it they discovered it act 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.319
 followed she claimed not to want to leave them 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.650
 because they were a gift 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.719
 Stuffed animals loaded with ammunition a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 man took advantage that he was traveling with his son 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.609
 to store your weapon and ammunition in 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 small toys x-rays the 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.510
 they detected and they had to confiscate it 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.370
 the mascot disguised as a hamburger 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.099
 a Chinese traveler tried his pet 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.469
 a small turtle will travel with him in a 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.750
 aircraft despite the current restrictions 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.090
 and for that he hid it in a hamburger 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.249
 chicken do not worry the turtle is 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.989
 well since a friend who accompanied the and 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:34.480
 to fire him he took over the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.400
 turtle before the sadness of its owner that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.170
 he had to leave his pet to thousands of 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.900
 kilometers away 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.239
