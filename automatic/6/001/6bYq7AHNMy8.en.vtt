00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.909
 and that was especially evident in the tours 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.819
 trier 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
 Frank was with great effort and well in scene 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 also we have a header storage the starting point 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.050
 about the constant commuting between midfield and attack and the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 real Torriecher characterize Rainer Ernst 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 § 3 no 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.010
 Rival technical delicacy his second prank 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 Andreas Storm 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 Seriously by car 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.069
 Algeria's keeper 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.169
 continue under pressure 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 also tested by Pätzold r 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.499
 because with relatives 105 million 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.889
 the deadline of two weeks 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.889
 a tough shot 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.799
 For the game on Wednesday saw the codeword say something was missing 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.810
 this report the Algerian 2 and, of course, still to come 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:43.519
 speak 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.409
 but also goal scenes by Michael Glowatzki indeed indeed Dakar 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.480
 Maxhütte at 10 goal dangerous actions immediately detail tight 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.909
 In the first few minutes shot was shown 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.549
 technically skillful the consequences of the action 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.769
 Acceptance and shot 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.939
 in slow motion this becomes even clearer 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.739
 Polo which does not hesitate even in difficult situations with the shot on goal 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.189
 then a skilful header also this action was worth a goal 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.289
 in the second half similar pictures but judge for yourself 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.979
 v 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.699
 do everything she finally hits the gate, the offside flag is what 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 led his viewers to the following remark 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.250
 Now Michael Glowatzki himself will know best that not just bad luck 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.979
 At least in some situations his boots stuck to the missing ones 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.000
 But little experience and serenity became noticeable but hopeful 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.620
 This achievement was always right 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.310
 Glowacz drops the installers do yesterday, the choir also showed up 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.860
 Team mates again in good shape it seems all the more so striker 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.740
 Obviously, they are not entitled to an offer, especially since they are afraid in time 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.599
 got going 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.210

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:42.259

 how that was observed against Algeria spy in the closing stages 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.289
 twice in the second half substitute Wismut Torsten Jörg 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.129
 Parry Weißflog brilliantly 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.129
 here against Bologna 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.249
 in the last few minutes clearer concentration camps leave our defenses 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.110
 Illuminates completely free 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.520
 scored the number 1 for the guests technically 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.759
 a second carelessness came our cover with the second 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.699
 goals 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.259
