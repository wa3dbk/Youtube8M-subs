asking me what bag this was so I thought

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.710 
asking me what bag this was so I thought
that<00:04:20.170> was<00:04:20.340> funny<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:22.480> know<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.690> just

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
that was funny that you know it just

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.980 
that was funny that you know it just
totally<00:04:23.020> does<00:04:23.290> change<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.710> look<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.040> bag

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
totally does change the look of the bag

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.350 
totally does change the look of the bag
so<00:04:25.990> that's<00:04:26.860> another<00:04:27.160> way<00:04:27.430> if<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:27.700> have<00:04:28.000> if<00:04:28.210> you

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
so that's another way if you have if you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.400 
so that's another way if you have if you
happen<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.870> bag<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.170> has<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.650> strap

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
happen to have a bag that has this strap

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.540 
happen to have a bag that has this strap
but<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.490> versatile<00:04:34.030> bag<00:04:34.240> I'll<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.430> love<00:04:36.430> it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550
