it<00:01:32.280> complements<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> white<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.840> well<00:01:35.360> no<00:01:36.360> i

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it complements the white so well no i

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.109 
it complements the white so well no i
just<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> red<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.700> i'm<00:01:38.970> probably
