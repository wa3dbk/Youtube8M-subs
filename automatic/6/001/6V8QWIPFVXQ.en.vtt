the<00:00:10.650> jun<00:00:11.370> 2011<00:00:11.700> republic<00:00:12.240> frigate<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.719> going

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the jun 2011 republic frigate is going

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.829 
the jun 2011 republic frigate is going
to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.019> like<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:14.400> supposed<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
to be like it's supposed to be I think a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.710 
to be like it's supposed to be I think a
remake<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:17.210> because<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.359> looks<00:00:18.570> almost

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
remake of this because it looks almost

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
remake of this because it looks almost
exactly<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.529> same<00:00:19.619> only<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.279> grey<00:00:20.670> this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
exactly the same only it's grey this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.109 
exactly the same only it's grey this
time<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> thing<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.119> 2007

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
time so this is the thing like the 2007

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
time so this is the thing like the 2007
I<00:00:24.240> think<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.720> Paul<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> cruiser<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
I think I Paul the cruiser one of the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
I think I Paul the cruiser one of the
first<00:00:26.400> steps<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.760> had<00:00:27.500> I've<00:00:28.500> managed<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
first steps I had I've managed to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.240 
first steps I had I've managed to
preserve<00:00:29.160> most<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> kind<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> dusty<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
preserve most of it kind of dusty and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.470 
preserve most of it kind of dusty and
that<00:00:32.250> piece<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.669> couldn't<00:00:33.000> find<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> when<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that piece I couldn't find it when I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.319 
that piece I couldn't find it when I
have<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.320> built<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.910> couldn't

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
have it when I built it and I couldn't

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
have it when I built it and I couldn't
front<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.930> found<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.410> finally<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.100> never

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
front and I found it finally but I never

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.330 
front and I found it finally but I never
really<00:00:38.640> put<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> only

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
really put it on and so the only

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
really put it on and so the only
difference<00:00:41.430> between<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.420> me<00:00:42.660> republic
