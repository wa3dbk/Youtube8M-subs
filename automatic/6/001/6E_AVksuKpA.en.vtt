00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.889
 hello good to all this video is a 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.109
 little to introduce them into the method 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.550
 suzuki suzuki method is used 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.820
 worldwide 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.699
 it is not that it is the best but it is 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.450
 true that it is used by a lot of people and 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:32.230
 especially when they have to introduce 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.890
 the world of the violin to the children I know 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.220
 there is viola of piano has different 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.160
 kinds of methods but good apart from 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.070
 suzuki that I would advise you to look at others and 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.410
 I have another method out there that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.650
 right now I do not remember what it is but 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.870
 well I'll tell you this time this 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.960
 sketch of these little ones that are for 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.290
 go teaching a bit of the suzuki method 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.380
 how is it evolving going numbered 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.690
 the songs do not have to leave 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.750
 from the first to the last 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.490
 yes or yes but good and it 's network is 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.620
 recommendable what happens that surely 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.110
 there is some song with its themes that 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.760
 another and you take it with more pleasure so 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.210
 So much you will do is much better 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.320
 of the first for example of you have the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.270
 suzuki violins with bai ling part volume 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.030
 one is different 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.009
 comes with a cd and bue indicates us too 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.039
 a little bit gives us a little 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.350
 instructions how to grab the bow of 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.549
 how to have the positioning of the violin 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.649
 as you can see good these are little things 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:54.350
 that I'm pointing at him and for example 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.689
 the exercises you have 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.939
 have your restlessness and going to be that is 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.729
 the first song that I think everything 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.229
 start playing but basically I want to 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.560
 that you have a couple of things in mind 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.860
 is worth a quarter note in metronome write to her 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.390
 equals 60 beats therefore 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.790
 It is recommended that you put the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.590
 metronome to go touching him because 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.200
 surely you will go or speed up or 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.989
 slowing down in the rhythm when going to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.130
 play vacation with the metronome what 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.980
 is going to help you is the town top top 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.160
 help with the rhythm and then another thing that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 it's basic how to use the arch theme 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.120
 OK then 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.070
 we have 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.180
 right in this we do not have bad the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.480
 next if in variation b 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.220
 we have 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.220
 to see how I put it 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.400
 it's worth that it looks like a bridge 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.090
 is that the arch goes from top to bottom 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.450
 the against what looks like a v is expensive 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.530
 down above is to say 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.880
 when we see a bridge our arch goes 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.050
 from top to bottom 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.470
 when we see the ub we go down to 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.890
 above 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.890
 yes 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.350
 Well, these are a couple of things that 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 you have to have basic at the moment 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.860
 what 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.420
 we go forward or some kind of 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.250
 doubt then you are saying it is already 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.560
 tell you how good I invite you to 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.689
 you go knowing or knowing others 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.760
 types of channels that do 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.700
 professionals and they teach you very well 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.980
 the truth and how good this is 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.319
 this channel basically as a support not 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.989
 It has been a learning process as such because 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.640
 I'm not a violin professional then 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.870
 I commit commit failures 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.629
 this is simply like a support that is 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.480
 it happened to me so you can see that not all 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.840
 world is born with a violin in the arm that 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.060
 a person from my fifth can learn 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.150
 to play the violin with more or less 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.889
 results with more or less time because 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.269
 that we have to take into account but 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.000
 what 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.940
 encourage with it according to whether it arises 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.130
 some doubt they can help you tell me 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.790
 than nothing 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.790
 for boys
