00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.219
 i 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.470
 you need humor in your life you need 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.970
 comedy at home in manuals a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.430
 activist for the rights of the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.950
 animals has the house full of dogs 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.080
 rescued but ironically it is the dog 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.260
 from the neighbor who does not let him sleep 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.690
 need comedy at home 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.579
 how are they asking for comedy at home 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.699
 today the dog exists to the public 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.899
 Manuel is stingy in your case you are a 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.829
 activist for the rights of the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.949
 animals 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 and the neighbor's dog does not let you sleep 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.979
 The truth is that I greatly admire what 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.899
 they do defend the rights of the 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.030
 animals for example the other day it was me 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.949
 approached one of these activists this that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 nothing more than name is that they join signatures 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.879
 nothing else that tells me hey brothers that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.559
 We are collecting signatures because it results 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.600
 that the Japanese fishermen are 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.159
 catching many dolphins in the nets 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 of tuna we do not want to join signatures 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.929
 to no longer catch dolphins in the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 tuna nets but that no more 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.929
 signing a paper no longer moves the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.149
 dolphins that come to see there work 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.520
 I say I am no biologist 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.850
 no, but I imagine that they should 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.000
 to be saving rather the tuna I do not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.690
 I imagine that you catch more tuna in the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.789
 tuna nets that dolphins but like the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.610
 tuna does not bounce nice or swing 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.890
 balls in his trunk not like that as well as that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.150
 they fry the tuna or bone that hypocrites 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.190
 save tuna 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.250
 and talking about animals recently left me 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.570
 my girlfriend this animal I did not have a 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.520
 occasion in which she went to live 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.350
 away and we had to resort to this 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.540
 Sexting phenomenon have not heard 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 talk about sexting is this practice in 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.440
 which one sends spiky messages with 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.620
 else no text messages as well 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.620
 As horny we send the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.830
 messages as well as hello 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.160
 how are you I'm here alone in my 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.880
 fourth there are rose petals on the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.750
 bed there are also scented candles on 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.750
 the credence 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.090
 there is a thesaurus also 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.530
 there it is but here I am thinking of you 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.390
 and what would you do to me 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.400
 then the day I in the bank how bad 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.720
 moment to receive this message 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.510
 I'll put it on you 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.900
 and then I take it out 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.129
 and so several times 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.129
 Until I get sleepy 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.870
 Hahaha dear of chango well 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.000
 maybe it's not noticed but I'm a 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.410
 scientist ladies and gentlemen study 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.930
 communication Sciences 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.610
 as a scientist I think that the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.520
 Mexicans all Mexicans without 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.370
 exception we are good assholes because 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.690
 we all eat or have eaten chile who 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.730
 He was the first Mexican to eat a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.050
 chile and why I do not imagine that 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.270
 It was the pre-Hispanic era 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.480
 a subject walking there with his 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.910
 flip flops and your loincloth and suddenly you 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.160
 found there a one plant with 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.840
 elongated fruits of colors then 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.300
 he grabbed our fruits and brought them to his 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.930
 indigenous face and bit him with his 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.690
 indigenous teeth 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.050
 and I imagine that he exclaimed something like 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.300
 without mother expense 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.950
 the 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.780
 and in that moment in which you are 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.010
 suffering that there will be the first thing that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.040
 would think your brain 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.320

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.700
