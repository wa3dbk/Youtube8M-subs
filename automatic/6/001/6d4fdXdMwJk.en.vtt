00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.930 

also<00:01:35.050> remember<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.650> replace<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.520> radio<00:01:36.910> that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
also remember to replace the radio that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.730 
also remember to replace the radio that
showed<00:01:37.450> what<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.750> was<00:01:38.050> obviously<00:01:38.590> being

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
showed what I was obviously being

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.420 
showed what I was obviously being
followed<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.750> am<00:01:40.990> probably<00:01:41.470> obviously

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
followed because I am probably obviously

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.080 
followed because I am probably obviously
being<00:01:42.610> followed<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.370> signal<00:01:45.670> crash<00:01:45.910> is

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
being followed so the signal crash is

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.940 
being followed so the signal crash is
into<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.360> headquarters<00:01:46.600> because<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.560> guess

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
into the headquarters because I guess

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.830 
into the headquarters because I guess
it's<00:01:48.250> hard<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.640> fly<00:01:48.820> with<00:01:48.970> one<00:01:49.030> arm<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.480> this

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
it's hard to fly with one arm and this

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.440 
it's hard to fly with one arm and this
allows<00:01:50.110> Jubilee<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.680> escape<00:01:51.040> only<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:52.030> be

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
allows Jubilee to escape only to be

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.660 
allows Jubilee to escape only to be
