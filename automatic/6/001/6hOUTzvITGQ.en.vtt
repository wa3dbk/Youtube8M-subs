00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
little bit now so the details might be a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.810 
little bit now so the details might be a
little<00:00:40.649> bit<00:00:40.829> hard<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> especially<00:00:41.340> on

red things around our bros are like
little<00:01:16.080> flower<00:01:16.680> petals<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.200> my<00:01:19.200> skin<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.130> my

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
little flower petals so my skin was my

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
little flower petals so my skin was my
arm<00:01:20.729> wasn't<00:01:21.150> big<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
arm wasn't big enough to have this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
arm wasn't big enough to have this
circle<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> comes<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.909> my<00:01:24.780> artist

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
circle that comes around so my artist

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.200 
circle that comes around so my artist
instead<00:01:25.409> decided<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> use<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.549> petals<00:01:26.909> so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
first they were a little worried that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
first they were a little worried that
the<00:01:46.430> image<00:01:47.430> wasn't<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> fit<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.180> arm

the image wasn't going to fit on my arm

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
the image wasn't going to fit on my arm
because<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.229> tiny<00:01:49.470> arms<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.130> have

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
because I have really tiny arms I have

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.170 
because I have really tiny arms I have
no<00:01:50.399> muscles<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.240> week<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.369> um<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.909> it

no muscles because I week and um but it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.880 
no muscles because I week and um but it
worked<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.600> obviously<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> tattoo

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890

while so they are there were two months
on<00:02:23.920> march<00:02:24.430> first<00:02:25.230> um<00:02:26.230> they're<00:02:26.770> really

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
on march first um they're really

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.580 
on march first um they're really
starting<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.150> age<00:02:28.570> up<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.080> mean<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:29.380> look<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
starting to age up I mean they look a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.090 
starting to age up I mean they look a
lot<00:02:29.770> older<00:02:29.830> than<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.340> are<00:02:30.370> um<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:33.070> a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
lot older than they are um I have a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.920 
lot older than they are um I have a
buttload<00:02:33.610> beads<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.300> obviously<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.690> dyed<00:02:34.900> my

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
buttload beads and obviously I dyed my

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.710 
buttload beads and obviously I dyed my
hair<00:02:35.110> back<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.470> brown<00:02:35.740> um<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.240> my<00:02:37.360> natural

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
hair back to brown um so that my natural

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.330 
hair back to brown um so that my natural
color<00:02:37.900> could<00:02:38.170> grow<00:02:38.320> back<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.710> um<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:42.160> is

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
color could grow back in um so this is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.060 
color could grow back in um so this is
my<00:02:42.660> undercut<00:02:43.660> or<00:02:43.930> my<00:02:44.110> side<00:02:44.350> cuts<00:02:44.650> grown<00:02:44.920> out<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
my undercut or my side cuts grown out a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.980 
my undercut or my side cuts grown out a
lot<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.000> almost<00:02:46.240> time<00:02:46.690> to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
lot so it's going to be almost time to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.270 
lot so it's going to be almost time to
dread<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.070> baby<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:48.790> um<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.890> I'm<00:02:51.100> gonna

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
stick that away for now because it is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.980

maintenance<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.670> them<00:03:27.820> because<00:03:27.970> they're

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
maintenance on them because they're

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.440 
maintenance on them because they're
already<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.580> tame<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.880> guess<00:03:31.060> would<00:03:31.209> be<00:03:31.269> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
already so tame I guess would be the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.170 
already so tame I guess would be the
right<00:03:31.600> word<00:03:31.840> ah<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.700> haven't<00:03:34.090> been

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
right word ah so I haven't been

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.229 
right word ah so I haven't been
bothering<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:35.190> really<00:03:36.190> tighten<00:03:36.700> them<00:03:36.940> up<00:03:37.030> that

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
bothering to really tighten them up that

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.540 
bothering to really tighten them up that
much<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.630> mean<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.019> start<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.380> did<00:03:38.590> I've<00:03:39.220> done

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
much I mean at the start I did I've done

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.340 
much I mean at the start I did I've done
I've<00:03:39.910> crocheted<00:03:40.360> them<00:03:40.510> three<00:03:40.780> times<00:03:40.989> all<00:03:41.260> the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350

I've crocheted them three times all the
way<00:03:41.440> through<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.209> haven't<00:03:43.510> done<00:03:43.750> them<00:03:43.959> this

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
month and I probably should because I've

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.570 
month and I probably should because I've
got<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> lot<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.600> loose<00:03:47.049> hair<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.620> some<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.489> the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
here you can see like the ends are

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600 
here you can see like the ends are
getting<00:03:53.380> kind<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.620> scraggly<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.310> other<00:03:54.489> than
