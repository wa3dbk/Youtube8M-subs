00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
were escapes I'm not sure if you can

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.580 
were escapes I'm not sure if you can
actually<00:00:41.460> sell<00:00:41.670> them<00:00:41.790> back<00:00:42.590> unfortunately

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
actually sell them back unfortunately

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
actually sell them back unfortunately
they<00:00:43.739> didn't<00:00:44.010> compensate<00:00:44.309> people<00:00:44.520> who<00:00:45.300> had

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
they didn't compensate people who had

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.119 
they didn't compensate people who had
castle<00:00:45.870> wars<00:00:45.989> games<00:00:46.200> completed<00:00:46.680> by<00:00:46.800> giving

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
castle wars games completed by giving

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
castle wars games completed by giving
them<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.910> silver<00:00:48.450> tickets<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:48.960> consumable

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
them the silver tickets as consumable

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
them the silver tickets as consumable
ones<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.760> quite<00:00:51.120> sure<00:00:51.149> why<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.660> didn't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
ones I'm not quite sure why they didn't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
ones I'm not quite sure why they didn't
do<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.770> had<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.280> amount<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
do that because they had the amount of

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
do that because they had the amount of
games<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.059> played<00:00:54.360> saved<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
games that we played saved with the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.340 
games that we played saved with the
castle<00:00:56.399> high<00:00:56.640> scores<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.300> you'd<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
castle high scores so you'd think it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
castle high scores so you'd think it
would<00:00:58.469> make<00:00:58.590> sense<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.949> give<00:00:59.129> everyone<00:00:59.430> silver

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
would make sense to give everyone silver

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
would make sense to give everyone silver
tickets<00:01:00.239> based<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> number<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.710> yeah

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
tickets based on that number but yeah

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
tickets based on that number but yeah
they<00:01:02.730> didn't<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.870> can't<00:01:04.229> really

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
they didn't do that so I can't really

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.730 
they didn't do that so I can't really
test<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.830> easily<00:01:05.270> they<00:01:06.270> also

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
test those easily they also

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.600 
test those easily they also
significantly<00:01:07.740> increase<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> stats<00:01:08.460> on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
significantly increase the stats on

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
significantly increase the stats on
Castle<00:01:08.970> Wars<00:01:09.090> gear<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.990> profound<00:01:10.320> armor

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
Castle Wars gear the profound armor

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
Castle Wars gear the profound armor
which<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.369> level<00:01:11.700> 40<00:01:12.090> before<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> was<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
which was level 40 before it was the it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
which was level 40 before it was the it
was<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> same<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:13.950> rune<00:01:14.250> armor<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.180> level

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
was the same as rune armor is now level

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.440 
was the same as rune armor is now level
80<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.320> tribrid<00:01:16.830> gear<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.759> good<00:01:18.299> in

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
80 and it's tribrid gear so it's good in

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
80 and it's tribrid gear so it's good in
all<00:01:18.659> three<00:01:18.990> combat<00:01:19.320> styles<00:01:19.740> which<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.159> pretty

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
all three combat styles which is pretty

the<00:01:49.950> UC<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.579> slightly<00:01:50.939> confusing<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> my

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the UC is slightly confusing in my

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
the UC is slightly confusing in my
opinion<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.670> very

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
opinion and not I don't think it's very

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.600 
opinion and not I don't think it's very
well<00:01:54.149> explained<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.960> many<00:01:55.500> places<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.460> besides

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
well explained in many places so besides

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.880 
well explained in many places so besides
the<00:01:56.939> change<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> scoring<00:01:58.290> system<00:01:58.469> they

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200

people<00:02:15.430> over<00:02:15.700> who<00:02:16.329> had<00:02:16.780> had<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.409> trim

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
people over who had had the trim

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.610 
people over who had had the trim
requirement<00:02:18.909> done<00:02:19.030> before<00:02:19.359> but<00:02:20.109> they<00:02:20.379> didn't

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
requirement done before but they didn't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.780

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
have enough tickets like if they had

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
have enough tickets like if they had
lost<00:02:21.999> a<00:02:22.180> lot<00:02:22.329> of<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.540> games<00:02:22.629> they<00:02:22.989> played<00:02:23.200> so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
lost a lot of the games they played so

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.039 
lost a lot of the games they played so
if<00:02:24.219> you<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.579> the<00:02:24.730> trim<00:02:25.060> before<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.659> still

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
if you have the trim before you still

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.530 
if you have the trim before you still
have<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:27.670> terms<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.239> time

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
have it now and in terms of the time

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720 
have it now and in terms of the time
difference<00:02:28.900> from<00:02:29.170> before<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:30.129> change<00:02:30.489> and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
difference from before this change and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.449 
difference from before this change and
after<00:02:31.060> if<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.959> boost<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.859> your<00:02:33.010> games<00:02:33.129> and

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
after if you boost all of your games and

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.750 
after if you boost all of your games and
win<00:02:33.609> them<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:33.879> then<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.659> takes<00:02:35.400> 2075<00:02:36.400> games

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
win them all then it takes 2075 games

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
win them all then it takes 2075 games
instead<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.389> 5,000<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.139> your<00:02:38.290> trim<00:02:38.590> which<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
instead of 5,000 to your trim which is a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.129 
instead of 5,000 to your trim which is a
huge<00:02:39.310> difference<00:02:39.549> but<00:02:40.389> in<00:02:40.480> order<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.780> combat

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
huge difference but in order to combat

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.569 
huge difference but in order to combat
that<00:02:41.200> they<00:02:41.530> made<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.129> only<00:02:42.340> get

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
that they made it so that you only get

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.670 
that they made it so that you only get
gold<00:02:42.819> tickets<00:02:43.209> if<00:02:43.480> there<00:02:43.989> are<00:02:44.079> five<00:02:44.349> or<00:02:44.560> more

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
gold tickets if there are five or more

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
gold tickets if there are five or more
people<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.310> each<00:02:45.579> team<00:02:45.719> so<00:02:46.719> it's

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
people on each team so it's

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.530 
people on each team so it's
significantly<00:02:48.700> harder<00:02:48.879> to<00:02:49.120> boost<00:02:49.299> now<00:02:49.480> you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
significantly harder to boost now you

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.149 
significantly harder to boost now you
have<00:02:49.719> to<00:02:49.840> actually<00:02:49.989> find<00:02:50.409> people<00:02:50.769> not<00:02:50.980> many

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
have to actually find people not many

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.330 
have to actually find people not many
people<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.760> boost<00:02:52.269> Riven<00:02:52.719> to<00:02:52.930> lose<00:02:53.079> so<00:02:54.069> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
people to boost Riven to lose so that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420 
people to boost Riven to lose so that
method<00:02:55.329> of<00:02:55.419> boosting<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:56.099> difficult<00:02:57.099> but<00:02:57.219> it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
method of boosting is difficult but it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.110 
method of boosting is difficult but it
would<00:02:57.689> cut<00:02:58.689> your<00:02:58.840> time<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.980> half<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.730> better

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
would cut your time in half and better

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.170 
would cut your time in half and better
than<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.419> actually<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:03.459> other<00:03:03.639> method<00:03:03.849> that

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
than that actually the other method that

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.149 
than that actually the other method that
people<00:03:04.510> are<00:03:04.629> doing<00:03:04.900> already<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.799> that<00:03:05.829> they're

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
people are doing already is that they're

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.089 
people are doing already is that they're
boosting<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.599> world<00:03:08.139> 48<00:03:08.560> which<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:08.919> the

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
boosting in the world 48 which is the

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.539 
boosting in the world 48 which is the
high<00:03:09.340> level<00:03:09.489> world<00:03:09.760> there<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:12.129> just<00:03:12.400> a

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
high level world there and it's just a

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.220 
high level world there and it's just a
tied<00:03:12.819> game<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.389> there<00:03:13.659> are<00:03:13.719> a<00:03:13.780> ton<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.959> people

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
tied game so there are a ton of people

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.869 
tied game so there are a ton of people
on<00:03:14.319> each<00:03:14.439> team<00:03:14.469> and<00:03:15.010> they<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.549> make<00:03:15.699> sure

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
on each team and they just make sure

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.999 
on each team and they just make sure
that<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.120> other<00:03:16.239> team<00:03:16.449> doesn't<00:03:16.659> score<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.199> so

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:18.009 
that the other team doesn't score and so

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.860 
that the other team doesn't score and so
that<00:03:18.189> allows<00:03:18.430> them<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.819> get<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.359> full<00:03:19.629> term

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
that allows them to get the full term

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170 
that allows them to get the full term
requirement<00:03:20.319> in<00:03:20.669> 4150<00:03:21.669> games<00:03:21.849> rather<00:03:22.060> than

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
requirement in 4150 games rather than

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.199 
requirement in 4150 games rather than
5,000<00:03:22.900> which<00:03:23.439> is<00:03:23.590> still<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.799> very<00:03:24.459> large<00:03:24.819> time

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
5,000 which is still a very large time

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.149 
5,000 which is still a very large time
save<00:03:25.479> so<00:03:26.139> i<00:03:27.129> do<00:03:27.669> think<00:03:28.049> well<00:03:29.049> i'm<00:03:29.709> not<00:03:29.859> terribly

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
save so i do think well i'm not terribly

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.670 
save so i do think well i'm not terribly
pleased<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.599> trim<00:03:31.900> requirement<00:03:32.500> being

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
pleased with the trim requirement being

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.039 
pleased with the trim requirement being
so<00:03:32.889> much<00:03:33.040> shorter<00:03:33.430> but<00:03:33.939> i<00:03:34.000> do<00:03:34.090> think<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.599> a

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
so much shorter but i do think it is a

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.050 
so much shorter but i do think it is a
good<00:03:35.500> thing<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.739> get<00:03:36.009> people<00:03:36.310> actually

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
good thing to get people actually

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
kang it and yeah that's just how it will

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
be but i know i think the idea behind it

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.039 
be but i know i think the idea behind it
was<00:03:46.419> pretty<00:03:47.109> good<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:49.150> then<00:03:49.359> in<00:03:49.509> addition<00:03:49.599> to

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
was pretty good so then in addition to

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.809 
was pretty good so then in addition to
those<00:03:50.199> major<00:03:50.799> changes<00:03:51.310> with<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.519> scoring

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
those major changes with a scoring

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.490 
those major changes with a scoring
system<00:03:51.909> in<00:03:52.299> room<00:03:52.689> calm<00:03:52.900> acquirement<00:03:53.379> they

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
system in room calm acquirement they

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.259 
system in room calm acquirement they
also<00:03:53.620> added<00:03:53.829> some<00:03:53.979> other<00:03:54.310> really<00:03:54.939> major

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
also added some other really major

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.459 
also added some other really major
things<00:03:55.569> so<00:03:56.159> actual<00:03:57.159> gameplay<00:03:57.669> changes<00:03:58.469> they

00:03:59.459 --> 00:03:59.469 
things so actual gameplay changes they

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.099 
things so actual gameplay changes they
added<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.699> ability<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.209> wear<00:04:01.359> Helms<00:04:01.719> inside

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
added the ability to wear Helms inside

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.749 
added the ability to wear Helms inside
the<00:04:02.229> game<00:04:02.379> which<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.590> just<00:04:02.919> a<00:04:03.040> huge<00:04:03.280> difference

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:03.759 
the game which is just a huge difference

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.390 
the game which is just a huge difference
from<00:04:04.150> before<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:05.169> a<00:04:05.229> quite<00:04:05.709> nice<00:04:05.889> one<00:04:06.069> people

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
from before it's a quite nice one people

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.429 
from before it's a quite nice one people
last<00:04:06.549> for<00:04:06.819> four<00:04:07.030> years<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.389> yeah<00:04:08.229> and<00:04:08.319> I've

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
last for four years and yeah and I've

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.990 
last for four years and yeah and I've
really<00:04:08.680> made<00:04:08.799> sense<00:04:09.009> before<00:04:09.250> because<00:04:09.759> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
really made sense before because the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.619 
really made sense before because the
hoods<00:04:10.870> weren't<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:12.280> telling<00:04:12.729> for<00:04:13.060> what<00:04:13.209> team

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
hoods weren't is telling for what team

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.209 
hoods weren't is telling for what team
players<00:04:13.930> are<00:04:14.079> on<00:04:14.199> as<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.500> capes<00:04:14.709> for<00:04:14.829> anyway

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.219 
players are on as the capes for anyway

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.729 
players are on as the capes for anyway
so<00:04:15.819> yeah<00:04:15.939> now<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.150> can<00:04:16.359> wear<00:04:16.509> Helms<00:04:16.810> they<00:04:17.560> also

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
so yeah now you can wear Helms they also

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.620 
so yeah now you can wear Helms they also
change<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> wait<00:04:18.519> time<00:04:18.789> from<00:04:19.000> five<00:04:19.269> minutes

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
change the wait time from five minutes

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.120 
change the wait time from five minutes
to<00:04:19.780> three<00:04:19.989> minutes<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.039> have

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
to three minutes and you have to have

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.740 
to three minutes and you have to have
two<00:04:21.340> people<00:04:21.489> per<00:04:21.760> team<00:04:21.969> in<00:04:22.180> order<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.449> start

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
two people per team in order to start

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.470 
two people per team in order to start
games<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.710> that's<00:04:23.919> another<00:04:24.250> adjustment<00:04:24.610> to

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
games so that's another adjustment to

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.150 
games so that's another adjustment to
to<00:04:25.870> prevent<00:04:26.140> people<00:04:26.530> from<00:04:26.560> boosting<00:04:27.040> it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
to prevent people from boosting it

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.070 
to prevent people from boosting it
although<00:04:27.460> as<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:27.970> mentioned<00:04:28.270> before<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.990> need

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
although as I mentioned before you need

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.780 
although as I mentioned before you need
five<00:04:29.290> people<00:04:29.590> per<00:04:29.620> team<00:04:29.920> to<00:04:30.100> get<00:04:30.190> gold<00:04:30.400> tickets

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
five people per team to get gold tickets

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.330 
five people per team to get gold tickets
so<00:04:31.000> there's<00:04:31.420> no<00:04:31.630> real<00:04:32.110> point<00:04:32.290> in<00:04:32.500> boosting<00:04:32.830> on

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
so there's no real point in boosting on

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.640 
so there's no real point in boosting on
small<00:04:33.730> teams<00:04:33.940> anyway<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.480> then<00:04:35.230> there<00:04:35.560> are<00:04:35.590> a

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
small teams anyway and then there are a

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.530 
small teams anyway and then there are a
few<00:04:35.770> other<00:04:35.950> little<00:04:36.550> adjustments<00:04:37.180> they<00:04:37.360> did

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
few other little adjustments they did

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.200 
few other little adjustments they did
and<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:38.650> put<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.490> list<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.790> those<00:04:39.940> in<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
and you put the list of those in the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.790 
and you put the list of those in the
description<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.870> connect<00:04:41.140> look<00:04:41.320> at<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.560> there

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
description to connect look at it there

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.400 
description to connect look at it there
and<00:04:42.070> then<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.970> course<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.840> probably<00:04:44.260> been

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
and then of course it's probably been

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.780 
and then of course it's probably been
pretty<00:04:44.620> obvious<00:04:45.010> from<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.400> watching<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
pretty obvious from just watching the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.130 
pretty obvious from just watching the
video<00:04:46.000> but<00:04:46.180> they<00:04:46.300> graphically<00:04:46.780> reworked

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
video but they graphically reworked

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.650 
video but they graphically reworked
everything<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:48.670> looks<00:04:48.970> quite<00:04:49.270> good<00:04:49.330> they

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
everything and it looks quite good they

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.600 
everything and it looks quite good they
did<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.930> good<00:04:50.050> job<00:04:50.110> with<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.440> yeah<00:04:51.220> they<00:04:51.400> they

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
did a good job with it yeah they they

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.040 
did a good job with it yeah they they
don't<00:04:51.970> tend<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:52.450> a<00:04:52.480> pretty<00:04:52.660> good<00:04:52.750> job<00:04:52.900> with

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
don't tend to do a pretty good job with

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.260 
don't tend to do a pretty good job with
their<00:04:53.320> graphical<00:04:53.980> updates<00:04:54.280> quite<00:04:54.730> detailed

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
their graphical updates quite detailed

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.650 
their graphical updates quite detailed
and<00:04:55.570> yeah<00:04:56.230> looks<00:04:56.950> much<00:04:57.130> better<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:58.060> that's<00:04:58.420> it

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
and yeah looks much better so that's it

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.660 
and yeah looks much better so that's it
