00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
and what I also heard is that you know

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.309 
and what I also heard is that you know
this<00:03:59.769> is<00:03:59.890> very<00:04:00.280> tight<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.720> should<00:04:01.960> like<00:04:02.080> I

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
this is very tight so you should like I

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.990 
this is very tight so you should like I
should<00:04:02.590> put<00:04:02.770> it<00:04:02.860> on<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.220> tissue<00:04:03.430> box<00:04:03.730> so

have<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:16.910> be<00:04:17.120> gold-plated<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:18.470> know<00:04:18.590> it

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
have to be gold-plated but you know it

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.289 
have to be gold-plated but you know it
could<00:04:18.799> be<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:18.949> little<00:04:19.160> more<00:04:19.280> fancier<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.090> know

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
could be a little more fancier you know

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.080 
could be a little more fancier you know
like<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.650> beats<00:04:21.829> by<00:04:21.979> dre<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.220> little<00:04:22.729> too<00:04:22.880> fancy

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
like the beats by dre a little too fancy

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.290 
like the beats by dre a little too fancy
but<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.660> know<00:04:23.889> these<00:04:24.889> are<00:04:24.949> kind<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.370> too<00:04:26.800> like

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
but you know these are kind of too like

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.670 
but you know these are kind of too like
simple<00:04:29.300> well<00:04:29.930> some<00:04:30.290> people<00:04:30.380> might<00:04:30.620> prefer

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
simple well some people might prefer

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.140 
simple well some people might prefer
this<00:04:31.130> but<00:04:31.370> yeah<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:34.280> yeah<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.910> phones

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
this but yeah and yeah the phones

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.590 
this but yeah and yeah the phones
they're<00:04:35.750> quite<00:04:36.470> durable<00:04:36.850> just<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.940> very<00:04:38.389> simple

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
they're quite durable just a very simple

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.340 
they're quite durable just a very simple
metal<00:04:39.080> band<00:04:39.880> won't<00:04:40.880> break<00:04:41.210> like<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.750> beats<00:04:41.960> by

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
metal band won't break like the beats by

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.170 
metal band won't break like the beats by
dre<00:04:42.639> pro<00:04:43.639> no<00:04:44.030> not<00:04:44.210> pros<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.800> curriculum<00:04:46.180> the

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
dre pro no not pros the curriculum the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.610 
dre pro no not pros the curriculum the
solos<00:04:47.990> or<00:04:48.380> solo<00:04:48.590> hgz<00:04:49.130> no<00:04:49.370> these<00:04:50.090> are<00:04:50.270> flexible

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
solos or solo hgz no these are flexible

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.200 
solos or solo hgz no these are flexible
but<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.770> think<00:04:51.979> they're<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> little<00:04:52.550> too<00:04:52.850> strong

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
but I think they're a little too strong

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.150 
but I think they're a little too strong
so<00:04:54.139> I'll<00:04:54.229> guess<00:04:54.410> I'll<00:04:54.530> stretch<00:04:54.830> them<00:04:55.010> out<00:04:55.100> a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
so I'll guess I'll stretch them out a

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.490 
so I'll guess I'll stretch them out a
little<00:04:55.340> bit<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.790> yeah<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:56.510> guess<00:04:56.960> that's<00:04:57.350> about

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
little bit and yeah I guess that's about

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.700 
little bit and yeah I guess that's about
it<00:04:57.650> nothing<00:04:58.580> else<00:04:58.789> in<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.090> box<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.690> yeah<00:05:00.530> it's

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
it nothing else in the box and yeah it's

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.189 
it nothing else in the box and yeah it's
