techniques as used in this particular
arrangement<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.390> our<00:00:29.630> flyaway<00:00:30.400> so<00:00:31.400> find<00:00:31.670> the

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
arrangement of our flyaway so find the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:01:02.020 
arrangement of our flyaway so find the
piece<00:00:31.970> of<00:00:32.000> music<00:00:32.270> called<00:00:32.750> our<00:00:33.080> flyaway

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.850 

you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.050 

let's<00:01:09.860> have<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.070> closer<00:01:10.310> look<00:01:10.430> at<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.760> court

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
let's have a closer look at the court

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.410 
let's have a closer look at the court
hand<00:01:13.180> okay

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
hand okay

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.570 
hand okay
lots<00:01:14.630> of<00:01:14.780> open<00:01:14.990> notes<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.710> begin<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.280> some

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
lots of open notes to begin with some

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.600 
lots of open notes to begin with some
not<00:01:16.910> much<00:01:17.120> action<00:01:17.690> for<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.380> court<00:01:18.710> hand<00:01:19.010> until

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
not much action for the court hand until

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:30.730 
not much action for the court hand until
you<00:01:20.120> get<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.720> third<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.230> fourth<00:01:21.530> measures

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.030 

as<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.100> frigid<00:01:31.520> first

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.260 

regi<00:01:35.640> second<00:01:36.980> now<00:01:37.980> you<00:01:38.040> could<00:01:38.370> think<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
regi second now you could think of the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.100 
regi second now you could think of the
construct<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.560> has<00:01:41.070> been<00:01:41.100> built<00:01:41.700> around

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
construct of that has been built around

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.370 
construct of that has been built around
the<00:01:43.110> d7<00:01:43.920> shape<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:45.180> way<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.660> hand<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> more

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the d7 shape that way your hand is more

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960 
the d7 shape that way your hand is more
likely<00:01:46.800> new<00:01:46.980> fingers<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.430> more<00:01:47.550> likely<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
likely new fingers are more likely to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.540 
likely new fingers are more likely to
fall<00:01:48.510> into<00:01:48.720> place<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.990> second<00:01:51.990> line<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.980> C

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
fall into place the second line is a C

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.880 
fall into place the second line is a C
code<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.270> put<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> whole<00:01:54.750> C<00:01:55.020> chord<00:01:55.410> on<00:01:55.620> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
code so we put the whole C chord on and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
code so we put the whole C chord on and
it's<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.430> forward<00:01:56.730> backward<00:01:57.120> roll

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.540 

okay<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.570> third<00:02:07.870> measure<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.770> line<00:02:09.040> two

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
okay the third measure of line two

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:19.790 
okay the third measure of line two
here's<00:02:10.180> that<00:02:10.450> diddly<00:02:11.350> hammer<00:02:11.710> on<00:02:12.180> face<00:02:13.180> pinch

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.220 

okay<00:02:20.800> I'll<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.070> again<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.630> far<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
okay I'll do that again so so far on the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.710 
okay I'll do that again so so far on the
second<00:02:26.650> line<00:02:26.890> from<00:02:27.220> nuts<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.700> chord<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.690> a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
second line from nuts a chord we have a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
second line from nuts a chord we have a
forward<00:02:29.110> backward<00:02:29.410> roll<00:02:29.860> twice

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.160 

last<00:02:41.450> measure<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> second<00:02:42.500> line<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.879> pH<00:02:44.170> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
last measure of the second line a pH and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.100 
last measure of the second line a pH and
I<00:02:45.319> hope<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.709> been<00:02:45.920> ghosting<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.610> too

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:02.440 

right<00:02:50.920> third<00:02:51.370> line<00:02:51.730> coming<00:02:52.360> down<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.840> strings

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.350 

just<00:03:03.080> as<00:03:03.230> they<00:03:03.379> we<00:03:03.500> did<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.920> third<00:03:04.879> measure

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
just as they we did in the third measure

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.390 
just as they we did in the third measure
of<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> first<00:03:06.050> line<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.989> we<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.400> hammer

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
of the first line and we have a hammer

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.040 
of the first line and we have a hammer
on<00:03:10.519> in<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.030> twelfth<00:03:11.420> fret<00:03:11.569> which<00:03:11.870> we

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
on in the twelfth fret which we

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:20.589 
on in the twelfth fret which we
discussed<00:03:12.530> before<00:03:17.349> first<00:03:18.349> line<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:19.599> first

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
discussed before first line of first

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.030 
discussed before first line of first
measure<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:20.959> line<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:22.150> slide<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.750> pick<00:03:24.709> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
measure of line for slide and pick the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.680 
measure of line for slide and pick the
second<00:03:25.459> string<00:03:25.700> at<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.910> same<00:03:26.120> time<00:03:26.450> as<00:03:26.599> you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
second string at the same time as you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.850 
second string at the same time as you
land<00:03:27.019> at<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.380> fourth

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.600

right now a d7 we can kind of use that

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.540 
right now a d7 we can kind of use that
second<00:03:39.880> string<00:03:40.350> second<00:03:41.350> finger<00:03:41.830> sorry<00:03:42.250> on
