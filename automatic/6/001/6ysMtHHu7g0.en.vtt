this is the powder brush the most is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.950 
this is the powder brush the most is
just<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.020> flat<00:01:58.320> top<00:01:59.280> very<00:01:59.909> dense<00:02:00.240> brush<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
just a flat top very dense brush and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.280 
just a flat top very dense brush and
I've<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.770> tried<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> use<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.700> my

and<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.860> also<00:02:04.010> think<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.760> did<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.910> really

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
and I also think that it did a really

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.000 
and I also think that it did a really
good<00:02:05.210> job<00:02:05.270> with<00:02:05.510> blending<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.290> with<00:02:06.440> my<00:02:06.710> hands

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
good job with blending in with my hands

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.380 
little too greasy and I have tried using
it<00:02:21.110> with<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> primer<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.860> use<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.400> powder<00:02:22.730> over<00:02:23.300> it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390

sweat a lot on my face sometimes and
it's<00:02:34.880> really<00:02:35.180> important<00:02:35.570> for<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.720> foundation

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
it's really important for a foundation

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.520 
it's really important for a foundation
to<00:02:36.590> hold<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> my<00:02:37.130> oily<00:02:37.730> skin<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.840> me<00:02:39.230> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
know if I sweat a little bit on my face

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.260 
know if I sweat a little bit on my face
and<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.440> don't<00:02:42.500> feel<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.730> foundation

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
and I don't feel like the foundation

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.930 
and I don't feel like the foundation
held<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:45.430> for<00:02:46.430> me<00:02:47.080> for<00:02:48.080> those<00:02:48.200> reasons<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.130> now

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
held up for me for those reasons and now

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.550 
held up for me for those reasons and now
that<00:02:50.120> I'm<00:02:50.209> reading<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.050> website<00:02:51.410> how

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
that I'm reading it on the website how

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.190 
that I'm reading it on the website how
it<00:02:51.709> has<00:02:51.830> hydrating<00:02:52.730> ingredients<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.660> nourish

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
it has hydrating ingredients to nourish

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.290 
it has hydrating ingredients to nourish
and<00:02:54.530> keep<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.190> skin<00:02:55.370> hydrated<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.090> think

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
and keep the skin hydrated I think

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.270 
and keep the skin hydrated I think
that's<00:02:56.450> what<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:57.920> really

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
that's what it is that it's not really

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.050 
that's what it is that it's not really
working<00:02:58.520> for<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:59.180> skin<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.900> think<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.920> if<00:03:01.340> it

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
working for my skin I think that if it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.820 
working for my skin I think that if it
probably<00:03:02.480> didn't<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.900> those<00:03:03.080> ingredients<00:03:03.290> I

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
probably didn't have those ingredients I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.060 
probably didn't have those ingredients I
think<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.730> would<00:03:04.880> be<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.560> home<00:03:06.560> run<00:03:06.590> I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
think that it would be a home run I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.250 
think that it would be a home run I
really<00:03:07.640> think<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.030> would<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:08.269> been<00:03:08.420> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
really think it would have been the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.470 
really think it would have been the
right<00:03:09.380> foundation<00:03:09.860> for<00:03:10.100> me<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.150> want<00:03:11.420> to
