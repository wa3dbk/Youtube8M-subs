00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.040
 languages and here we are at the airport 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.899
 between by effectively we are all 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.950
 against my mother I can not stand time is that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.830
 she who did not upload an episode of this 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.120
 series how long ago already close to a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.230
 month I think your benefit of this series 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.219
 of birds that I do not know why he has left so 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.049
 abandoned because the truth that I 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.730
 it was pretty cool like that when I eat 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 you see we are here with bar that we are 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.750
 about nine people right in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 room are eight against me and well then 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.449
 as you know for people who are 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.310
 new and do not know what the hell 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 I complain talking telling me this because 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.400
 basically what it's about is that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.080
 right now I take a motorcycle that is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 right here at the bottom of the map and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.110
 now all of them go with the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.910
 trucks made with this case are many 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 people and they have to try to throw me 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.820
 motorbike and as you see it right 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.469
 just down to the left there is a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 time marker and then well I have 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.770
 to resist that time is worth so 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.390
 let's catch and let motilla 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.100
 park these here we have to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 resist about three minutes and more peak or 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.399
 less and in these three minutes and peak 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 Well, I stay on top of the bike 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.820
 will be the winner and if they throw me 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.559
 the canary me so a beijing wins 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.149
 youtuber or subscribers now we will see 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 beyond with our supermoto that in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.910
 this case as you already know the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.199
 I put it so that it touches a color to the author and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 has touched a color between black and orange 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.199
 the candle that is pretty cool and like 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 and I am therefore always put twigs by 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.480
 here to make everything more dynamic and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.160
 such camagÃ¼ey 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.540
 so how do I say three minutes 45 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.240
 seconds that we have to resist to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 these beasts of the wolves so let's go 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.090
 butt also in finished carry 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.190
 everyone already comes all effectively 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.470
 my mother that is eight people and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 know that we have many but they are going 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.150
 with bars of these we wanted to go see 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 to which the bars as you already know are 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.610
 very big then then and also 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.930
 run yours because they are cars 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.430
 military and military cars have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370
 to be prepared to run many 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.390
 times like the one I get in here is worth 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.430
 and I think I'm going to make the mess of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.810
 give me the turns this has never done 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 it's about this we've never done but 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.170
 opinion that they are hitting Indians and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.080
 now he turned them around here and I do not know 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.820
 they wait or yes who knows how to trivia 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.750
 OK OK OK vale vale This will 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.730
 jump over marimar is already in the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.410
 first play went well or more or less 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.600
 the truth that has been point one of 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.150
 hit me a milk when I pasted the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.520
 curve is rough 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.520
 I have managed to resist here 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.110
 the limit at the beginning to the limit and arrives is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.390
 a little further away from the ramp and I 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.540
 led against ballistic care 2 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 minutes 40 seconds 2 minutes 40 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 seconds up 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.230
 perfect modern headquarters repeated I had been 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.030
 the ones that hit me with my mouth 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.170
 that mythical for now that after 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.760
 so long without uploading it there will be no 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.230
 I lose the practice and be here 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.180
 resisting pretty well enough 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.830
 try to get me in here uncle without touching me 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.920
 with no stone please is that in 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.810
 this map 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.760
 the allies come guys two minutes two 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.200
 minutes that we have to resist and this 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.580
 it is already in our hands we will be the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.920
 champions of the world of all against me 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.450
 when traveling around here this time we 're not going 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.120
 towards here from as you tour 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.480
 but I turned around and then I stay 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.480
 with them 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 and being able to live flying is that flipas of 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.510
 true this game mode is the host 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 god come on let's go let's go one minute 51 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.890
 50 minutes as is because this fate 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.150
 taking in truth even from outside 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.370
 we go watching the video it seems that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 it's not that complicated it 's complicated 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.540
 that makes that car go I 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.849
 more than it suddenly seems that more 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.860
 perfect is not totally safe and at 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.450
 second of thinking about all the bars 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.959
 above you try to doubt know 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.959

 minutes less than a minute and we'll be the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.189
 champions that is the last drift has 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.230

 I played and in the jump to see who was 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.469
 point to follow I'm stuck with 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.819
