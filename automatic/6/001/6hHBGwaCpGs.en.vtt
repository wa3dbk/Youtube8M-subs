00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 they are developing and so not complex 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:14.429
 God because they already sleep 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:16.139
 sang though not accustomed hi kids for 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 those who just want to see the guide 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 please rewind a little or press 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.850
 here on this button for the same who with us 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.650
 first 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 I am now quick to see you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 Today I decided to share with you my 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 last addiction like a friend 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 who suddenly appears and asks 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 would you like to try amphetamines 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 and you say, well, of course except that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 something can go wrong as you understood 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 from this core 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 i recently started playing dota 2 i and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
 I've heard about this game before and even spent 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 for her a couple of hours but nothing interesting 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 for myself not found however in one 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 fine evening i spontaneously decided her 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 download and after several matches me 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.219
 hooked yes of course I almost always 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.379
 merged but I liked to play 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.059
 I liked it and not so merge 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.320
 it turned out that I almost always play with 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.300
 more skillful players 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.219
 not because i'm playing with friends 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.320
 who understand dota and just 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.610
 because i'm so bad no 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.140
 seriously my presence in the game 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.790
 adds the same thing exactly 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 add to the romantic walk through 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.369
 river but hands slowly straighten 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 and matches are now much better than yes 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.570
 my meeting with dota was as much 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.490
 warm how much winter frost mountains but 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 between the cold rocks i saw something 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 beautiful gorgeous maiden whose breasts 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.490
 can withstand the weight of mount olimp but when 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 finally overtook this beautiful woman and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.030
 our lips merged in ecstasy she 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.760
 turned into a witch and infected me from 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.580
 rabies 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.500
 oh well, losing out to dota is part of 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.540
 games if someone is really better then they 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.730
 deserve a victory but i decided to change 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.590
 this terrible karma and learn to drag in 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.040
 any game 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.810
 join me in this 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.810
 the journey we start 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.210
 no matter who you are professional eSports 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.650
 just a player trying to boost his 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 skill or person who before 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.850
 never played dota you have one 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.680
 quality that determines the results 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.170
 your wayne your matches and even 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.730
 the most important events of your life today we 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.800
 talk about god complex and about 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.780
 responsibility doesn't matter 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.250
 how cool are you playing each of us 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.230
 once shifted responsibility for 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.970
 your failures on others in online games 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.650
 this behavior is very natural 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.660
 Imagine your favorite match 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.130
 multiplayer game in the same dose where 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.350
 different players compete directly and 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.660
 teams in similar games we invest 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.730
 part of their self-esteem in their his 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.340
 the outcome of the match at first glance it may 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.990
 seem strange but think why 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.600
 winning this match is so big 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.730
 value you are nothing substantial beyond 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.050
 she doesn't get the match won in 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.330
 multiplayer game do not give you anything 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.709
 real in the real world unless 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.080
 only if you are not a professional player 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.790
 made it his career more 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.650
 addition most competitive games 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.720
 like dota control victory in rank not 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.970
 gives you absolutely no advantage in 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.590
 future rounds so why are we so 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.480
 we are happy about the outcome of one match 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.580
 why is it so important for us that we 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.650
 surely won yes because you 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.730
 put a part of yourself in this match because 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.350
 that not only depends on the outcome 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.959
 result but also your sense of self 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.420
 dignity that's why merge into 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.769
 these games are so unpleasant for you 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.720
 ever lost a few 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.959
 matches in a row and felt worse 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.250
 than before and generally sat at the computer 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.650
 did you feel irritation which 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.910
 this was not these feelings arise 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.130
 because of our psychological 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.420
 interest in the outcome of the game for this 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.310
 same reason people are much easier 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.300
 finish the game session after winning 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.269
 than after losing 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.769
 you understand that already 3 o'clock in the morning but the precipitate 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.630
 after draining is so unpleasant 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.550
 what do you want him with we are a victory before 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.720
 go to sleep like 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.310
 interest makes games 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.320
 filled with sharp emotions and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.060
 cool sensations for this reason 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.140
 games remain one of the strongest 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.269
 types of entertainment 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.280
 but this dependence has an inverse 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.200
 party because of interest in 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.390
 the result is some part of us all 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.980
 time cowardly she never wants 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.230
 recognize what we are to blame for 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.150
 losing and often this happens on 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.549
 subconscious level that is, we do not 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.560
 we do it on purpose we tell ourselves 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.810
 I merged because here is that goat on 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.670
 copper did not affect with of course you need 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.920
 time to put wards or do not go so 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.690
 much ahead but then 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.630
 l didnâ€™t affect mid 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.610
 wine truth we say loers are not 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.220
 zero fed opponents and no matter what 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.870
 we pulled our waist and 2 and even if 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.019
 would we play cool it doesn't matter because 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.269
 below 1 Carmelite is not from the kids it is not 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.709
 just to protect our ga but 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.260
 subconsciously want to shift the blame 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.600
 yourself to any other factor if you 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.980
 ever said this class exercise or 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.080
 this peak is only for noobs 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.180
 then you have already experienced this effect on yourself and 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.889
 this is not the worst option 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.630
 one thing when you blame 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.580
 game developers in their inability 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.650
 balance but unfortunately too 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.270
 often in team games we are used to 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.400
 blame our topic and other people 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.260
 attempt to translate arrows to another 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.300
 human aggravates the situation for the whole 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.639
 teams and in no way increases 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.560
 chances of success ultimately people 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.300
 stupidly insult each other merge all 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.910
 match and everyone stays with feeling 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.919
 irritability and anger think players in 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.690
 dota will understand me the most interesting 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.919
 the overwhelming number of matches where people 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.930
 begin to blame each other 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.820
 really good players are often not 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.560
 react attempts to shift 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.210
 responsible for their files being initiated 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.430
 mostly people who play worse 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.560
 partners if you think about it 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.090
 certain meaning if you spent 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.890
 good match but in the end 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.640
 defeated then you can always 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.250
 tell yourself 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.140
 well, at least I alone dragged 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.120
 Your self-esteem does not risk 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.340
 be disturbed but if you played bad 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.410
 and pulled the topic to the bottom for the subconscious 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.060
 very natural to try to find any 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.039
 excuse and shift the blame on that 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.360
 anywhere except yourself 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.130
 psychological factors 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.110
 there is no better dependence on such dependence 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.340
 medication than the very control if you 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.500
 notice that you are trapped 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.910
 subconscious mind try to exhale and 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.100
 mentally take a step back from 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.169
 happening on the screen remember this 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.030
 release think what it is 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.770
 just a bunch of pixels on the monitor and what 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.720
 the results of this match will disappear as 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.970
 only you move away from the company or just 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.740
 start the next round 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.510
 surely take care of yourself is one thing and what 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.910
 do when someone else is your team 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.410
 starts behaving in a similar way 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.490
 there is always the option to press the newt button 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.889
 or leave the game 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.150
 if your nerves are more expensive ignoring the command 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.130
 which is constantly among themselves 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.660
 quarreling you are not only citizens of yourself 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.580
 from negative 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.500
 but also increase the chances of you 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.840
 will be left alone and will not get verbal 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.340
 skirmish just for god sake when you 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.660
 tell someone not to talk about it 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.640
 declare publicly 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.010
 such an act puts you on par with 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.900
 trolls when you say all dude i 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.520
 ignore the you is the same as 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.790
 would you say that this player 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.350
 but you d'artanyan I think everyone understands 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.240
 that such statements are an invitation 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.470
 attract attention and trolls 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.210
 then there is the temptation to plant sharply 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.160
 such a person said that it was he 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.880
 bad player and that he himself on you in 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.920
 own file 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.470
 Unfortunately, this approach rarely works. 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.000
 as people communicate on emotions but you 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.890
 you can always try to defuse 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.410
 the situation by transferring the venus person to 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.360
 something else in the game for example oh well 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.470
 it's not the player's fault, but about the tables in it 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.750
 patch by chur a.p. 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.970
 or we would play better if we 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.890
 also support was such an answer allows 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.290
 avoid negative and do not drive anyone into
