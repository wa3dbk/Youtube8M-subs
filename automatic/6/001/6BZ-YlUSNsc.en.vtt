00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.180 
I do admit this is pry a little too much
and<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.289> probably<00:00:49.469> put<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:49.980> bit

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and we should probably put a little bit

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.490 
and we should probably put a little bit
out<00:00:51.140> okay<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:52.410> good

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500

sugar container us really was running

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.250 
sugar container us really was running
low<00:01:51.010> so<00:01:51.370> I<00:01:51.640> pour<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.750> here<00:01:52.870> so<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.080> could

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
low so I pour it in here so I could

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.330 
low so I pour it in here so I could
reach<00:01:53.410> it<00:01:53.590> easily

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
reach it easily

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.990 
reach it easily
okay<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.840> now<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.260> that's<00:01:56.680> all<00:01:56.920> done<00:01:56.980> we<00:01:57.820> can

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
okay so now that that's all done we can

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.880 
okay so now that that's all done we can
now<00:01:58.090> stir<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.420> all<00:01:58.660> up<00:02:00.720> everything<00:02:01.720> stink<00:02:02.680> now

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
stirring because it is well after it's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.550 
stirring because it is well after it's
in<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> microwave<00:02:10.450> I'm<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.320> pop

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:57.050 
it in there so it says to put on high
for<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.500> two<00:02:20.620> minutes<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.490> think

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.870 

okay<00:02:58.920> now<00:02:59.920> stir<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.459> up<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:03.160> use<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> measuring

okay now stir it up so use a measuring
cup<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:05.019> grab<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.380> handle<00:03:05.800> it's<00:03:06.010> just

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
cup you can grab the handle it's just

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.080 
cup you can grab the handle it's just
that<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.720> sizes<00:03:08.050> what's<00:03:08.410> back<00:03:08.709> oh<00:03:09.040> well<00:03:09.910> let's
