00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.279
 in this video we are going to see the machining of a piece of nylon in a tournament 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.860
 parallel 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.719
 we start with an outbreak of material 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.969
 we want to machine according to the specifications of this plane cost 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679
 for this we use a parallel tournament 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.630
 The first step is to select the right tools 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.730
 place the piece in the machine 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 and select the epe the cities of advance of the tool and of giron of the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.240
 spindle 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.820
 The first operation that we will perform on the piece is an operation of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 reprisal 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.350
 with the network operation 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.920
 we will eliminate the excess material the front of the piece 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.860
 then we perform 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.860
 in this case the dynamo that leftover material in the longitudinal part of the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 party 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.790
 we must eliminate the minutes that are generated when we carry out this operation 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 and check that the dimensions are met 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
 then we make the cone that have the piece in the front 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 finally we made the slot 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.409
 finally we must cut the skin 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.409
 according to the length indicated in the plan 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.540
 finally the day we have our finished piece
