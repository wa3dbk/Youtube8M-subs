00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
where the person inside a dinosaur

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.250 
where the person inside a dinosaur
should<00:03:20.360> be<00:03:21.640> he<00:03:22.640> determined<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.299> exact<00:03:23.750> spot

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
should be he determined the exact spot

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.289 
should be he determined the exact spot
where<00:03:24.319> a<00:03:24.769> person<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.370> make<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.849> biggest

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
where a person can make the biggest

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.630 
where a person can make the biggest
movements<00:03:26.840> using<00:03:27.110> as<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:28.160> power<00:03:28.370> as

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
movements using as little power as

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.509 
movements using as little power as
possible<00:03:29.140> for<00:03:30.140> example<00:03:30.620> when<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.040> dinosaur

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
possible for example when the dinosaur

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.030 
possible for example when the dinosaur
moves<00:03:31.790> like<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.750> looks<00:03:33.140> as<00:03:33.320> though<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.859> is

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
moves like this it looks as though it is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.220 
moves like this it looks as though it is
swinging<00:03:34.370> its<00:03:34.670> tail<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.540> fact<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
swinging its tail but in fact the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.319 
swinging its tail but in fact the
movement<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.070> feet<00:03:37.250> creates<00:03:37.760> momentum

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
movement of the feet creates momentum

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.020 
movement of the feet creates momentum
that<00:03:38.690> causes<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> tail<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.650> swing<00:03:39.920> this<00:03:40.880> is

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
that causes the tail to swing this is

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.670 
that causes the tail to swing this is
possible<00:03:41.510> because<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> weight<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.470> tail

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
possible because the weight of the tail

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.349 
possible because the weight of the tail
is<00:03:42.890> perfectly<00:03:43.370> balanced<00:03:43.910> with<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.060> weight<00:03:44.329> of

have started out making movie sets then
one<00:04:03.889> day<00:04:04.130> he<00:04:04.519> visited<00:04:05.030> an<00:04:05.180> event<00:04:05.540> for<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> movie

one day he visited an event for a movie
about<00:04:06.500> dinosaurs

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.600 

what<00:04:09.990> he<00:04:10.110> saw<00:04:10.350> there<00:04:10.590> was<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.010> computer

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
what he saw there was a computer

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.910 
what he saw there was a computer
operated<00:04:12.210> dinosaur<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:13.110> could<00:04:13.260> only<00:04:13.470> keep

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
operated dinosaur that could only keep

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.300 
operated dinosaur that could only keep
repeating<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.580> same<00:04:14.610> movements<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:16.829> was<00:04:17.070> an

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
repeating the same movements it was an

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.740 
repeating the same movements it was an
event<00:04:17.579> with<00:04:17.760> Dinosaurs

event with Dinosaurs

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.650 
event with Dinosaurs
but<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:20.070> dinosaurs<00:04:20.579> couldn't<00:04:20.970> actually<00:04:21.180> walk

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
but the dinosaurs couldn't actually walk

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.080 
but the dinosaurs couldn't actually walk
I<00:04:22.079> would<00:04:23.040> have<00:04:23.130> deceived<00:04:23.400> something<00:04:23.790> like<00:04:23.940> in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
I would have deceived something like in

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.520 
I would have deceived something like in
the<00:04:24.180> movies<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.350> wanted<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.830> walk<00:04:25.980> around

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
the movies so I wanted it to walk around

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.870 
the movies so I wanted it to walk around
connemara<00:04:28.530> set<00:04:28.770> out<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:29.130> make<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> prototype

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
connemara set out to make a prototype

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.990 
connemara set out to make a prototype
that<00:04:30.090> looked<00:04:30.480> real

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.720 

he<00:04:35.600> decided<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.260> robot<00:04:36.770> wouldn't<00:04:37.370> be<00:04:37.490> able

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
he decided that a robot wouldn't be able

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.240 
he decided that a robot wouldn't be able
to<00:04:37.910> move<00:04:38.120> freely<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.230> he<00:04:39.380> came<00:04:39.620> up<00:04:39.680> with<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> way

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
to move freely so he came up with a way

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.980 
to move freely so he came up with a way
of<00:04:40.280> hiding<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:40.910> person<00:04:41.330> operated<00:04:41.990> from<00:04:42.230> inside

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
of hiding a person operated from inside

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.720 
of hiding a person operated from inside
development<00:04:44.990> costs<00:04:45.440> soared<00:04:45.890> as<00:04:46.220> he<00:04:46.340> devoted

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
development costs soared as he devoted

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.030 
development costs soared as he devoted
his<00:04:46.970> time<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.270> making<00:04:47.660> dinosaurs<00:04:51.040> making

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
his time to making dinosaurs making

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.040 
his time to making dinosaurs making
things<00:04:52.310> especially<00:04:52.640> dinosaurs<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:53.870> much

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
things especially dinosaurs is so much

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.570 
things especially dinosaurs is so much
fun<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.500> think<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:55.040> because<00:04:55.280> it's<00:04:55.400> like

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
fun I think it's because it's like

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.000 
fun I think it's because it's like
you're<00:04:55.730> making<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:56.120> real<00:04:56.360> living<00:04:56.720> animal<00:04:57.230> it's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
you're making a real living animal it's

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.800 
you're making a real living animal it's
my<00:04:58.190> goal<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.490> make<00:04:58.970> something<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.720> just

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
my goal to make something that is just

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.370 
my goal to make something that is just
like<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.410> real<00:05:00.680> thing

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
like the real thing

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.740 
like the real thing
connemara<00:05:03.380> created<00:05:03.980> his<00:05:04.190> own<00:05:04.490> software<00:05:05.030> and

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
connemara created his own software and

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.750 
connemara created his own software and
used<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.410> simulate<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.040> movement<00:05:07.460> of<00:05:07.610> the

dinosaur again and again he continued to

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.200 
dinosaur again and again he continued to
make<00:05:12.350> adjustments<00:05:12.530> in<00:05:13.250> an<00:05:13.430> effort<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:14.000> make

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
dinosaur video from these cameras is

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.540 
dinosaur video from these cameras is
sent<00:05:23.510> inside<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.020> dinosaur<00:05:24.320> but<00:05:25.160> we<00:05:25.310> can't

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
sent inside the dinosaur but we can't

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.460 
sent inside the dinosaur but we can't
show<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.030> either<00:05:26.390> because<00:05:27.140> it's<00:05:27.380> a

company secret to using this video the
person<00:05:30.980> inside<00:05:31.340> knows<00:05:31.640> exactly<00:05:32.120> how<00:05:32.570> far<00:05:32.930> it

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
person inside knows exactly how far it

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
so when I'm standing here the dinosaur

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.620 
so when I'm standing here the dinosaur
like<00:05:42.290> this<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:43.160> cameras<00:05:43.610> show<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.180> operator

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
like this the cameras show the operator

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.310 
like this the cameras show the operator
exactly<00:05:45.170> where<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.500> am<00:05:49.960> that's<00:05:50.960> how<00:05:51.260> the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
exactly where I am that's how the

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.770 
exactly where I am that's how the
dinosaur<00:05:51.920> is<00:05:52.040> able<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.580> wow<00:05:52.820> audiences<00:05:53.120> by

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
dinosaur is able to wow audiences by

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.940 
dinosaur is able to wow audiences by
moving<00:05:54.080> in<00:05:54.350> such<00:05:54.620> unpredictable<00:05:55.070> ways<00:05:56.950> it's

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
moving in such unpredictable ways it's

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.020 
moving in such unpredictable ways it's
not<00:05:58.130> like<00:05:58.310> we<00:05:58.430> use<00:05:58.670> any<00:05:58.910> special<00:05:59.390> technologies

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
not like we use any special technologies

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.350 
not like we use any special technologies
we<00:06:02.030> just<00:06:02.270> make<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:02.570> most<00:06:02.720> of<00:06:02.960> small<00:06:03.230> ideas

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
we just make the most of small ideas

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.390 
we just make the most of small ideas
just<00:06:05.360> a<00:06:05.540> single<00:06:05.900> small<00:06:06.200> idea<00:06:06.650> may<00:06:06.950> seem<00:06:07.190> boring

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
just a single small idea may seem boring

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.460 
just a single small idea may seem boring
but<00:06:07.850> if<00:06:08.030> you<00:06:08.240> gather<00:06:08.480> a<00:06:08.720> hundred<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.320> those

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
but if you gather a hundred of those

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.310 
but if you gather a hundred of those
ideas<00:06:09.800> you<00:06:10.660> end<00:06:11.660> up<00:06:11.840> with<00:06:12.020> something

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
ideas you end up with something

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.730 
ideas you end up with something
completely<00:06:12.950> different<00:06:14.170> that's<00:06:15.170> what<00:06:15.500> keeps

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
completely different that's what keeps

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.980 
completely different that's what keeps
me<00:06:15.860> going
