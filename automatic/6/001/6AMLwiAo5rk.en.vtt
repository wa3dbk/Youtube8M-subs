00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.129
 tutorial, I hope you enjoy it today 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.700
 I'll show you how to make a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.800
 Nail it's three colors, it 's easy to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.930
 doing this gives a little more work 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.550
 I'm sure you'll like it. 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 so come on I'll show you 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.199
 how to make this line super different and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.660
 You will need three colors of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 different enamels actually you go 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 vary the tone here I chose the rose 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.559
 so I'm going to give you a dark pink rose 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 medium and a lighter pink 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.100
 you can do with green with yellow 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.330
 with orange a color you want 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 Extra Bright Glitter Tape and Adhesive Tape 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 Durex Whatever You Have at Home Remover 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.549
 cotton enamel and toothpick also 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 then you will get your nail polish over 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.680
 dark in case I chose this one and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.829
 it will go on all your nails 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.020
 I spent two layers of herself pink more 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.110
 dark on all my nails 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.180
 I cleaned the little corners and waited to dry 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.909
 starting to do this nail is important 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.579
 that your nail polish is fine. 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.670
 so I can move my finger up that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.259
 Do not waste it, do not damage it, then it's for you. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
 Do you have to be with your mother? 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.590
 so also the effect you will get a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.180
 little piece of duct tape 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 You'll take a little bit of the glue. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.369
 so you put your hand puts tape 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.369
 adhesive over your hand and take a 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.460
 done that we'll start, I'll go 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.910
 demonstrate in this middle line here 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.850
 so here at this tip of the nail until the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.360
 nail tip here we'll create a 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.510
 line sticking tape 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.730
 There's not much secret in this part. 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.130
 so you wrap a tight 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.170
 Light 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.170
 I do not get even a little bit of air in the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.510
 tape per se does not create bubble 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.930
 Maybe it's done, I'm going. 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.760
 pick up the middle rose shade and I'll pass 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.760
 above in this space that was 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.050
 Now I'll wait a little bit for 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.080
 then strip that tape against the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.080
 10 15 seconds and removes is 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.769
 now I'm going to repeat this same process 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.480
 on all the nails 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.579
 This is going to be the time to open in this 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.769
 Monday for drought so I'll say it again 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:39.530
 here we can start from the next 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:52.849
 Step on next if you want you can already 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:56.150
 take the nooks too this second 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.280
 The color I went through is small but there. 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.430
 in the end I will pass the extra brightness and go 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.060
 It's all shining and now you're going 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.889
 wait for the middle rose to dry well 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.980
 We can do the next the last 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.989
 Step when you're already well after you 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.209
 will put the finger and will not stay the mark 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.190
 Can you do the next step then? 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:23.659
 You do the same thing with the tape. 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:26.210
 and now we're going to make 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:32.320
 new this same drawing just goes 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.320
 leave only the tip of the outside 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.080
 beyond the mark right here 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.520
 I said I'll help here 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.970
 then you give a apertadinhas not get 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.970
 on the air 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.179
 and now I'm going to spend one more rose 

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.179
 light 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.610
 now we expect to be just one 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.170
 bit and remove if you want 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.860
 cleaning the place can also 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.860
 take advantage now 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.840
 done it on all the nails you go 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.599
 expect to dry again expect to dry well 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.229
 You can then pass on your extra brightness 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:57.000
 and this end result of my 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.830
 nail with three colors of rose is unique to 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.900
 a bit of work but I think 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.159
 the result is very interesting, I 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.340
 I think it looks pretty good and that's it. 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.949
 I hope you have enjoyed my 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.590
