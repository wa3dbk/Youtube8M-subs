anyway<00:03:40.569> back<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:40.989> topic<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.950> Bell<00:03:42.250> covenant

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
anyway back on topic the Bell covenant

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.610 
anyway back on topic the Bell covenant
definitely<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.239> really<00:03:43.659> cool<00:03:43.840> covenant<00:03:44.260> it

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
definitely a really cool covenant it

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.979 
definitely a really cool covenant it
reminds<00:03:45.099> me<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> lot<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.879> the<00:03:46.360> forest<00:03:46.629> hunters

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
reminds me a lot of the forest hunters

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.170 
reminds me a lot of the forest hunters
and<00:03:47.230> that's<00:03:47.829> not<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> bad<00:03:48.310> thing<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:48.970> really

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
and that's not a bad thing it's really

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.210 
and that's not a bad thing it's really
not<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> bad<00:03:49.840> thing<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.260> like<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.709> design<00:03:51.190> of

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
not a bad thing I like the design of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.940 
not a bad thing I like the design of
this<00:03:51.579> better<00:03:52.000> than<00:03:52.239> forest<00:03:52.690> though<00:03:52.959> simply

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
this better than forest though simply

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.210 
this better than forest though simply
because<00:03:54.370> it's<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.180> smaller<00:03:55.510> area<00:03:55.920> but<00:03:56.920> it's

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
because it's a smaller area but it's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.080 
because it's a smaller area but it's
more<00:03:58.319> vertical<00:03:59.319> instead<00:03:59.769> of<00:03:59.920> horizontal<00:04:00.090> so

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
more vertical instead of horizontal so

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.550 
more vertical instead of horizontal so
you've<00:04:01.359> got<00:04:01.510> more<00:04:01.690> levels<00:04:02.079> you<00:04:02.200> got<00:04:02.319> three

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
you've got more levels you got three

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.619 
you've got more levels you got three
levels<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.190> place<00:04:03.489> with<00:04:04.239> different

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
levels to this place with different

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.080 
levels to this place with different
pitfall<00:04:05.170> areas<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.950> few<00:04:06.609> of<00:04:06.730> them<00:04:06.849> caused

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
pitfall areas a few of them caused

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.660

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
damage a few of them don't right there

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.780 
damage a few of them don't right there
that<00:04:10.269> that<00:04:10.629> happens<00:04:11.200> yeah<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.670> know<00:04:12.760> I

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
bit of an issue it's not entirely you

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.689 
bit of an issue it's not entirely you
know<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.510> deal<00:05:23.229> breaker<00:05:23.530> as<00:05:23.830> far<00:05:23.979> as<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.160> PvP<00:05:24.580> is

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.629 
know a deal breaker as far as the PvP is
concerned<00:05:25.180> but<00:05:26.139> really<00:05:26.590> that's<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:27.130> mean

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
concerned but really that's I mean

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.840 
concerned but really that's I mean
that's<00:05:27.849> annoying<00:05:28.180> more<00:05:28.599> than<00:05:28.810> any

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
that's annoying more than any

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.740 
that's annoying more than any
I<00:05:29.880> like<00:05:30.420> knowing<00:05:30.950> when<00:05:31.950> a<00:05:32.580> host<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.390> summoning

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
I like knowing when a host is summoning

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.660 
I like knowing when a host is summoning
a<00:05:33.810> phantom<00:05:34.170> so<00:05:34.410> I<00:05:34.440> can<00:05:34.740> know<00:05:34.860> how<00:05:35.070> trihard<00:05:35.580> I

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
a phantom so I can know how trihard I

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.820 
a phantom so I can know how trihard I
should<00:05:35.850> be<00:05:36.090> because<00:05:36.810> let's<00:05:37.200> be<00:05:37.290> honest<00:05:37.650> when

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
should be because let's be honest when

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.040 
should be because let's be honest when
someone<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.400> summoning<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.030> phantom<00:05:39.420> we<00:05:39.930> all

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
someone is summoning a phantom we all

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.960 
someone is summoning a phantom we all
get<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:40.410> extra<00:05:40.740> little<00:05:41.100> bit<00:05:41.280> of<00:05:41.310> trihard

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
get that extra little bit of trihard

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.570 
get that extra little bit of trihard
inspiration<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.200> us<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.710> take<00:05:44.220> them<00:05:44.340> out<00:05:44.430> as

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
inspiration in us to take them out as

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.390 
inspiration in us to take them out as
fast<00:05:44.790> as<00:05:45.030> we<00:05:45.180> possibly<00:05:45.210> can<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.470> we<00:05:47.100> all<00:05:47.220> fight

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
fast as we possibly can and we all fight

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.620 
fast as we possibly can and we all fight
differently<00:05:47.760> when<00:05:47.910> they<00:05:48.030> are<00:05:48.210> summoning<00:05:48.540> a

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
differently when they are summoning a

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.060 
differently when they are summoning a
phantom<00:05:48.990> or<00:05:49.140> when<00:05:49.320> there's<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.560> phantom<00:05:49.890> there

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
phantom or when there's a phantom there

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.260 
phantom or when there's a phantom there
it's<00:05:50.280> just<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.580> way<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.850> is

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
it's just the way it is

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.330 
it's just the way it is
because<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:51.810> can't<00:05:52.020> handle<00:05:52.230> a<00:05:52.500> lone<00:05:52.920> host<00:05:53.190> the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
because you can't handle a lone host the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.510 
because you can't handle a lone host the
same<00:05:53.520> way<00:05:53.670> as<00:05:53.940> you<00:05:54.090> would<00:05:54.120> handle<00:05:54.540> a<00:05:54.600> game<00:05:55.520> it's

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
same way as you would handle a game it's

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.940 
same way as you would handle a game it's
it's<00:05:57.000> just<00:05:57.180> it<00:05:57.510> is<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.690> way<00:05:57.870> it<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:58.020> so<00:05:58.650> you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
it's just it is the way it is so you

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.240 
it's just it is the way it is so you
know<00:05:59.150> the<00:06:00.150> ganking<00:06:00.600> can<00:06:00.810> go<00:06:00.930> both<00:06:01.500> ways<00:06:01.530> when

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
know the ganking can go both ways when

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
know the ganking can go both ways when
you're<00:06:02.400> in<00:06:02.550> this<00:06:02.730> area

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270
