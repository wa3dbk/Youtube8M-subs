 I want to draw attention to the main

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.610
 Toronto

 despite the city policy 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.850
 toronto and suburbs 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.050
 territorial is a single space 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.810
 without visible external borders 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.530
 united by common transport 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.860
 highways that is one but very large 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.090
 city 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.800
 it is also worth paying attention to 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.270
 that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.750
 what did you come to toronto 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.740
 Spain is not extreme 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.259
 it is rather alternative 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.760
 business cultural centers 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.570
 around which residential is formed 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.270
 arrays 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.560
 if in toronto the present moment 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
 living just over two million 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.250
 person 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 sense of parts that is about big toronto

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.490

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 distance from the city center dankana not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 is an indicator 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.760
 which determines the values ​​of that or 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.010
 other area 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.860
 on the contrary the most affluent part 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.610
 population 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.409
 more often 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.690
 prefer faces 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.590
 suburbs 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.930
 which is considered more prestigious and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.260
 prosperous parts 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
 big toronto 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240
 what a huge territory of the city 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.350
 including suburbs consists of separate 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 housing estates 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.560
 which is not called income 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.370
 these neighborhoods 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 population people and at the same time and social 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.099
 or ethnic group 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.700
 so everyone does not reach 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.479
 has its own special flavor 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.349
 for this reason in toronto important 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.620
 meaning is not in what suburb 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.599
 and where in the city do you live 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.159
 and in which do not go out 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.979
 all within big toronto 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.119
 there are more than two hundred or hikes 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.489
 although there is such a day but it is very difficult 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.230
 distinguishes between 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.269
 neighborhoods observed from the old 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.979
 parts of toronto 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.279
 in the suburbs such obvious 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.359
 although undoubtedly 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.359
 they are also present 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.220
 an important feature of toronto is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.030
 that this is one of them were in haiti 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.850
 Chaotic Pikul touring attitude 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.489
 cities of the world 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.679
 Canada is a strange migrant 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:55.629
 and every year 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.919
 and the population replenish hundreds of thousands of people 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.499
 from around the world 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.599
 it means neither part of the migrants settles in 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.799
 Toronto 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.319
 as a result in the city 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.419
 prices are ranges with 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.889
 the predominance of one or another ethnic 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.409
 groups 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.999
 naturally it imposes 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:11.660
 imprint 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.199
 on the specifics of a particular area 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.770
 so often with this country of districts 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.100
 which ethnic is usually indicated 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.100
 group prevails in each of them 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.269
 Now that is part of 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.609
 metropolis big toronto 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.729
 if you say proton toronto 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.219
 then it consists of six large arrays 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.509
 which until 1997 were separate 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.019
 city ​​formations 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.109
 The central part of it is that 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:44.890
 called 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.849
 in old toronto 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.240
 adjacent areas to it from the east 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.659
 have york 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.059
 out of frame 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.269
 West adjacent areas of her pk 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.479
 and and here century 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.189
 serik old toronto adjoins the area 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.589
 nose york 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.219
 all together it forms a city 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.219
 which is called toronto 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.310
 around the contour of the city of toronto 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.859
 there are large suburbs 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.639
 the most prestigious and expensive of them 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.129
 is on the series 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.409
 this is me out 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:24.969
 I personally all 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.749
 and mark 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.590
 formerly honored areas 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.610
 that's how 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.569
 her market 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.199
 Toronto is located in the west 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.090
 large suburbs 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.599
 not sweet 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.740
 where she lives 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.689
 about 700 thousand inhabitants 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:42.660
 7 year old 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.509
 located suburb Branco 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.490
 west 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.219
 suburbs ok rusal 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.039
 berlin there 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.229
 and Minsk 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.520
 so toronto 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.559
 go to the suburb peak of the ring 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.529
 and hour 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.089
 have Eugene 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.659
 and Warsaw 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.639
 I want to note 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.389
 that each area of ​​the city 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.590
 and each suburb has its own bright 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.590
 pronounced specificity 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.800
 Toronto is also a volume 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.690
 that the housing stock more parts 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.920
 consists of private one and two-story 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.059
 homes on selected sites 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.539
 and it comes not only to the suburbs 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.259
 such a pattern is observed throughout 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.749
 the city 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.749
 high-rise residential buildings until recently 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.569
 built exclusively for 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.039
 rental 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.759
 they are considered low-quality housing 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.129
 exception is 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:40.849
 high-rise condominiums 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.080
 which last years have gotten big 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.439
 popularity 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:46.669
 they are bred separate 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:47.710
 complexes 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.069
 and they are generally concentrated but 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.400
 very small areas 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.809
 shaped small companies 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.060
 in the city prevails 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.060
 low-rise buildings 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.050
 another crown feature is then 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.279
 that it occupies a very large area 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.009
 at the same time rather low density 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.210
 population 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.919
 while the city has a picturesque landscape 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.180
 as it is located 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.430
 on hilly ground 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.559
 which cut 3 children 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:18.530
 until January 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.740
 Elkhan patiently 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.980
 southern part of the city 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.589
 dance is only love use antalya 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.299
 which in essence is 

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:28.490
 freshwater by sea 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.190
 All these cities also have several 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.979
 inland lakes 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.849
 all this making toronto a spacious city 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.849
 there are many parks and a recreation area 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.110
 conclusion i would say he 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.449
 development prospects of toronto 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.389
 for a long time he was just big 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:50.520
 industrial body 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.860
 yielding on all he is real 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.050
 60s of the twentieth century 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.300
 the situation has changed 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.180
 and toronto 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.400
 became rapidly turning world 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.720
 cultural and financial and business 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.389
 Centre 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.379
 currently it is one of the largest 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.479
 megalopolis north america 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:10.699
 active in the life of the planet 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:11.770
 the most important thing 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.270
 this process is only gaining momentum 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.270
 what is the reflection of appearance 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.869
 cities 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:19.869
 which changes literally before our eyes 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.930
 more about that mail from yourself 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.400
 represents areas of the city and its 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.319
 suburbs 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.580
 I will say the next and cycle theaters 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.139
 walks in toronto 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:34.879
 on this if addressed 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:35.389
 to new meetings
