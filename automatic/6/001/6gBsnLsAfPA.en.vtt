00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
Halo franchise is so big and I think

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.240 
Halo franchise is so big and I think
people<00:03:36.630> underestimate<00:03:36.989> sometimes<00:03:37.650> house<00:03:37.889> how

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
people underestimate sometimes house how

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.050 
people underestimate sometimes house how
big<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.549> is<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.940> think<00:03:40.730> personally<00:03:41.730> for<00:03:41.790> me<00:03:42.000> I

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
big it is I think personally for me I

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.569 
big it is I think personally for me I
think<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.600> would<00:03:42.810> love<00:03:42.989> for<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:44.040> fans<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
think I would love for the fans to

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.690 
think I would love for the fans to
accept<00:03:45.329> what<00:03:46.079> we're<00:03:46.230> doing<00:03:46.470> here<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.889> what

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.930 
accept what we're doing here and what
we've<00:03:47.880> been<00:03:47.910> working<00:03:48.209> on<00:03:48.709> we're<00:03:49.709> not<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.190> think

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
we've been working on we're not I think

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.420 
we've been working on we're not I think
maybe<00:03:51.209> they're<00:03:51.420> expecting<00:03:51.840> something<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
maybe they're expecting something and I

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.160 
maybe they're expecting something and I
think<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.209> think<00:03:54.510> what<00:03:54.720> we're<00:03:54.810> doing<00:03:54.840> here<00:03:55.109> is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
think I think what we're doing here is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.059 
think I think what we're doing here is
we're<00:03:55.260> actually<00:03:55.350> we're<00:03:55.560> making<00:03:55.859> something

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
we're actually we're making something

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.619 
we're actually we're making something
that<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.459> gonna<00:03:57.030> be<00:03:57.090> different<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.420> what<00:03:57.510> these

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
that is gonna be different to what these

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:58.870 
that is gonna be different to what these
guys<00:03:57.689> are<00:03:57.900> expecting

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
guys are expecting

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.030 
guys are expecting
they<00:03:59.480> see<00:03:59.570> Master<00:04:00.020> Chief<00:04:00.260> maybe<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.920> know

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
they see Master Chief maybe you know

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.350 
they see Master Chief maybe you know
from<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.250> leaked<00:04:01.430> photograph<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.030> they<00:04:02.090> might

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
from a leaked photograph and they might

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.670 
from a leaked photograph and they might
think<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.600> entire<00:04:02.960> story<00:04:03.200> isn't<00:04:03.320> revolve

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
think the entire story isn't revolve

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.760 
think the entire story isn't revolve
around<00:04:03.830> here<00:04:04.130> when<00:04:04.960> an<00:04:05.960> actual<00:04:06.320> effect<00:04:06.560> where

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
around here when an actual effect where

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.050 
around here when an actual effect where
we're<00:04:07.040> shooting<00:04:07.310> something<00:04:07.640> that<00:04:07.820> takes

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
we're shooting something that takes

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.110 
we're shooting something that takes
place<00:04:08.330> quite<00:04:08.780> before<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.800> next<00:04:10.160> halo<00:04:10.520> game<00:04:10.760> so

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
place quite before the next halo game so

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.170 
place quite before the next halo game so
I<00:04:12.070> think<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.160> gonna<00:04:13.250> be<00:04:13.370> great<00:04:13.520> people

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
I think it's gonna be great people

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.520 
I think it's gonna be great people
haven't<00:04:14.480> really<00:04:14.750> seen<00:04:14.900> anything<00:04:15.230> like<00:04:15.260> this

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
with Halo before and I think we've ever

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.470 
with Halo before and I think we've ever
really<00:04:18.830> had<00:04:19.130> brought<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.730> know<00:04:19.820> emotion<00:04:20.390> to

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
really had brought you know emotion to

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.360 
really had brought you know emotion to
the<00:04:20.570> story<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.170> drama<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.800> people's<00:04:22.130> between

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
the story and drama and people's between

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.120 
the story and drama and people's between
a<00:04:22.430> real<00:04:22.730> lives<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.330> growing<00:04:23.480> up<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.350> think<00:04:24.470> I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
a real lives and growing up so I think I

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.950 
a real lives and growing up so I think I
think<00:04:25.490> for<00:04:25.520> me<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:25.760> would<00:04:26.150> love<00:04:26.330> people<00:04:26.360> just<00:04:26.810> to

think for me I would love people just to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.250 
think for me I would love people just to
watch<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.950> enjoy<00:04:28.040> it
