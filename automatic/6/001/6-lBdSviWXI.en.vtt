00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.810
 Rather than within the pitch 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 Again outside the pitch 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.260
 Train to go 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.480
 After all supporters are completely different 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.500
 It is within the pitch of Tteyuu players to each other 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.040
 I have the ability to show each other in play 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.720
 That's the basic, but other than that 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.370
 It is amazing to say the exchange of real-life 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.730
 And it must affect in the base 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 It is good that there is a difference in culture or a difference in words 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.860
 Secretly well 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:00.530
 I feel that I can not show my victory firmly around there 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.910
 Even if you have the ability 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.850
 I can not go out to the match 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.690
 There is a Japanese sword 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.160
 With big fish abroad 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.850
 After all, what is being done on the pitch is that there are different types of soccer between Japan and foreign soccer and soccer 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.680
 It is a soccer football with a child , so a good player after all 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.610
 That what is Tteyuu process leading up to but the evaluation is evaluated it is outside the pitch 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.110
 Japan is with Japan 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 There is no need to think in Japan, but in Japan it is necessary 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.410
 Come you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.790
 Soccer players repeatedly repeat such fine-grained play in daily practice 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.700
 I practice repeatedly 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.980
 There is I do not have all that is also contained in the team practice 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.790
 Went with a high how much aware of the practice 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.140
 Can you work on it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:58.750
 Over there already is a player right hand at all of the individual awareness 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.930
 Enter from the trap also stuck such a place myself is that I think there's Tteyuu came 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.220
 In five meters is the path Canaan 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.220
 I will stick to such a place 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.830
 Well your opponent 's speed 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.300
 While thinking about the dominant foot of allies 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 It is quite natural but 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.590
 If you can give out the pass while being aware of such things 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.250
 Is it easy for the next ally player to play? 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:32.440
 It was 5 met while finding the answer for myself 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.150
 Well, soccer has to always play in the situation where it is 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.340
 I do not think that the same situation is twice 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.330
 In it 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.319
 Where do you most dislike it? 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.240
 Where should I give him 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.380
 Say 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.260
 It is amazingly simple 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:58.920
 From it just how to look at while judging at that every moment 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.730
 To receive a pass 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.730
 And you know 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.020
 After all, when you are in the first position 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.460
 It's always a shameful press 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.270
 There are a lot of balls from the situation under which you receive 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:21.950
 It is not the Tteyuu when you get drawn in reverse 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.950
 It is a situation where you can play in the air space, so go to the brow 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.800
 I it kick even if there is a nuclear weapons 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.500
 Goalkeeper at that time 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.960
 There was no reason was anywhere into the pond but this familial did you say 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:57.660
 part There is also the situation of the wall 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:02.610
 Basically, I ca n't accept it on the floor , thinking that I'm not practicing from scratch . 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.260
 So it's a big premise, but if it kicks to a good place after all if it is read by the keeper 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.629
 Because it is often stopped 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.629
 Do you want to reverse the opponent below 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.459
 There was also when not decide the direction in which the kick to Gigi divided into uniquely 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.459
 Change the direction that comes to the last minute 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:27.550
 I don't like what I do 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:30.320
 Because things going to have to or say was the Rikyu cheers or keep thinking to say 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:36.190
 Beds live in that time 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.190
 The myself like that whether it is the choice 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.960
 I have a master 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.409
 Already or 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.539
 Network the moment the moment 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.539
 The whole thing is always moving 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:57.060
 Like the recent time, the moment does not come anymore Niro Cha 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:01.300
 Can you do the best canto for only slaves in that moment 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.630
 Basically myself that way, such a fine movement 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:10.100
 Ummm 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:15.370
 Comparatively reasonable that because it is not the better to make a feint with respect to the other party 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.370
 I try to aim for an effective frame 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.270
