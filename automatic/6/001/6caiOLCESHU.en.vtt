and<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:37.829> answer<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.280> question<00:00:38.790> let<00:00:39.000> us<00:00:39.030> start

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and to answer this question let us start

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.340 
and to answer this question let us start
with<00:00:39.540> how<00:00:40.200> each<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> them<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:41.309> made<00:00:42.350> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
would say so why don't manufacturers

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.830 
would say so why don't manufacturers
shift<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> natural<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> refined<00:01:55.740> salt
