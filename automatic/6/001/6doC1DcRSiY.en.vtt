00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.890 
do a review of it so why don't we get
started<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.470> background<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
started a little background on the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
started a little background on the
information<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> tank<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> german

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
information on the tank it was a german

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.160 
information on the tank it was a german
tank<00:00:33.120> destroyer<00:00:33.180> used<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> World<00:00:34.320> War<00:00:34.410> two

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
tank destroyer used in World War two

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
tank destroyer used in World War two
this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> ausf<00:00:37.710> g<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> later

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
this is the ausf g which was a later

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
this is the ausf g which was a later
variant<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.530> probably<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> most

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
variant it was probably the most

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.830 
variant it was probably the most
successful<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.239> widely<00:00:42.660> used<00:00:42.870> variant<00:00:43.760> so

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
successful and widely used variant so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.910 
successful and widely used variant so
why<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.200> get<00:00:46.379> start<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
why don't we just get start with the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
why don't we just get start with the
view<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.399> here's<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:48.120> comparison

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
view so here's like a little comparison

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.319 
view so here's like a little comparison
to<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> Panzer<00:00:49.410> figure<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.070> Panzer<00:00:50.940> driver

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
to a Panzer figure a Panzer driver

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.180 
to a Panzer figure a Panzer driver
figure<00:00:51.809> um<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.910> good<00:00:54.180> scale<00:00:54.510> but

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
figure um so it's really good scale but

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.939 
figure um so it's really good scale but
it's<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.789> perfect<00:00:57.270> 135th<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> think

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it's not what perfect 135th but I think

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
it's not what perfect 135th but I think
the<00:00:59.039> scales<00:00:59.340> looks<00:00:59.760> good<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.789> move<00:01:02.789> aside

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the scales looks good so move aside

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.030 
the scales looks good so move aside
yep<00:01:04.920> there's<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> front<00:01:06.860> very<00:01:07.860> cool<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:10.080> like

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
yep there's the front very cool and like

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
yep there's the front very cool and like
little<00:01:11.310> headlights<00:01:12.020> -<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.960> main<00:01:16.320> gun

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
little headlights - and the main gun

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
little headlights - and the main gun
details<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.340> nice<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:18.000> moving<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
details is nice and I'm moving on to the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.440 
details is nice and I'm moving on to the
back<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> six<00:01:22.470> road<00:01:22.770> wheels<00:01:23.450> up

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
back so that's the six road wheels up

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.370 
back so that's the six road wheels up
and<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> road<00:01:25.920> wheels<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and then the road wheels right here and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.870 
and then the road wheels right here and
then<00:01:28.700> they<00:01:29.700> tried<00:01:30.420> supporting<00:01:30.900> things<00:01:31.880> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
then they tried supporting things and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.870 
then they tried supporting things and
here's<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:34.320> nice<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.829> details

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
here's the back just nice back details

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
here's the back just nice back details
I<00:01:36.140> think<00:01:37.140> sauce<00:01:37.439> ports<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
I think sauce ports are here then the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.880 
I think sauce ports are here then the
some<00:01:41.040> boxes<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:41.970> here<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.649> nice

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

and then I backpack in the middle and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
and then I backpack in the middle and
see<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> slopes<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.880> add<00:01:48.149> more

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
destroyer so the turret doesn't actually

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.390 
destroyer so the turret doesn't actually
move<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:21.170> stationary<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.159> the<00:02:22.250> real

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
move it's stationary like on the real

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.960 
move it's stationary like on the real
thing

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
thing
