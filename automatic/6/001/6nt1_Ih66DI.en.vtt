00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
heater and we also have an air

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.860 
heater and we also have an air
conditioner<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.850> when<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.240> temperature<00:04:24.720> gets

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
conditioner so when the temperature gets

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.440 
conditioner so when the temperature gets
too<00:04:25.020> hot<00:04:25.350> we<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.340> actually<00:04:26.490> cool<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:26.940> down<00:04:26.970> try

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
too hot we can actually cool it down try

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.820 
too hot we can actually cool it down try
to<00:04:27.480> keep<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> ambient<00:04:27.990> temperature<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.710> here

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
to keep the ambient temperature in here

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.330 
to keep the ambient temperature in here
about<00:04:28.980> 80<00:04:29.460> degrees<00:04:30.110> 78-80<00:04:31.110> this<00:04:31.920> room<00:04:32.160> like

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
about 80 degrees 78-80 this room like

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.520 
about 80 degrees 78-80 this room like
all<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.610> other<00:04:32.730> one<00:04:32.970> has<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.500> heating<00:04:34.500> system

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
all the other one has a heating system

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.030 
all the other one has a heating system
using<00:04:35.160> some<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:35.940> staff<00:04:36.210> from<00:04:36.450> cocaine<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.590> as

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
using some of staff from cocaine and as

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.150 
using some of staff from cocaine and as
an<00:04:38.250> emergency<00:04:38.790> heating<00:04:39.060> system<00:04:39.480> also<00:04:40.200> some<00:04:41.040> of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
an emergency heating system also some of

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.160 
an emergency heating system also some of
staff<00:04:41.400> with<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.970> electric<00:04:42.780> radiant<00:04:43.110> heater<00:04:43.610> and

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
staff with a electric radiant heater and

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.290 
staff with a electric radiant heater and
we<00:04:46.170> also<00:04:46.320> have<00:04:46.500> an<00:04:46.830> air<00:04:46.980> conditioner<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.090> when

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
we also have an air conditioner so when

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.540 
we also have an air conditioner so when
the<00:04:48.480> temperature<00:04:48.960> gets<00:04:49.110> too<00:04:49.260> hot<00:04:49.590> we<00:04:50.400> can

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
the temperature gets too hot we can

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.860 
the temperature gets too hot we can
actually<00:04:50.730> pull<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.180> down<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.570> try<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.690> keep

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
actually pull it down and try to keep

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.690 
actually pull it down and try to keep
the<00:04:52.020> ambient<00:04:52.200> temperature<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.890> here<00:04:53.070> about<00:04:53.220> 80

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
the ambient temperature in here about 80

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.020 
the ambient temperature in here about 80
degrees<00:04:54.150> 78
