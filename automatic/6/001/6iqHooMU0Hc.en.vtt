can't be around the test beds yeah you
need<00:01:48.399> one<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.550> those<00:01:48.670> phantom<00:01:49.210> keyboards<00:01:49.750> that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
need one of those phantom keyboards that

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.139 
need one of those phantom keyboards that
they<00:01:50.110> came<00:01:50.289> out<00:01:50.470> with<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:51.340> phantom<00:01:51.670> keyboards

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
they came out with the phantom keyboards

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.760 
they came out with the phantom keyboards
yeah<00:01:52.690> yeah<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.140> was<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.350> one<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.619> had<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
yeah yeah it was the one that had the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.590 
yeah yeah it was the one that had the
integrated<00:01:54.399> listen<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:57.700> right<00:01:57.789> so<00:01:58.179> let's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
integrated listen all right so let's

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.339 
integrated listen all right so let's
bring<00:01:58.780> up<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.929> framerate<00:01:59.259> so<00:01:59.950> ctrl<00:02:00.490> R<00:02:01.050> so<00:02:02.050> this

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
bring up the framerate so ctrl R so this

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.859 
bring up the framerate so ctrl R so this
is<00:02:02.530> 1920<00:02:02.920> by<00:02:03.280> 1080<00:02:04.289> this<00:02:05.289> is<00:02:05.500> 1/4<00:02:06.239> Nvidia<00:02:07.239> 450

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.520 
processor
alright<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.010> loads<00:02:15.370> let's<00:02:15.819> here<00:02:16.030> we<00:02:16.090> do

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.670 

when<00:02:21.530> are<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.770> DX<00:02:22.040> nine<00:02:22.280> or<00:02:22.430> eleven

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
when are you and DX nine or eleven

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.260 
when are you and DX nine or eleven
because<00:02:24.680> you're<00:02:24.950> getting<00:02:25.070> two<00:02:25.280> lemons

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:41.760 

advanced<00:02:31.420> ex9<00:02:34.600> there's<00:02:35.600> some<00:02:35.720> change

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.070 

that's<00:02:42.770> right<00:02:43.300> believe<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.390> or<00:02:44.450> not<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.840> makes

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
that's right believe it or not it makes

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.630 
that's right believe it or not it makes
a<00:02:45.230> difference<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.740> frame<00:02:45.920> rate<00:02:46.130> depending<00:02:46.520> on

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
a difference in frame rate depending on

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.809 
a difference in frame rate depending on
your<00:02:46.730> video<00:02:46.940> card<00:02:47.150> still

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.199 

but<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.510> capable<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.519> what<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:55.730> came<00:02:55.879> in

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
but it's capable this is what we came in

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.720 
but it's capable this is what we came in
now<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.890> actually<00:02:57.890> Warcraft<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.579> its

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
now the actually Warcraft on its

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.890 
now the actually Warcraft on its
higher-end<00:03:01.569> configuration<00:03:02.569> it's<00:03:02.689> really

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
higher-end configuration it's really

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.390 
higher-end configuration it's really
dependent<00:03:03.109> upon<00:03:03.319> texture<00:03:03.890> memory<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.250> you

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
dependent upon texture memory so you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.789 
dependent upon texture memory so you
actually<00:03:04.549> need<00:03:05.260> actually<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> lot<00:03:06.469> more<00:03:06.500> memory

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
actually need actually a lot more memory

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.860 
actually need actually a lot more memory
than<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.189> what<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.489> thing<00:03:07.700> really<00:03:07.909> has<00:03:08.540> I

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
than that what this thing really has I

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.410 
than that what this thing really has I
thought<00:03:09.769> about<00:03:09.859> putting<00:03:10.010> my<00:03:10.310> 580<00:03:10.819> that<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.150> used

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
thought about putting my 580 that I used

thought about putting my 580 that I used
I<00:03:11.599> think<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.200> would<00:03:12.290> be<00:03:12.319> overkill<00:03:12.939> in<00:03:13.939> this

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
I think that would be overkill in this

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:23.800 
I think that would be overkill in this
demo<00:03:19.329> but<00:03:20.329> for<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.400> 1.2<00:03:23.000> +<00:03:23.329> Giga<00:03:23.569> Hertz

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810
