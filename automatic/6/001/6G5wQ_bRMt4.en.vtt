years ago is a 815 million dollar market

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.640 
years ago is a 815 million dollar market
you<00:03:26.600> look<00:03:26.750> at<00:03:26.900> what's<00:03:27.080> going<00:03:27.140> on<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.620> world

you look at what's going on in the world
price<00:03:28.160> point<00:03:28.490> in<00:03:28.640> career<00:03:28.880> etc<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:30.050> billion

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
price point in career etc it's a billion

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.210

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.830 
dollars day one on an annualized basis
and<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:35.540> think<00:03:35.959> over<00:03:36.140> time<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:38.120> once<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.750> know

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
and I think over time if once you know

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.150 
and I think over time if once you know
the<00:03:38.930> next<00:03:39.080> step<00:03:39.170> here<00:03:39.470> is<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.620> get<00:03:39.830> this<00:03:39.980> free

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
the next step here is to get this free

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.460 
the next step here is to get this free
trade<00:03:40.430> agreement<00:03:40.850> past<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.140> is<00:03:42.320> going

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
trade agreement past that this is going

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.410 
trade agreement past that this is going
to<00:03:42.530> be<00:03:43.780> easily<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.410> biggest<00:03:46.150> bilateral<00:03:47.150> free

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
to be easily the biggest bilateral free

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.120 
to be easily the biggest bilateral free

do<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.360> would<00:03:53.540> argue<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:54.110> because

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
do it's I would argue that it's because

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.410 
do it's I would argue that it's because
of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> tariff<00:03:55.100> percentage<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.730> etc<00:03:56.000> it's<00:03:56.330> a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
of the tariff percentage and etc it's a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.570 
of the tariff percentage and etc it's a
bigger<00:03:56.959> deal<00:03:57.080> for<00:03:57.590> us<00:03:57.680> than<00:03:57.860> even<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.220> deal<00:03:58.400> with

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
bigger deal for us than even a deal with

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.290 
bigger deal for us than even a deal with
Japan<00:03:58.910> would<00:03:59.060> be<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:00.190> at<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.400> point<00:04:01.700> this

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
Japan would be and at that point this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.630
