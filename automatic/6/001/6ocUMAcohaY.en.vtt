00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
and it's so easy because you just use a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.170 
and it's so easy because you just use a
heart<00:05:39.560> cutter<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.130> punch<00:05:40.490> out<00:05:40.700> a<00:05:40.730> whole<00:05:41.000> heap

of hearts and then stick them on and a
little<00:05:44.210> bit<00:05:44.300> time-consuming<00:05:44.510> but<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.380> think<00:05:45.770> it

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
little bit time-consuming but I think it

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.780 
little bit time-consuming but I think it
looks<00:05:46.040> so<00:05:46.250> cute

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790
