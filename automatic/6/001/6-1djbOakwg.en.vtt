thing that a lot of people don't think

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.890 
thing that a lot of people don't think
of<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> first<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.660> clamp

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
of it first is that you want the clamp

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.470 
of it first is that you want the clamp
field<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.410> accessible<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> next<00:01:50.580> time

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:25.780 

I'm<00:01:54.480> very<00:01:54.750> smart<00:01:54.900> shut<00:01:55.410> up

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.309 

I<00:02:25.819> don't<00:02:26.330> think<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.569> can<00:02:26.720> see<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.989> from<00:02:27.050> there

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319
