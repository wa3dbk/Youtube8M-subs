00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 Ah 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.670
 4000 I already wondered in a year 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.020
 this will end up in this 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.180
 thomas for last years is what we do 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.279
 Here discipline organize together one 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.680
 few beats and ok well apparently world 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:36.160
 not saying it is possible is quite full 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.880
 lights and you will not be very bad 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.880
 but you 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.469
 yes ok i 'll take you to the beach 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:55.870
 cleaner 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:57.730
 so when you come plastic is hanging there 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.449
 plastic is quite the day but 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.640
 actually it is also a bad place 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.390
 Sometimes such is it is not good for it 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.869
 environmental benefits of classics and thanks 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.490
 you 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.130
 for example, nice things can be done 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.200
 toys and trays 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 you can do more in it i can do one 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.130
 make nice things 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.659
 you have to take everything to find one 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.899
 number of things you should look at like 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:34.590
 something is what i read on a pole higher 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.590
 laid but he lay 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 why it's important to sprout it 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.250
 Locks were different and the sea blowing and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.939
 that you are there and then the bottles can be there 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.939
 a stabbing 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.680
 drive to clean the beach because 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.780
 otherwise the birds might think that 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.780
 it's a joke to get caught in it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 no you think and you discover 2 kilos at 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.040
 one picked up 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.400
 Ancient quiet with jerry and what can 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.239
 i do 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.549
 subject the waste 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.670
 I like what 's going on with adults 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.680
 and children walk 10 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.480
 the good for us could be okay 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.200
 give it to children among you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.200
 do n't really understand yet 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.140
 I think it is very important that we as 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.090
 roses people not a dirty world 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.560
 Leave it for our kids on that 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.760
 must it then clean up our mess 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.760
 we don't think it's a good idea 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.670
 the adults would have had the children 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.269
 actually have to learn because crops 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.910
 they know what they know 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.180
 able to throw and I think that was too 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.610
 fit as everyone throw plastic lens 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.280
 in the seat and because it's never you 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.360
 decays that I think that of giving 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.360
 and followed in the world
