got deleted off my computer somehow and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
got deleted off my computer somehow and
so<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.460> made<00:00:33.210> me<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.690> able

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so that kind of like made me not be able

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.180 
so that kind of like made me not be able
to<00:00:33.870> compress<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.140> videos<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.620> tried<00:00:34.829> using<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to compress my videos I tried using the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.560 
to compress my videos I tried using the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
other ones accepted it didn't work that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
other ones accepted it didn't work that

wriggling<00:03:03.340> matters<00:03:03.730> because<00:03:04.000> if<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:05.560> you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
wriggling matters because if you if you

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.230 
wriggling matters because if you if you

I I killed his he's he's actually gone
slowly<00:04:21.209> but<00:04:21.600> surely<00:04:21.930> going<00:04:22.079> lower<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.470> lower

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670

he is making more Marines but keep in
mind<00:04:24.900> he<00:04:25.200> has<00:04:25.290> very<00:04:25.500> little<00:04:25.650> mining<00:04:25.950> right<00:04:26.190> now

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
mind he has very little mining right now

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.960 
mind he has very little mining right now
and<00:04:26.850> now<00:04:27.090> again<00:04:28.020> two<00:04:28.530> Marines<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.550> zerglings

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
and now again two Marines to zerglings

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.970 
and now again two Marines to zerglings
and<00:04:30.270> two<00:04:30.990> more<00:04:31.169> coming<00:04:31.350> in<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.590> didn't<00:04:31.770> want<00:04:31.919> to

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
and two more coming in I didn't want to

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.230 
and two more coming in I didn't want to
make<00:04:32.070> these<00:04:32.220> two<00:04:32.430> zerglings<00:04:32.760> engage<00:04:33.060> that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
make these two zerglings engage that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.490 
make these two zerglings engage that
marine<00:04:33.450> because<00:04:33.630> they<00:04:33.720> were<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.870> little<00:04:34.050> life

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
marine because they were a little life

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.560 
marine because they were a little life
and<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.830> needed<00:04:35.010> them<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.520> again<00:04:36.270> we're<00:04:36.419> both

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and I needed them and again we're both

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.690 
and I needed them and again we're both
Mike<00:04:36.780> really<00:04:36.960> well<00:04:37.380> i'm<00:04:37.919> not<00:04:38.130> saying<00:04:38.340> as<00:04:38.430> micro

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
Mike really well i'm not saying as micro

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.280 
Mike really well i'm not saying as micro
bad<00:04:38.880> or<00:04:39.030> anything<00:04:39.060> i'm<00:04:39.419> not<00:04:39.570> saying<00:04:39.750> Mike<00:04:39.990> well

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
bad or anything i'm not saying Mike well

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.230 
bad or anything i'm not saying Mike well
both<00:04:40.889> of<00:04:41.040> our<00:04:41.130> microbes<00:04:41.490> are<00:04:41.610> all<00:04:41.790> right<00:04:42.060> and

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
both of our microbes are all right and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.340 
both of our microbes are all right and
neither<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.660> us<00:04:42.870> are<00:04:42.960> occurring

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
neither of us are occurring

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.620 
neither of us are occurring
exceptionally<00:04:44.010> well<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.490> my<00:04:45.210> micro<00:04:45.510> is

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
exceptionally well but my micro is

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.330 
exceptionally well but my micro is
superior<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.260> little<00:04:46.530> bit<00:04:46.620> superior<00:04:46.889> than<00:04:47.130> is

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
superior a little bit superior than is

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.760 
superior a little bit superior than is
and<00:04:47.550> that's<00:04:48.060> what<00:04:48.180> costumes<00:04:48.540> AGG<00:04:49.169> so<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.620> is

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
and that's what costumes AGG so this is

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.380 
and that's what costumes AGG so this is
over<00:04:50.040> that's<00:04:50.550> how<00:04:50.669> you<00:04:50.700> do<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> for<00:04:51.180> pool

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
over that's how you do a for pool

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.510 
over that's how you do a for pool
besides<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.260> over<00:04:52.650> toward<00:04:52.830> thing<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.250> made<00:04:53.400> at

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
besides that over toward thing I made at

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.920 
besides that over toward thing I made at
the<00:04:53.610> starting<00:04:53.940> this<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.210> how<00:04:54.360> pretty<00:04:54.810> much

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
the starting this is how pretty much

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.200 
the starting this is how pretty much
it's<00:04:55.110> done<00:04:55.320> nothing<00:04:56.040> too<00:04:56.220> special<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.880> it's

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
it's done nothing too special to it it's

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.090 
it's done nothing too special to it it's
pretty<00:04:57.330> much<00:04:57.450> comes<00:04:57.660> out<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> micro<00:04:58.230> again<00:04:58.919> the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
pretty much comes out to micro again the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.320 
pretty much comes out to micro again the
best<00:04:59.280> way<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.550> him<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.669> defend<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.120> was

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
best way for him to defend this was

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.580 
best way for him to defend this was
rather<00:05:00.540> than<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.810> second<00:05:01.110> beer<00:05:01.230> hats<00:05:01.410> which

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
rather than that second beer hats which

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.320 
rather than that second beer hats which
I<00:05:01.680> still<00:05:01.919> have<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.220> which<00:05:02.760> I<00:05:02.880> still<00:05:03.090> didn't

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
I still have it which I still didn't

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.690 
I still have it which I still didn't
notice<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.780> right<00:05:04.110> now<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:05.370> best<00:05:05.520> thing<00:05:05.580> you

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
notice to right now the best thing you

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.640 
notice to right now the best thing you
could<00:05:05.880> have<00:05:05.910> done<00:05:06.000> was<00:05:06.150> make<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.630> bunker<00:05:07.230> and<00:05:07.410> a

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
could have done was make a bunker and a

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.920 
could have done was make a bunker and a
bunker<00:05:07.950> in<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.100> or<00:05:08.610> even<00:05:09.060> near<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.390> mineral

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
bunker in the or even near the mineral

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.840 
bunker in the or even near the mineral
line<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.350> all<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:10.950> need<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.250> stop<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.490> zergling

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
line is all you need to stop a zergling

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.760 
line is all you need to stop a zergling
rush<00:05:11.970> because<00:05:12.240> one<00:05:12.479> room<00:05:12.720> inside<00:05:13.169> one<00:05:13.410> bunker

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
rush because one room inside one bunker

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.010 
rush because one room inside one bunker
is<00:05:13.890> pretty<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.370> exactly<00:05:14.790> all<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.150> need<00:05:15.330> to

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
is pretty is exactly all you need to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.110 
is pretty is exactly all you need to
defend<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.470> for<00:05:16.650> pool<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.130> that's<00:05:17.850> pretty<00:05:18.000> much

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
defend a for pool and that's pretty much

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.580 
defend a for pool and that's pretty much
