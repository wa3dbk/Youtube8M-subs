but<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.010> perfect<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.520> my<00:00:41.850> fifties<00:00:42.390> kind<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
but it's perfect for my fifties kind of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.529 
but it's perfect for my fifties kind of
style<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> 50s<00:00:44.969> rockabilly

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
is exactly what I think a Telecaster
