doing on the bottom rooms copy that but
on<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.690> top<00:03:51.900> rules<00:03:52.169> don't<00:03:52.409> do<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:52.919> because<00:03:53.069> I

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
on the top rules don't do that because I

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.800 
on the top rules don't do that because I
just<00:03:53.430> mess<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.609> up<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.940> had<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.150> go<00:03:54.239> back<00:03:54.419> and

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
rebuild some of it because the creeper

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.539 
rebuild some of it because the creeper
face<00:03:57.419> looked<00:03:57.720> even<00:03:58.019> more<00:03:58.049> stupid<00:03:58.979> before<00:03:59.220> this

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
face looked even more stupid before this

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.129

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
so just repeat what I've done here at

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.689 
so just repeat what I've done here at
the<00:04:04.290> bottom<00:04:04.440> all<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.220> way<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.609> top

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
the bottom all the way up to the top

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.990 
the bottom all the way up to the top
even<00:04:06.180> if<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.389> don't<00:04:06.569> want<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.810> put<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.959> person

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
and not row just do it anyway because it

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.939 
and not row just do it anyway because it
makes<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.549> lot<00:04:11.760> easier<00:04:12.229> but<00:04:13.229> you<00:04:13.260> can<00:04:13.530> change<00:04:13.709> it

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
makes a lot easier but you can change it

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.199 
makes a lot easier but you can change it
later<00:04:13.979> to<00:04:14.340> something<00:04:14.639> else<00:04:14.849> a<00:04:14.940> few<00:04:15.060> really

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
later to something else a few really

and<00:04:37.380> also<00:04:37.740> another<00:04:38.040> problem<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.639> since<00:04:39.470> rates

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
and also another problem is since rates

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.420 
and also another problem is since rates
only<00:04:40.710> stretches<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.580> far<00:04:42.949> you<00:04:43.949> can<00:04:44.100> get<00:04:44.220> some

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
only stretches so far you can get some

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.719 
only stretches so far you can get some
problems<00:04:44.910> with<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:46.470> later<00:04:46.710> rooms<00:04:46.949> just<00:04:47.130> pyron
