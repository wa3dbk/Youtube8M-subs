 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.710
 use a useful mounts clutches to 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.870
 facilitate the task of assembling 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.179
 Clutches of classic or standard type 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.519
 those that have the club and the dock 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.110
 linked to the flywheel by inertia 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.600
 Pressure 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.940
 There are many designs of various brands of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.170
 this tool and each one incorporates 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.440
 the accessories you deem convenient 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.190
 there are those who for example only bring this 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.130
 piece that really is the important thing what 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.340
 that it would be a kind of footwear with the 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.230
 which will take off the spring of the nut 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.590
 of tightening to facilitate the insertion 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.200
 of the mass on the pin then there are others that 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.080
 like this one they have a part that 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.090
 used to press the mass e 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.090
 enter it more easily and another 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.850
 to extract the dough with this kind of 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.850
 hook that has there what happens is that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.420
 these accessories are not so universal 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.869
 as the shoehorn the hunter does not fail like that 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.270
 that to mount it we only have to 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:13.290
 locate the mace with its dock 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.020
 on the pin where we will place it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.689
 and once it's inserted 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.820
 we use the gray area of the 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.810
 tool as footwear 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.570
 we introduce it past the pier inside 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.570
 of the crankshaft and turn 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.370
 when turning the spring it has separated from the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.620
 nut and all that's left is to press 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.170
 we can do with our fingers with some 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.090
 tool or with the accessories that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 incorporates this riding tool 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.540
 clutch 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.670
 in this way it is perfectly assembled 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.670
 with the other two we will repeat the process 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.290
 ah 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.940
 here being the last one is usually a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.220
 bit harder and if it can come well to use 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.349
 some of the accessories to press 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.349
 the dough and insert it 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.689
 and ready with this we have mounted the 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.680
 maces of a standard clutch with their 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:05.430
 springs using the tool to 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 mount clutch 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.820
