it's<00:03:08.010> pretty<00:03:08.069> much<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.489> same<00:03:08.519> as<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.390> in

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
it's pretty much the same as it is in

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.170 
it's pretty much the same as it is in
four<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.739> five<00:03:11.010> which<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.430> awesome<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.030> not

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
four to five which is awesome if not

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.430 
four to five which is awesome if not
earlier<00:03:12.450> assists<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.049> traction<00:03:13.290> control

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
earlier assists and traction control

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.160 
earlier assists and traction control
stability<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.489> braking<00:03:15.209> assists<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.900> you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
stability and braking assists if you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.229 
stability and braking assists if you
want<00:03:16.410> them<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.640> have<00:03:17.730> full<00:03:17.970> braking

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
want them so you can have full braking

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.059 
want them so you can have full braking
and<00:03:18.540> such<00:03:18.720> I'm<00:03:18.930> gonna<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.590> about<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.889> same

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
and such I'm gonna have about the same

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.430 
and such I'm gonna have about the same
as<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.549> reports<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.389> five<00:03:21.630> where<00:03:22.230> it's

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
as I do on reports of five where it's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.170 
as I do on reports of five where it's
pretty<00:03:22.650> much<00:03:22.769> everything<00:03:23.069> off<00:03:23.310> except<00:03:23.609> abs

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
pretty much everything off except abs

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.020 
pretty much everything off except abs
and<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:25.620> damage<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.310> actually<00:03:26.700> pretty<00:03:26.850> cool

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
and the damage is actually pretty cool

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.599 
and the damage is actually pretty cool
it's<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.269> tire<00:03:27.569> wear<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:28.079> well<00:03:28.319> now<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.459> what

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
it's not tire wear as well now from what

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.610 
it's not tire wear as well now from what
I<00:03:29.639> remember<00:03:29.730> what<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.989> didn't<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.440> have

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
I remember what if I didn't really have

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.699 
I remember what if I didn't really have
tire<00:03:32.190> wear<00:03:32.549> in<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.239> sense<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.720> literally

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
tire wear in the sense of literally

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.440 
tire wear in the sense of literally
getting<00:03:35.069> rid<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.430> tires<00:03:35.639> completely<00:03:36.209> save

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
getting rid of the tires completely save

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.960 
getting rid of the tires completely save
GranTurismo<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:37.739> I'm<00:03:37.859> I'm<00:03:38.130> assuming<00:03:38.760> it's

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
GranTurismo but I'm I'm assuming it's

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.759 
GranTurismo but I'm I'm assuming it's
gonna<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.450> something<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.350> from<00:03:40.560> what

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
gonna have something like that from what

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.680 
gonna have something like that from what
it<00:03:40.889> says<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.700> could<00:03:41.940> be<00:03:42.090> completely<00:03:42.540> wrong

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
it says that I could be completely wrong

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.300 
it says that I could be completely wrong
and<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.139> could<00:03:43.350> be<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.620> missing<00:03:44.010> because<00:03:44.160> I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
and I could be just missing because I

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.370 
and I could be just missing because I
never<00:03:44.579> really<00:03:44.850> changed<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.299> option<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.260> you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
never really changed that option but you

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.660 
never really changed that option but you
understand<00:03:46.709> what<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.859> mean<00:03:47.069> there<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> think

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
understand what I mean there I think

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.009 
understand what I mean there I think
it's<00:03:47.790> pretty<00:03:47.970> cool<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.180> you're<00:03:48.389> able<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.690> do

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
it's pretty cool that you're able to do

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.140 
it's pretty cool that you're able to do
all<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.590> assists<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.250> such<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.639> an<00:03:50.819> open

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
all the assists and such in an open

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.759 
all the assists and such in an open
world<00:03:51.299> raising<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.690> because<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.930> very<00:03:52.230> often<00:03:52.380> in

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
world raising it because I very often in

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.379 
world raising it because I very often in
open-world<00:03:53.220> racing<00:03:53.310> games<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.180> get

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
open-world racing games you do get

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.599 
open-world racing games you do get
settings<00:03:55.019> not<00:03:55.590> most<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:55.950> time<00:03:56.100> most<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.489> time

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
settings not most of time most of time

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.789 
settings not most of time most of time
you<00:03:56.849> don't<00:03:57.480> get<00:03:57.720> settings<00:03:58.109> but<00:03:58.260> when<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.590> do

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
you don't get settings but when you do

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.190 
you don't get settings but when you do
get<00:03:59.040> them<00:03:59.220> it's<00:03:59.639> very<00:03:59.760> much<00:04:00.090> like<00:04:00.120> changing<00:04:01.109> it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
get them it's very much like changing it

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.530 
get them it's very much like changing it
from<00:04:01.410> easy<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:02.130> hard<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.910> sort<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.209> thing<00:04:03.420> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
from easy to hard that sort of thing and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.059 
from easy to hard that sort of thing and
I<00:04:04.019> could<00:04:04.170> understand<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.650> concept<00:04:05.010> behind

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
I could understand the concept behind

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.559 
I could understand the concept behind
that<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.670> doesn't<00:04:05.910> show<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> details

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
that but it doesn't show you the details

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.809 
that but it doesn't show you the details
or<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.780> traction<00:04:07.530> control<00:04:07.670> completely<00:04:08.670> off

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
or the traction control completely off

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.210 
or the traction control completely off
or<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.239> slightly<00:04:09.569> off<00:04:09.780> for<00:04:10.200> whatever<00:04:10.829> but

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
or is it slightly off for whatever but

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.759 
or is it slightly off for whatever but
obviously<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.450> other<00:04:12.720> games<00:04:13.169> they're<00:04:13.650> not

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
obviously with other games they're not

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.250 
obviously with other games they're not
really<00:04:13.919> based<00:04:14.160> around<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.849> full-on<00:04:15.260> simulation

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
really based around a full-on simulation

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
really based around a full-on simulation
driving<00:04:16.769> model<00:04:17.039> whereas<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.549> kind<00:04:18.060> of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
driving model whereas this is kind of

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150 
driving model whereas this is kind of
taking<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.599> simulation<00:04:19.169> model<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.650> made<00:04:20.130> a

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
taking the simulation model and made a

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.610 
taking the simulation model and made a
bit<00:04:20.459> more<00:04:20.669> fun<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:20.970> light<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.510> easy<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.320> get

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
bit more fun and light and easy to get

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.680 
bit more fun and light and easy to get
into<00:04:22.770> kind<00:04:23.099> of<00:04:23.220> thing<00:04:23.400> because<00:04:23.729> well-thought

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
into kind of thing because well-thought

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.659 
into kind of thing because well-thought
set<00:04:24.990> itself<00:04:25.470> isn't<00:04:25.710> really<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:26.220> hardcore

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
set itself isn't really a hardcore

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.750 
set itself isn't really a hardcore
simulator<00:04:27.150> but

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
simulator but

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.630 
simulator but
still<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.750> know<00:04:28.840> got<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.080> good<00:04:29.410> driving<00:04:29.800> system

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
still you know got a good driving system

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.060 
still you know got a good driving system
and<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.750> make<00:04:31.870> them<00:04:32.080> even<00:04:32.320> more<00:04:32.620> fun<00:04:32.860> in<00:04:32.980> this

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
and to make them even more fun in this

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.530 
and to make them even more fun in this
game<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.490> got<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.700> match<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.090> type<00:04:34.360> of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
game it's got to match this type of

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.970 
game it's got to match this type of
roads<00:04:34.750> gonna<00:04:34.930> match<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.440> ability<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.800> go

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
roads gonna match the ability to go

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.800 
roads gonna match the ability to go
off-road<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.670> fling<00:04:37.000> these<00:04:37.150> cars<00:04:37.450> everywhere

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
off-road and fling these cars everywhere

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.570 
off-road and fling these cars everywhere
in<00:04:37.870> smash<00:04:38.200> into<00:04:38.440> traffic<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.130> lots<00:04:39.460> of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
in smash into traffic and just lots of

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.180 
in smash into traffic and just lots of
other<00:04:39.730> stuff<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.120> well<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.170> think<00:04:41.560> that

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
other stuff as well so I think that

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.100 
other stuff as well so I think that
having<00:04:42.820> all<00:04:42.940> those<00:04:43.060> options<00:04:43.510> there<00:04:43.960> is

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
having all those options there is

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.860 
having all those options there is
absolutely<00:04:45.100> awesome<00:04:45.730> so<00:04:46.450> something<00:04:46.810> I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
absolutely awesome so something I

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.540 
absolutely awesome so something I
haven't<00:04:47.080> heard<00:04:47.200> mentioned<00:04:47.830> before<00:04:48.130> or<00:04:48.370> even

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
haven't heard mentioned before or even

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.240 
haven't heard mentioned before or even
discussed<00:04:49.270> ever<00:04:49.590> anywhere<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.950> think<00:04:51.160> on

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
discussed ever anywhere you can think on

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.370 
discussed ever anywhere you can think on
articles<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.790> such<00:04:51.940> as<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.360> perk<00:04:52.690> system<00:04:53.230> is

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
articles and such as a perk system is

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.310 
articles and such as a perk system is
included<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.460> game<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.300> actually<00:04:56.080> see

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
included in the game so you actually see

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.020 
included in the game so you actually see
here<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.740> start<00:04:57.010> with<00:04:57.160> one<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.490> can't<00:04:57.820> choose

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
here you start with one you can't choose

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.610 
here you start with one you can't choose
any<00:04:58.210> other<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.900> getting<00:04:59.170> this<00:04:59.260> kind<00:04:59.320> of<00:04:59.500> an

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
any other and getting this kind of an

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.420 
any other and getting this kind of an
introduction<00:04:59.950> because<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.280> has<00:05:00.400> a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
introduction because it has a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.310 
introduction because it has a
speakerphone<00:05:00.910> in<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.240> bottom<00:05:01.840> corner<00:05:02.200> so

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
speakerphone in the bottom corner so

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.390 
speakerphone in the bottom corner so
she's<00:05:02.530> probably<00:05:02.620> saying<00:05:03.010> something<00:05:03.220> like

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
she's probably saying something like

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.800 
she's probably saying something like
here<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:03.790> can<00:05:03.940> choose<00:05:04.150> this<00:05:04.390> blah<00:05:04.540> blah<00:05:04.660> blah

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
here you can choose this blah blah blah

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.140 
here you can choose this blah blah blah
so<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.500> perk<00:05:05.680> will<00:05:05.830> basically<00:05:06.010> allow<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.610> to

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
so this perk will basically allow you to

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.210 
so this perk will basically allow you to
get<00:05:07.420> xp<00:05:07.870> for<00:05:07.900> doing<00:05:08.380> things<00:05:08.620> like<00:05:08.680> drifting

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
get xp for doing things like drifting

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.250 
get xp for doing things like drifting
and<00:05:09.340> power<00:05:09.460> sliding<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.000> whatever<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:11.140> then

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
and power sliding and whatever and then

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.290 
and power sliding and whatever and then
you<00:05:11.290> see<00:05:11.500> cows<00:05:11.710> skilled<00:05:12.400> trees<00:05:12.670> off<00:05:12.880> so<00:05:13.120> my

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
you see cows skilled trees off so my

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.520 
you see cows skilled trees off so my
guess<00:05:13.510> is<00:05:13.540> you've<00:05:13.840> got<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.140> get<00:05:14.230> them<00:05:14.380> in<00:05:14.470> a

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
guess is you've got to get them in a

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.100 
guess is you've got to get them in a
certain<00:05:14.800> pattern<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:16.060> really<00:05:16.090> be<00:05:16.870> able<00:05:16.960> to

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
certain pattern to really be able to

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.840 
certain pattern to really be able to
unlock<00:05:17.530> them<00:05:17.800> all<00:05:17.980> in<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.520> know<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:18.700> have

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
unlock them all in it you know you have

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.360 
unlock them all in it you know you have
to<00:05:19.000> unlock<00:05:19.240> they're<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:20.110> more<00:05:20.680> basic<00:05:21.160> ones

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
to unlock they're the more basic ones

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.130 
to unlock they're the more basic ones
before<00:05:21.550> you<00:05:21.760> get<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.090> really<00:05:22.330> high-end<00:05:22.720> ones

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
before you get the really high-end ones

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.720 
before you get the really high-end ones
will<00:05:23.380> kind<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.800> improve<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.280> game<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.430> lot<00:05:24.700> more

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
will kind of improve the game a lot more

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.150 
will kind of improve the game a lot more
so<00:05:25.210> I'm<00:05:25.510> guessing<00:05:26.200> they're<00:05:26.350> rather<00:05:26.650> than<00:05:26.890> be

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
so I'm guessing they're rather than be

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.100 
so I'm guessing they're rather than be
things<00:05:27.700> that<00:05:27.850> improve<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.360> handling<00:05:28.570> or

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
things that improve the handling or

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.270 
things that improve the handling or
speed<00:05:29.530> or<00:05:29.650> anything<00:05:29.830> in<00:05:29.980> the<00:05:30.040> car<00:05:30.190> because

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
speed or anything in the car because

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.090 
speed or anything in the car because
falso<00:05:30.670> isn't<00:05:30.940> really<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.150> game<00:05:31.390> like<00:05:31.600> that<00:05:32.100> what

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
falso isn't really a game like that what

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.520 
falso isn't really a game like that what
it'll<00:05:33.250> basically<00:05:33.400> do<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.180> give<00:05:34.540> you<00:05:34.720> money<00:05:35.020> you

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
it'll basically do is give you money you

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.440 
it'll basically do is give you money you
know<00:05:35.590> more<00:05:35.830> money<00:05:36.040> multipliers<00:05:36.700> for<00:05:36.820> events

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
know more money multipliers for events

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.050 
know more money multipliers for events
and<00:05:37.600> that<00:05:37.690> sort<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.990> thing<00:05:38.140> nothing<00:05:38.620> major<00:05:39.340> but

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
and that sort of thing nothing major but

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.180 
and that sort of thing nothing major but
some<00:05:40.300> things<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.630> kind<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.900> keep<00:05:41.130> kind<00:05:42.130> of

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
some things to kind of keep kind of

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.580 
some things to kind of keep kind of
players<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.580> would<00:05:43.480> like<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.870> explore<00:05:44.290> more

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
players that would like to explore more

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.670 
players that would like to explore more
and<00:05:44.910> unlock<00:05:45.910> more<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.540> keep<00:05:46.750> them<00:05:46.960> going<00:05:46.990> for

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
and unlock more and keep them going for

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.860 
and unlock more and keep them going for
a<00:05:47.860> bit<00:05:48.040> longer<00:05:48.310> so<00:05:48.610> what<00:05:49.390> we<00:05:49.480> see<00:05:49.660> here

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
a bit longer so what we see here

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.420 
a bit longer so what we see here
actually<00:05:50.020> is<00:05:50.470> something<00:05:50.950> I<00:05:51.130> wanted<00:05:51.310> to

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
actually is something I wanted to

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.040 
actually is something I wanted to
mention<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:52.000> word<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.390> came<00:05:52.510> on<00:05:52.720> around<00:05:52.930> the

mention the word that came on around the

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.990 
mention the word that came on around the
same<00:05:53.260> point<00:05:53.560> we've<00:05:53.680> seen<00:05:53.890> on<00:05:54.070> that<00:05:54.100> trailer<00:05:54.760> on

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
same point we've seen on that trailer on

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.390 
same point we've seen on that trailer on
that<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:56.050> know<00:05:56.110> footage<00:05:56.800> that<00:05:57.010> we've<00:05:57.100> seen<00:05:57.370> a

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.280 
that you know footage that we've seen a
good<00:05:57.640> Lamborghini<00:05:58.180> Huracan<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.960> Aston

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290

road that race over and over again

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.410 
road that race over and over again
because<00:06:03.280> they<00:06:03.400> showed<00:06:03.550> about<00:06:03.730> 90<00:06:04.180> billion

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
because they showed about 90 billion

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.410 
because they showed about 90 billion
times<00:06:04.810> but<00:06:05.590> on<00:06:05.860> that<00:06:06.100> is<00:06:06.240> specific<00:06:07.240> racer

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
times but on that is specific racer

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.790 
times but on that is specific racer
actually<00:06:07.690> see<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:07.930> weather<00:06:08.080> turn<00:06:08.380> on<00:06:08.560> at<00:06:08.680> that

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
actually see the weather turn on at that

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.310 
actually see the weather turn on at that
exact<00:06:09.130> same<00:06:09.340> point<00:06:09.700> every<00:06:09.820> single<00:06:10.150> time<00:06:10.720> now

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
exact same point every single time now

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320 
exact same point every single time now
my<00:06:11.470> guess<00:06:11.650> is<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:11.920> is<00:06:12.040> scripted<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:12.910> my<00:06:13.120> guess

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
my guess is it is scripted so my guess

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.090 
my guess is it is scripted so my guess
is<00:06:13.360> then<00:06:13.720> but<00:06:14.230> there's<00:06:14.350> gonna<00:06:14.440> be<00:06:14.530> some<00:06:14.770> events

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
is then but there's gonna be some events

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.340 
is then but there's gonna be some events
with<00:06:15.130> scripted<00:06:15.760> weather<00:06:16.000> script<00:06:16.540> scripted<00:06:17.200> at

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
with scripted weather script scripted at

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.410 
with scripted weather script scripted at
time<00:06:17.620> of<00:06:17.860> day<00:06:18.070> that<00:06:18.310> sort<00:06:18.880> of<00:06:18.970> stuff<00:06:19.210> and

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
time of day that sort of stuff and

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.810 
time of day that sort of stuff and
hopefully<00:06:20.200> that's<00:06:20.710> not<00:06:20.950> the<00:06:21.070> case<00:06:21.220> for<00:06:21.280> every

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
hopefully that's not the case for every

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.970 
hopefully that's not the case for every
single<00:06:22.060> event<00:06:22.270> because<00:06:22.840> unlike<00:06:23.440> some<00:06:23.650> events

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
single event because unlike some events

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.680 
single event because unlike some events
where<00:06:24.100> it's<00:06:24.220> randomized<00:06:24.760> I'm<00:06:25.060> guessing<00:06:25.420> more

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
where it's randomized I'm guessing more

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.270 
where it's randomized I'm guessing more
of<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.900> multiplayer<00:06:26.440> events<00:06:26.830> will<00:06:27.100> be

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
of the multiplayer events will be

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.070 
of the multiplayer events will be
randomized<00:06:27.790> so<00:06:28.000> you<00:06:28.330> start<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:28.840> it<00:06:28.930> might

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
randomized so you start and it might

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.720 
randomized so you start and it might
rain<00:06:29.350> or<00:06:29.530> sudden<00:06:29.950> or<00:06:30.070> you<00:06:30.250> start<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:30.640> it's

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
rain or sudden or you start and it's

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.790 
rain or sudden or you start and it's
nighttime<00:06:31.210> and<00:06:31.690> ends<00:06:31.960> up<00:06:32.140> day<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:32.680> it's

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
nighttime and ends up day and it's

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.340 
nighttime and ends up day and it's
raining<00:06:33.030> because<00:06:34.030> all<00:06:34.600> those<00:06:34.840> scripted

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
raining because all those scripted

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.110 
raining because all those scripted
events<00:06:35.620> can<00:06:35.770> be<00:06:35.920> good<00:06:36.130> I<00:06:36.340> don't<00:06:36.640> think<00:06:36.880> having

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
events can be good I don't think having

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.930 
events can be good I don't think having
too<00:06:37.450> many<00:06:37.690> of<00:06:37.870> them<00:06:38.080> will<00:06:38.740> really<00:06:39.280> benefit<00:06:39.790> I

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
too many of them will really benefit I

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.839 
too many of them will really benefit I
mean<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.120> can<00:06:40.300> understand

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
mean I can understand

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.299 
mean I can understand
introduction<00:06:41.509> and<00:06:41.719> I<00:06:42.050> could<00:06:42.229> understand<00:06:42.740> for

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:43.309 
introduction and I could understand for

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.129 
introduction and I could understand for
you<00:06:43.550> know<00:06:43.639> somewhat<00:06:43.879> HP<00:06:44.240> the<00:06:44.389> particular<00:06:44.809> red

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
you know somewhat HP the particular red

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.629 
you know somewhat HP the particular red
states<00:06:45.379> racing<00:06:45.889> against<00:06:46.129> a<00:06:46.249> train<00:06:46.459> or

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
states racing against a train or

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.649 
states racing against a train or
something<00:06:46.939> you<00:06:47.059> don't<00:06:47.209> really<00:06:47.300> want<00:06:47.539> to<00:06:47.569> do

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
something you don't really want to do

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.629 
something you don't really want to do
that<00:06:47.749> at<00:06:47.899> night<00:06:47.929> but<00:06:48.559> though<00:06:48.649> you<00:06:48.709> might<00:06:49.009> do

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
that at night but though you might do

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.339 
that at night but though you might do
with<00:06:49.819> some<00:06:50.179> of<00:06:50.209> the<00:06:50.330> events<00:06:50.719> you<00:06:50.869> don't<00:06:51.199> know

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
with some of the events you don't know

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.350 
with some of the events you don't know
how<00:06:51.439> many<00:06:51.619> of<00:06:51.709> races<00:06:52.129> of<00:06:52.279> those<00:06:52.729> there<00:06:52.999> are<00:06:53.029> yet

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
how many of races of those there are yet

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.659 
how many of races of those there are yet
so<00:06:53.389> I'll<00:06:53.959> have<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.229> wait<00:06:54.349> and<00:06:54.409> see<00:06:54.740> but<00:06:54.949> I<00:06:55.339> think

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
so I'll have to wait and see but I think

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:57.070 
so I'll have to wait and see but I think
it's<00:06:55.789> cool<00:06:56.029> that<00:06:56.059> they're<00:06:56.839> kind<00:06:57.050> of

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
it's cool that they're kind of

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.329 
it's cool that they're kind of
introducing<00:06:57.499> the<00:06:57.589> weather<00:06:57.740> at<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:57.979> intro

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
introducing the weather at the intro

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:59.829 
introducing the weather at the intro
hopefully<00:06:58.819> as<00:06:58.939> I<00:06:59.029> said<00:06:59.179> though<00:06:59.300> it<00:06:59.479> is<00:06:59.599> not

00:06:59.829 --> 00:06:59.839 
hopefully as I said though it is not

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.899 
hopefully as I said though it is not
literally<00:07:00.349> something<00:07:00.559> they<00:07:00.770> do<00:07:00.909> constantly

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909 
literally something they do constantly

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:03.489 
literally something they do constantly
throughout<00:07:02.179> the<00:07:02.300> game<00:07:02.479> and<00:07:02.929> hopefully<00:07:03.080> it<00:07:03.349> is

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:03.499 
throughout the game and hopefully it is

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:05.859 
throughout the game and hopefully it is
randomized<00:07:04.159> and<00:07:04.520> hopefully<00:07:05.059> in<00:07:05.149> free<00:07:05.569> roam<00:07:05.749> as

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:05.869 
randomized and hopefully in free roam as

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:07.570 
randomized and hopefully in free roam as
well<00:07:06.080> it<00:07:06.259> is<00:07:06.409> randomized<00:07:06.860> rather<00:07:07.129> than<00:07:07.339> just

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
well it is randomized rather than just

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.429 
well it is randomized rather than just
on<00:07:07.789> some<00:07:07.999> kind<00:07:08.209> of<00:07:08.240> cycle<00:07:08.749> and<00:07:08.899> being<00:07:09.229> in<00:07:09.379> a

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:09.439 
on some kind of cycle and being in a

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.350 
on some kind of cycle and being in a
specific<00:07:09.649> area<00:07:09.949> it's<00:07:10.429> raining<00:07:10.849> here<00:07:11.059> it's<00:07:11.300> not

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
specific area it's raining here it's not

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.239 
specific area it's raining here it's not
right<00:07:11.539> there<00:07:11.749> that's<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.139> thing<00:07:12.289> but<00:07:12.979> anyway

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:13.249 
right there that's all thing but anyway

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:14.919 
right there that's all thing but anyway
that<00:07:13.699> is<00:07:13.729> pretty<00:07:14.149> much<00:07:14.330> all<00:07:14.509> I<00:07:14.539> wanted<00:07:14.629> to

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:14.929 
that is pretty much all I wanted to

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:17.230 
that is pretty much all I wanted to
discuss<00:07:15.229> on<00:07:15.379> this<00:07:15.469> video<00:07:15.800> and<00:07:16.099> kind<00:07:17.059> of<00:07:17.119> a

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
discuss on this video and kind of a

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.820 
discuss on this video and kind of a
breakdown<00:07:17.539> I'm<00:07:17.899> kind<00:07:18.110> of<00:07:18.139> giving<00:07:18.259> my<00:07:18.499> thoughts
