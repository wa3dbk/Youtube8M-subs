00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:15.930
 when youtube in this video I will do the 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.930
 review a tweet called visser 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.760
 my being 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.170
 it's something is a tweet similar to the one we urge 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.850
 just that it's much better than states in 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.719
 some things 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.019
 but in most things, this is 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.019
 this 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.110
 and well when we enter, they are here 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.280
 the applications and games more than 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.280
 these highlights 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.540
 here in collections are some 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.320
 collections of games for example from here 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320
 from gameloft 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.430
 to this one 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.430
 and is all all gameloft games 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.420
 like some letters are like in Chinese 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 in Japanese 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 I do not know but for example if you are going to look 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.040
 an application you can search for it by its 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 name and you appear 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 well here we can shake the device 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.610
 and we recommend an application 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.670
 as you can see here in scan we can 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.670
 scan a code from an app 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.190
 and to download it here in this magnifying glass is 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 to search 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.360
 we can search 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.789
 as you can see and here it appears although 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.520
 letters appear as I say Chinese or 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.300
 Japanese I do not know what it is but the case is 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.790
 that when you download it they are there if there 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.319
 Spanish language is in Spanish language if 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.349
 does not have a Spanish language, because English 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.379
 and well we left who we're going 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.409
 here below to categories list all the 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.050
 categories for example games and you get 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.370
 all game categories 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.670
 napster in all categories of the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.670
 apps 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.520
 here in downloads here are those that 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.130
 they are downloading and here they have 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.690
 downloaded what those that were downloaded 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.440
 here in driving 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.850
 the applications that edit them appear 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.230
 to be updated 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.110
 and who else it is the feedback to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.660
 recommend this tweet the settings 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.840
 device information among others 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.310
 things 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.310
 well let's download an application 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.790
 let's see how they are best downloaded 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.790
 saying 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.020
 for example 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.600
 one was doing at random let's grab this 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.970
 the stretch and gives us all the information of 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.880
 the application here says version 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.280
 category 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.700
 the score you can rate it 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.210
 also and here until the description and here 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.210
 there are the images 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.170
 this 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.180
 to download it, you only give it here in 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.180
 to download 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.860
 and automatically it is already downloading 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.510
 that is, you do not occupy 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.610
 captchas as the insta bus that was something 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.530
 that I liked here in versions you can 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.370
 see them the other the other versions 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.370
 of this application 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.340
 and good here as I am downloading 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.950
 something that I also liked is that it tells you 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:27.260
 how much does it take for example that says that 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:27.260
 It's 53 % 57, and here it says the size 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.440
 the time that remains 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.410
 same 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.870
 it is installed alone since it is also the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.040
 discharge 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.040
 it is installed alone 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.690
 and if we want to pause and then that 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.920
 It would be everything I hope you download it 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.910
 call vision and now we are going to teach them 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.910
 how to download it 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.830
 to download it is very simple we are going to 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.770
 our browser in this case is the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.889
 chrome 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:14.680
 and well we are going here to this address that 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:18.400
 it's dot app baby dotcom 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.030
 and good since we entered here 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.320
 if we are in home 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.430
 we give it here the bevel and it brings us to this 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.420
 page and we're just doing it 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.420
 download install 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.430
 and we wait for you to greet us 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.430
 this and we give you to install 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.510
 and it's like you download an application 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.050
 as you can see here is being downloaded 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:55.120
 but I already had it and the other option is if 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.120
 it does not work for them that is to enter 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:02.529
 silvia install larry be able to put you 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.499
 I leave it in the description 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:08.259
 and then there they look for him as a visser and what 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:10.989
 install our same would be all but 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.710
 you liked it if you liked to give me 

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:15.980
 a like 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.840
 if they are not subscribed subscribe and good 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.840
 see you until next time
