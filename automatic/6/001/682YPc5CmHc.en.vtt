00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello people the last time I have you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.760
 already explained how to stream with lava 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.260
 produces the plant is cloudy 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 Well, today I show you how the am 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.009
 best with oil does not prove 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.300
 really best but okay it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.039
 works so eat first you need 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.189
 an oil source 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 This is supposed to be wrong with this oil 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 generators paprika gates 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.040
 the oil well see a moment in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.030
 principle like big bubbling columns 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:47.700
 Show you that just when I'm here 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:54.199
 bucket bucket there blaimer then so 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:00.570
 a fair and then out to the top 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.890
 about the way they look okay packing there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.860
 you then here as in the water and at 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.869
 the lava pump on top so that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.729
 just everything is pumped down 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.040
 under it is to make it more deeply in the ground 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.200
 even a larger oil chamber alternatively 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 There are also oil lables that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.509
 open such a small so please stop 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.470
 such a pond is full of that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:34.860
 but not so much with lava boel 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.750
 filled so the first method to yes 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 So the method to stream with it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.329
 generate is to first as follows 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.159
 you need lover or oil around the angels 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.810
 The compact ones were then made available 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.049
 Similar to the compact angeles have 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.329
 the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.299
 the advantage you always need 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.250
 lover or oil and cooling water around 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 but always run when they are 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.310
 they can not have cooling water 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.600
 do not explode and do not overheat 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.219
 from such a relatively good mileage 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.509
 well on the subject actually needs first 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.879
 you hold the oil well 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.800
 then you have to do that depending on if you are 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.830
 that's the way oil works or wants to 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.040
 but around the inner one 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.580
 So to increase the power so ever 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.210
 after this 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.210
 So that gives then how long that 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.470
 as an energy carrier so how often 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.470
 therefore replenishment needs 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.480
 can you do that as an alternative to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.970
 lazy so sprit convert here with 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.490
 so refineries is also this letter 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.160
 a picture product you have to do 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.960
 still about energy ling and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.930
 solar cell or has an alternative 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.690
 power generation that methods run 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 leave it so I 've built it this way now 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.500
 that it's practically about this one 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 switch here is it should 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.640
 I'll demonstrate this to you 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.510
 here it is produced it is produced 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 the same stuff here 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.670
 that's what we're talking about in this angels 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.280
 and you have to go to an engine 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 generator then looks like this on 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.770
 hv is the most effective in turn 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.450
 you have to connect with cables and then 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.090
 to guide to a mfs clock 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.150
 the big disadvantage is it on 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 duration of space consumption very much 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.880
 inefficient and it has ever produced 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.860
 after checkout angel always only street 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.160
 intermittently so whenever this angel 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.450
 Here, electricity moves and saves it here 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.190
 again so where is there now so it 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.950
 does not really produce that much 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.130
 current and only intermittently for it 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.900
 It is a possibility that often in deserts 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.670
 good exploitation of existing oil resources 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.100
 Alternatively , of course , now too 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.320
 as I said so in the previous tutorial 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.100
 also use as emergency power and stop 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.750
 dance well otherwise 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.940
 There is not much to it 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.030
 I hope you guys helped 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:12.850
 or just do not have to go through another 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:15.959
 But look at tutorial well okay good 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.959
 until next time
