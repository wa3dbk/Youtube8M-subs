beef<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> tenderize

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
beef because we are going to tenderize

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.380 
beef because we are going to tenderize
it<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.729> using<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> process<00:01:07.110> known<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.439> Swissy

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
it and using the process known as Swissy

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
it and using the process known as Swissy
the<00:01:09.390> first<00:01:09.600> step<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.170> put<00:01:10.409> our<00:01:10.530> meat<00:01:10.710> in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the first step is we put our meat in

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
the first step is we put our meat in
saran<00:01:11.400> wrap<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> begin<00:01:12.630> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
saran wrap and I'm going to begin just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
saran wrap and I'm going to begin just
pounding<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.890> nicely<00:01:14.250> until<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.119> nice

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
pounding it out nicely until it's nice

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.100 
pounding it out nicely until it's nice
and<00:01:15.900> flat<00:01:16.200> dinner

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
and flat dinner

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.899 
and flat dinner
now<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> pounded<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.070> about<00:01:20.159> 2<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.580> 3

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
now I pounded this for about 2 or 3

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.140 
now I pounded this for about 2 or 3
minutes<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.570> I've<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.020> about

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
minutes and you can see I've just about

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
minutes and you can see I've just about
reduced<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> width<00:01:24.630> by<00:01:24.900> by<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.530> half<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
reduced the width by by about half and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
reduced the width by by about half and
I've<00:01:26.700> doubled<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> surface<00:01:27.720> area<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I've doubled the surface area of the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499 
I've doubled the surface area of the
steak<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.430> should<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.700> nice<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.060> tender

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
steak so this should be nice and tender

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.520 
steak so this should be nice and tender
this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> process<00:01:31.470> known<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.710> swishing

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
this is the process known as swishing

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
this is the process known as swishing
now<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:34.950> meat<00:01:35.250> tenderizer

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
now that we have our meat tenderizer

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.590 
now that we have our meat tenderizer
Swiss<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> slice<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
Swiss and then I'm going to slice it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.149 
Swiss and then I'm going to slice it
into<00:01:39.869> above<00:01:40.350> I'd<00:01:40.740> say<00:01:41.100> 4<00:01:41.490> inch<00:01:41.759> pieces

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
into above I'd say 4 inch pieces

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.740 
into above I'd say 4 inch pieces
something<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> cut

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
something like this and I'm going to cut

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.120 
something like this and I'm going to cut
all<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:45.960> beef<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:48.560> now<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.979> my

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
all my beef that way now that I have my

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.889 
all my beef that way now that I have my
meat<00:01:50.340> cut<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.790> next<00:01:51.030> step<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
meat cut the next step is we're going to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.649 
meat cut the next step is we're going to
drape<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> meat<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> flour<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.479> nicely

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
drape the meat and flour so it's nicely

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.830 
drape the meat and flour so it's nicely
covered<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.290> each<00:01:55.470> side<00:01:56.420> I'm<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
covered on each side I'm just going to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
covered on each side I'm just going to
set<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.020> aside<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.740> repeat<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.189> process<00:01:59.430> for

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
set it aside and repeat this process for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.050 
set it aside and repeat this process for
the<00:01:59.939> rest<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> meat<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:02.219> next<00:02:02.460> step<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the rest of the meat the next step is to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.929 
the rest of the meat the next step is to
add<00:02:03.210> some<00:02:03.240> oil<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> preheated<00:02:04.320> pan<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> then

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
add some oil to a preheated pan and then

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.119 
add some oil to a preheated pan and then
I'm<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.659> add<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.560> beef<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.009> pan

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I'm just going to add my beef to the pan

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.119 
I'm just going to add my beef to the pan
and<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.690> important<00:02:10.050> not<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> overcrowd<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and it's important not to overcrowd the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.820 
and it's important not to overcrowd the
pan

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
pan

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.620 
pan
so<00:02:12.830> they'd<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.040> some<00:02:13.430> nice<00:02:13.610> space<00:02:14.060> between

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
so they'd have some nice space between

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.160 
so they'd have some nice space between
between<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> beat<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:16.569> just<00:02:17.569> cook<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.930> for

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
between the beat I just cook this for

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.290 
between the beat I just cook this for
about<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.470> minute<00:02:18.950> minute<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.850> half<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.270> each

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
about a minute minute and a half on each

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.930 
about a minute minute and a half on each
side<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:21.020> until<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.950> nicely<00:02:22.190> browned<00:02:24.940> now

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
