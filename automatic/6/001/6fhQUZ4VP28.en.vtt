00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
sinking in progress so this may take a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.789 
sinking in progress so this may take a
little<00:03:46.620> bit<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:49.850> but<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.209> basically

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
little bit to do but this is basically

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.220 
little bit to do but this is basically
and<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.880> started<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.269> give<00:03:54.420> me<00:03:54.540> some<00:03:54.750> messages

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
