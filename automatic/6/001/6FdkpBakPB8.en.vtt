00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
cookie stay longer I'm guessing he's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.430 
cookie stay longer I'm guessing he's
gonna<00:02:51.069> add<00:02:51.340> more<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> mean<00:02:53.170> there's<00:02:53.319> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
gonna add more because I mean there's a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.940 
gonna add more because I mean there's a
lot<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.920> space<00:02:54.220> over<00:02:54.489> here<00:02:55.590> anyways<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:56.829> he

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
lot of space over here anyways if he

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.280 
lot of space over here anyways if he
doesn't<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.459> lo<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:58.629> is<00:02:58.689> good<00:02:58.959> enough<00:02:59.230> for

this is these are the big ones right
here<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.220> best<00:03:03.489> stuff<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.389> get<00:03:04.599> even

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
here this is the best stuff to get even

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.330 
here this is the best stuff to get even
though<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.319> gets<00:03:05.409> harder<00:03:05.889> and<00:03:05.950> harder<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.250> get

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
though it gets harder and harder to get

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.000 
though it gets harder and harder to get
there's<00:03:06.670> five<00:03:06.909> of<00:03:06.939> them<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.389> believe<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:08.010> there

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
there's five of them I believe in there

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.280 
there's five of them I believe in there
last<00:03:09.189> ones<00:03:09.489> like<00:03:09.700> ten<00:03:10.299> million<00:03:10.540> or<00:03:10.870> 100

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
last ones like ten million or 100

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.069 
last ones like ten million or 100
million<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.799> can't<00:03:12.310> remember<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.870> we're<00:03:13.989> gonna

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
million I can't remember so we're gonna

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.520 
million I can't remember so we're gonna
permanently<00:03:14.620> upgrade<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.810> get<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.049> permanent

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530

the<00:03:22.750> thing<00:03:22.959> about<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:24.129> think<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.730> when

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
the thing about this is I think it when

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.110 
the thing about this is I think it when
I've<00:03:24.970> tested<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.419> out<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:26.590> say<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.549> were<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.879> get

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
I've tested it out if say I were to get

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.599 
I've tested it out if say I were to get
the<00:03:29.819> last<00:03:30.819> one<00:03:31.389> I<00:03:31.810> think<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.530> rolling<00:03:33.370> pins

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
the last one I think the rolling pins

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.270 
the last one I think the rolling pins
our<00:03:33.790> last<00:03:34.030> one<00:03:35.790> maybe<00:03:37.109> anyways<00:03:38.109> if<00:03:38.319> I<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.799> at

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
our last one maybe anyways if I get at

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.500 
our last one maybe anyways if I get at
least<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.760> one<00:03:39.940> which<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.299> when<00:03:40.449> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
least this one which is when the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.780 
least this one which is when the
wrinkler<00:03:40.810> start<00:03:41.049> coming<00:03:41.290> out<00:03:41.379> I<00:03:41.579> will<00:03:42.579> start

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
wrinkler start coming out I will start

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
wrinkler start coming out I will start
out<00:03:42.909> with<00:03:43.000> rink<00:03:43.239> lers<00:03:43.419> and<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:44.199> will<00:03:44.349> have<00:03:44.500> to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
out with rink lers and I will have to

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.399 
out with rink lers and I will have to
get<00:03:44.799> these<00:03:45.449> but<00:03:46.449> I<00:03:46.659> think<00:03:46.840> I'm<00:03:46.900> gonna<00:03:46.989> start

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
get these but I think I'm gonna start

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.599 
get these but I think I'm gonna start
out<00:03:48.989> with<00:03:49.989> this<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.799> make<00:03:50.919> sure<00:03:50.979> I<00:03:51.220> can't

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
out with this just to make sure I can't

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.369 
out with this just to make sure I can't
remember<00:03:51.729> that's<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.090> last<00:03:52.269> one<00:03:52.620> um<00:03:53.790> also<00:03:54.790> I

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
remember that's the last one um also I

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.520 
remember that's the last one um also I
believe<00:03:56.379> if<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.889> start<00:03:57.190> out<00:03:57.310> with<00:03:57.430> a

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
believe if you start out with a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.099 
believe if you start out with a
something<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.919> like<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.669> is<00:04:00.790> expensive<00:04:01.209> or

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
something like like this is expensive or

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.629 
something like like this is expensive or
actually<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.799> cookies<00:04:03.159> might<00:04:03.459> be<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:05.139> better

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
actually the cookies might be the better

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:15.529 
actually the cookies might be the better
twice<00:04:06.639> as<00:04:06.819> often<00:04:13.590> let's<00:04:14.590> go<00:04:14.739> with<00:04:14.919> this<00:04:15.040> one

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:15.539 
twice as often let's go with this one

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.029 
twice as often let's go with this one
alright<00:04:16.539> see<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.840> was<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.019> thousand<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:17.979> is

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
alright see that was a thousand this is

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.459 
alright see that was a thousand this is
a<00:04:18.159> hundred<00:04:18.789> thousand<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.780> next<00:04:20.079> one<00:04:20.260> is<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:20.469 
a hundred thousand and the next one is a

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.040 
a hundred thousand and the next one is a
million<00:04:21.099> on<00:04:21.219> the<00:04:21.340> leaf<00:04:21.719> alright<00:04:22.719> so<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.020> other

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
million on the leaf alright so the other

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.680 
million on the leaf alright so the other
thing<00:04:23.440> we're<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.650> start<00:04:23.860> out<00:04:23.979> with<00:04:24.159> is<00:04:24.849> going

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
thing we're to start out with is going

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.290 
thing we're to start out with is going
to<00:04:25.779> be

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
to be

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.960 
to be
something<00:04:27.289> expensive<00:04:31.389> mmm<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:33.190> guess<00:04:34.190> all

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
something expensive mmm I guess all

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.850 
something expensive mmm I guess all
right<00:04:35.120> I'll<00:04:35.240> start<00:04:35.419> out<00:04:35.539> with<00:04:35.599> the<00:04:35.870> 100

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
right I'll start out with the 100

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.100 
right I'll start out with the 100
million<00:04:37.099> right<00:04:37.370> here<00:04:37.750> all<00:04:38.750> right<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:38.900> that's

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
million right here all right so that's

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.529 
million right here all right so that's
all<00:04:39.259> I<00:04:39.319> can<00:04:39.440> start<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:39.770> with<00:04:39.919> now<00:04:40.550> you're

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
all I can start out with now you're

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.499 
all I can start out with now you're
probably<00:04:41.690> thinking<00:04:42.669> well<00:04:43.669> probably<00:04:44.270> thinking

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
probably thinking well probably thinking
