I was opening up an mg g epic pack but
my<00:00:06.270> camera<00:00:06.509> has<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> special<00:00:07.200> feature<00:00:07.379> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
my camera has a special feature of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.959 
my camera has a special feature of
shutting<00:00:08.280> off<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:09.059> 10<00:00:09.389> minutes<00:00:10.309> so<00:00:11.309> since<00:00:11.910> that

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
shutting off at 10 minutes so since that

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.520 
shutting off at 10 minutes so since that
was<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.240> longest<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:12.990> I've<00:00:13.139> made<00:00:13.380> with

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
was the longest video I've made with

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.070 
was the longest video I've made with
this<00:00:13.620> camera<00:00:14.059> if<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.240> shut<00:00:15.450> off<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.870> was

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
this camera if it's shut off and I was

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.130 
this camera if it's shut off and I was
not<00:00:16.379> anticipating<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.480> sort<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> flashing

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
not anticipating that sort of flashing

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.779 
not anticipating that sort of flashing
so<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:19.949> confused<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> end

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
so I got a little confused at the end

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.170 
so I got a little confused at the end
and<00:00:21.260> then<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.410> turned<00:00:22.890> off<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.910> I'm

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and then it just turned off so as I'm

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.480 
and then it just turned off so as I'm
saying<00:00:24.510> before<00:00:24.830> i'm<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> give<00:00:26.220> these
