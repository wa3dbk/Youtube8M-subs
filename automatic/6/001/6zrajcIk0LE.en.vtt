00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
this way but i just found it pretty cool

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.529 
this way but i just found it pretty cool
that<00:00:28.560> i<00:00:28.619> could<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.920> skip<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.460> whole<00:00:29.539> you

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that i could just skip that whole you

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860 
that i could just skip that whole you
know<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.869> zip<00:00:31.769> line<00:00:31.949> thing<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:33.180> anyway<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.690> can

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
know a zip line thing but anyway you can

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.060 
know a zip line thing but anyway you can
just<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> zipline<00:00:34.620> across<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
just take the zipline across and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
just take the zipline across and
basically<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> same<00:00:35.640> thing<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.079> skip

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
