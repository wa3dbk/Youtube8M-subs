how to get the instrument panel apart
the<00:00:28.949> dashboard<00:00:29.429> apart<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:30.000> sick<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> side

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the dashboard apart we're sick as a side

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.650 
the dashboard apart we're sick as a side
panel<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.520> popped<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.090> got<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.420> careful

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
panel I popped out you got to be careful

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
panel I popped out you got to be careful
it's<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.829> pretty<00:00:35.070> tight<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> kind

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it's in pretty tight and you got to kind

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.860 
it's in pretty tight and you got to kind
of<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.430> pry<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.670> back<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.329> bit<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> see

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
of just pry it back a little bit you see

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
of just pry it back a little bit you see
here<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.410> pop<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.190> pressure<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
here it just pop out with pressure the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
here it just pop out with pressure the
thing<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.170> them<00:00:46.289> too

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
thing is you don't want to get them too

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
thing is you don't want to get them too
far<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> middle<00:00:47.640> between<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.149> connectors

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
far in the middle between the connectors

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
far in the middle between the connectors
and<00:00:48.840> start<00:00:49.140> prying<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.129> you'll

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and start prying on there because you'll

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.450 
and start prying on there because you'll
crack<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.420> probably<00:00:51.750> crack<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> panel<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.340> if

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
crack you probably crack the panel so if

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.729 
crack you probably crack the panel so if
you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.910> where<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you can see where they are here this is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.660 
you can see where they are here this is
a<00:00:55.789> Hummer<00:00:56.789> h2<00:00:57.260> 2004<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.640> each

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
a Hummer h2 2004 you can see where each

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
a Hummer h2 2004 you can see where each
of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> connectors<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> did<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of the connectors are so what I did is I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.609 
of the connectors are so what I did is I
pried<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.340> apart<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.690> cycle<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pried it apart I just do cycle use a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.020 
pried it apart I just do cycle use a
little<00:01:04.860> screwdriver<00:01:05.220> whatever<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.939> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
little screwdriver whatever I see you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
little screwdriver whatever I see you
just<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.689> there<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> worked<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:07.979> far

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
just got it in there and worked out far

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.969 
just got it in there and worked out far
enough<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> could<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.540> tabs

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
enough so I could see the little tabs

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
enough so I could see the little tabs
and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.110> little

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and then you know put on these little

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.920 
and then you know put on these little
tools<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> read<00:01:15.330> near<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> tab

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
tools in and got to read near the tab

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
tools in and got to read near the tab
and<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> pressure<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.070> near<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> tab

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and put the pressure there near the tab

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.630 
and put the pressure there near the tab
so<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> pop<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> said<00:01:20.520> if

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so you can pop them out like I said if

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.950 
so you can pop them out like I said if
you<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> pressure<00:01:21.210> too<00:01:21.479> far<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.840> between

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you get the pressure too far in between

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
you get the pressure too far in between
you<00:01:22.439> put<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> lot<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> stress<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> panel

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you put a lot of stress on the panel

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
you put a lot of stress on the panel
here<00:01:24.210> away<00:01:24.509> from<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.810> tabs<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
here away from the tabs and you want the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.330 
here away from the tabs and you want the
pressure<00:01:26.369> near<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> tabs<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.600> pop<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.340> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
pressure near the tabs to pop it out so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.749 
pressure near the tabs to pop it out so
that<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> first<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.210> came<00:01:30.509> out

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
that was the first thing that came out

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.870 
that was the first thing that came out
all<00:01:32.759> right<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:34.009> then<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:36.900> had<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
all right and then I had to take all the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
all right and then I had to take all the
little<00:01:39.060> hex<00:01:39.390> screws<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> dashboard

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
little hex screws here in the dashboard

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.990 
little hex screws here in the dashboard
I<00:01:41.729> put<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.119> took<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> lipstick<00:01:43.590> hair<00:01:44.000> come

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I put up took all the lipstick hair come

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.719 
I put up took all the lipstick hair come
over<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.740> piece<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.040> comes<00:01:47.490> out

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
over here for this piece that comes out

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.940 
over here for this piece that comes out
and<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.689> were<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.619> tough

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and these were in like a really tough

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.120 
and these were in like a really tough
that<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.520> tough<00:01:50.759> unscrewing<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.979> but<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that was tough unscrewing them but you
