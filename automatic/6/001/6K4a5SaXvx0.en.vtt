you

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.030 

I<00:00:05.180> certainly<00:00:05.900> first<00:00:06.440> have<00:00:06.590> to<00:00:06.710> say<00:00:06.830> that<00:00:07.009> I

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
I certainly first have to say that I

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.110 
I certainly first have to say that I
consider<00:00:07.279> myself<00:00:07.609> to<00:00:07.819> be<00:00:07.910> secular<00:00:08.620> I

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
consider myself to be secular I

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.820 
consider myself to be secular I
certainly<00:00:11.120> don't<00:00:11.389> think<00:00:11.559> burkas<00:00:12.559> are

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
certainly don't think burkas are

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.330 
certainly don't think burkas are
something<00:00:13.309> that<00:00:13.490> I'm<00:00:13.730> comfortable<00:00:14.420> with<00:00:15.340> when

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
something that I'm comfortable with when

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.769 
something that I'm comfortable with when
I<00:00:16.369> see<00:00:16.730> women<00:00:17.000> in<00:00:17.090> them<00:00:17.240> with<00:00:17.360> their<00:00:17.539> faces

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
I see women in them with their faces

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.870 
I see women in them with their faces
almost<00:00:18.140> entirely<00:00:18.560> covered<00:00:18.980> it's<00:00:19.220> it's<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.699> sort

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
almost entirely covered it's it's a sort

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.029 
almost entirely covered it's it's a sort
of<00:00:19.940> hard<00:00:20.210> in<00:00:20.449> a<00:00:20.539> culture<00:00:20.869> which<00:00:21.020> is<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.199> open

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
of hard in a culture which is a open

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.529 
of hard in a culture which is a open

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
culture in which faces are uncovered

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.509 
culture in which faces are uncovered
it's<00:00:23.660> very<00:00:23.839> hard<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.169> to<00:00:24.919> deal<00:00:25.070> with<00:00:25.220> on<00:00:25.400> the

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
it's very hard to to deal with on the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.329 
it's very hard to to deal with on the
other<00:00:25.640> hand<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.089> seems<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.449> me<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:27.980> can't

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
other hand it seems to me that you can't

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.019 
other hand it seems to me that you can't
separate<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:29.480> French<00:00:30.130> desire<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.400> ban<00:00:31.699> this

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
separate the French desire to ban this

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.360 
separate the French desire to ban this
from<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:33.140> kind<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.620> underlying<00:00:33.980> racism<00:00:34.400> about

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
from a kind of underlying racism about

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.910 
from a kind of underlying racism about
Arabs<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.580> Muslims<00:00:38.140> former<00:00:39.140> Colonials<00:00:39.680> from

North Africa and West Africa and you

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.050 
North Africa and West Africa and you
there's<00:00:42.680> just<00:00:42.860> no<00:00:43.040> way<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.310> separate<00:00:43.760> them<00:00:43.940> and

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
there's just no way to separate them and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.660 
there's just no way to separate them and
so<00:00:44.180> on<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.480> grounds<00:00:44.990> of<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.100> fact<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.490> this

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
so on the grounds of the fact that this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.410 
so on the grounds of the fact that this
constitutes<00:00:47.450> a<00:00:47.570> form<00:00:47.810> of<00:00:47.930> discrimination<00:00:48.110> and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
constitutes a form of discrimination and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.800 
constitutes a form of discrimination and
a<00:00:50.420> failure<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.500> actually<00:00:52.130> consult<00:00:52.610> with<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
the people who are wearing them and to

the people who are wearing them and to

will increase the numbers of people who

are wearing these rather than do away

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.859 
are wearing these rather than do away
with<00:01:30.770> them<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.509> as<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.569> policy<00:01:33.229> issue<00:01:33.409> in

with them so as a policy issue in

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.359 
with them so as a policy issue in
countries<00:01:35.869> in<00:01:36.020> which<00:01:36.170> Muslims<00:01:36.499> are<00:01:36.859> a

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
countries in which Muslims are a

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.940 
countries in which Muslims are a
minority<00:01:37.939> population<00:01:38.569> in<00:01:38.619> general<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.829> in

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
minority population in general and in

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.980 
minority population in general and in
France<00:01:40.219> in<00:01:40.490> particular<00:01:40.969> I<00:01:41.149> think<00:01:41.749> it's<00:01:41.869> a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
France in particular I think it's a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.260 
France in particular I think it's a
really<00:01:42.289> bad<00:01:42.499> idea<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:43.130> ban<00:01:43.639> these<00:01:43.850> things<00:01:44.090> I

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
really bad idea to ban these things I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.459 
really bad idea to ban these things I
think<00:01:44.929> that<00:01:45.729> certainly<00:01:46.990> wearing<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.079> headscarf

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
think that certainly wearing a headscarf

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.440 
think that certainly wearing a headscarf
is<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.249> different<00:01:49.729> thing<00:01:49.880> from<00:01:50.060> wearing<00:01:50.299> a

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
is a different thing from wearing a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.609 
is a different thing from wearing a
burka<00:01:50.719> actually<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.759> in<00:01:52.880> either<00:01:53.119> case<00:01:53.619> there

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
burka actually but in either case there

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.029 
burka actually but in either case there
is<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.520> certain<00:01:56.240> there<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.630> at<00:01:57.530> least<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:58.009> part

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
is a certain there is at least in part

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.699 
is a certain there is at least in part
the<00:01:58.459> notion<00:01:58.999> that<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.749> have<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.020> cover<00:02:00.289> women

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
the notion that you have to cover women

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.910 
the notion that you have to cover women
to<00:02:01.179> prevent<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.749> sort<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:03.049> sexual<00:02:03.380> temptation

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
to prevent the sort of sexual temptation

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.580 
to prevent the sort of sexual temptation
of<00:02:04.039> men<00:02:04.249> that<00:02:04.520> they<00:02:04.579> represent<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:05.659> there<00:02:06.469> are

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
of men that they represent but there are

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.529 
of men that they represent but there are
other<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.490> seems<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.850> me<00:02:07.969> Muslims<00:02:08.300> are<00:02:08.420> not
