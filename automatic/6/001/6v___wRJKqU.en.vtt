00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Today I will show you how to make a front 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.759
 flip that is a pretty easy trick this 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.350
 trick is the counterpart of the back flip and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.910
 here as the backflip on the knees 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.290
 searched on the chest for rolling 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
 this time it is the chest and who is looking 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 the knees to roll getting the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 reverse effect is to say a turn is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 forward will help me well in that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.660
 who trains more than a year ago is a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 click is called gymnastics we 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 we will train in pasco and sand not like me 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 I took it out, breaking the curious pact 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.810
 the only requirement for this movement 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.340
 it is the somersault the simple somersault the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.439
 which we should practice a hydra 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 explaining height is to say goal of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 high this can be a tedious process 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 but it is extremely necessary since we 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.390
 will teach how to maintain the room when 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 let's be on our toes because to keep the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.510
 chin stuck to the chest which is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.550
 totally necessary in the mortal 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 go ahead the following as you can see 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 with a somersault but without using 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.149
 hands and passing your back very close to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.039
 this will help to gain confidence and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 keep working the minute concept 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.820
 in the chest we will move to a place hd 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 that can hold on breaking dark 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.810
 returns not so much as it is necessary to fall 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.760
 reclined a couple of times 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.500
 and what we will do now is skip one and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 again trying to make it immortal 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.150
 go ahead like that what we owe 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.040
 try in each jump is that the head 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.200
 Bastien as little as possible as well 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 we will achieve a greater height at the moment 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.070
 to roll and we should never forget the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.510
 concept of the chest vera since 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.160
 this will be a great help at the moment of 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.050
 roll the main mistakes are 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.310
 Our front is mainly 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.650
 shit with fear 2 open before or 3 and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.870
 no less likely to stay tight ha ha 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.860
 ha what good 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.860
 and this we already have 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.370
 enough 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.080
 old quiet but possibly what 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.360
 happen is not going up the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.740
 arms is a very common mistake which 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 will make you go forward and not 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.730
 upwards another error can be the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 raise your knees when doing the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.750
 lethal forward that created a force 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.190
 inverse only the chest is who 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.910
 should look for the knees and not the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.350
 reverse 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.180
 and if what you want is to do this, this 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.190
 you must not only bend the news 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.899
 because you have to look back to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 time to jump because although you do 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.710
 why look you up if your 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.690
 arms go forward you'll say towards 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.920
 forward good on a movement of the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.630
 today I hope you liked it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.910
 today do not shoot variations but it does not matter 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.990
 the next movement will be the day 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.990
 Wednesday see you
