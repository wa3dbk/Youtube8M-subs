00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:52.700 
no we're not gonna do that fast don't
worry

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:02.430 

getting<00:03:53.710> rolled<00:03:53.890> I'm<00:03:54.070> doing<00:03:54.400> this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.320

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
there's so many ways you could do it you

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.870 
there's so many ways you could do it you
miss<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.690> stream<00:04:07.990> go

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
miss the stream go

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.060 
miss the stream go
