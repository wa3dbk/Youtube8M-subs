00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.670
 hello in this video i will tell you 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.789
 about cheating while drilling a well 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.869
 by the drilling companies as well as 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.419
 avoid this deception in your address 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 I'll start with the banal before giving 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.490
 prepay for well drilling on your 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.030
 plot you need to read 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.980
 carefully with the contract and sign it 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.070
 special attention should be paid to the item 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.309
 associated with diluted drilling here 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.399
 there are two kinds of cheating in the first case to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 a brigade comes to you early in the morning 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.469
 drill well until late evening 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 they tell you that they have not found water, although they 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 didn't even try to identify the aquifer 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 horizon 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 take money from you for the development of drilling 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.429
 and leaves for the next client 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.309
 The second kind of deception is due to the fact that 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.920
 if while drilling the drillers stumble on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.990
 a stone instead of being put 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 near and try to go around it 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 or put a special roller 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.190
 chisel over stones they also charge you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.230
 money for development drilling and has the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.580
 svoyasi 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.710
 if it is these kinds of cheating you can 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 insulate just reading carefully 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.660
 contract to get 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 well that will serve you at least 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.070
 more than 5 years 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.140
 you will need to attend 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.100
 object during casing filtering 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 element itself with one column and sprinkling 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.290
 filter element rubble or pg itself 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 Also, special attention should be paid to 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.310
 filter 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.670
 its performance filter is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.720
 the most important component of the well from 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.930
 its quality will depend on how much 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.990
 well will serve you and whether 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.450
 you clean it and how often ideally 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.120
 the filter must be slotted with applied 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.819
 pvd sprayed on it with this 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.190
 filter even fine sand is not 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.549
 will penetrate inside your well 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.069
 and the water will flow just slit 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.750
 filter can also be set but only 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.689
 If I'm an aquifer 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.680
 vas consists of high modulus sand 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.769
 size 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.319
 if the drillers only came to you but 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.890
 an hour so immediately brought your 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.359
 filter not knowing what sand will be 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.790
 consist aquifer 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.010
 it should at least tell you them 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.019
 competence in this case is worth 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.249
 most control what sand 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.920
 will be leached from the aquifer 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:47.040
 the horizon if the sand will be washed out 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.849
 small it is better to buy at your own expense 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.900
 spend 5-6 thousand on the filter 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.359
 quality pvd-coated 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.849
 but you will be sure that in a couple 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.849
 years you have not filled the well with sand 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.859
 and will not lead and so the pump breakdowns 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.980
 well will serve you more than a dozen 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.439
 years ago directly I became 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.799
 bystander cheating from not 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.530
 good faith and drilling company neighbor 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.139
 drilled a well depth of 19 meters 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.819
 further rested stone and instead 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.939
 to pass this stone either 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.700
 rearranged and near the drilling company 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.459
 just lowered the casing filter 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.909
 the column was poured into the clay 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.879
 space to the top with sand and dirt 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:36.120
 water passing through the sand to the bottom 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.579
 wells passed further through the filter and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.029
 gave the impression that the well 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.470
 the drill functions quite normally 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:46.780
 the company took the money left 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.190
 such wells served only six months 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.550
 then 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.880
 the sand turned into loam and filter 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.820
 scored outside with clay, respectively 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.250
 Drilling Company tube did not take into 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.110
 phone and apparently changed and in the end 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.420
 the neighbor was left without a well and without money 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.920
 summing up the following is obtained for 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.260
 order to get quality 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.070
 well that will serve you is not one 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.200
 ten years 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.810
 you will need yourself 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.109
 control the brave company either 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.120
 can ring a few previous ones 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.370
 customers of this company and not those 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.010
 which she drilled well in the past 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.280
 a week about those who have a well 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.370
 It has been operating for more than a year and learn 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.480
 they as well also to mind 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.910
 the saying comes stingy pays twice 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.570
 because saving one or two thousand on 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.350
 the filter 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.610
 you can shorten the term several times 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.610
 your well service
