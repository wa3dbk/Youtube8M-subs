00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.570
 a new online part and you see 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.289
 starts already in the middle of the opposite 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.289
 January 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.260
 Of course not even now 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 I've got a red taken and now 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 Let's see how far I'm coming 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.640
 my view mode here is currently running 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.640
 reasonably okay 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.450
 Santa clara is already used up and 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.450
 recharge are no currently 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.730
 in the internet came with battery god's sake 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.460
 shit did not work out success like you did 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.460
 there is a comic and manga 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.780
 come to this range of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.780
 susan o 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.770

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.950
 Come on, no 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.670
 past 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 not bad it can be the fight 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.530
 must intervene at the moment 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:46.009
 little shit again come on 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.990
 we finish that must work 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.659
 we are reasonably equal opponents 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.619
 like we do not look like this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:01.100
 Let's go now, well and now 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.100
 how you then 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.069
 that should kill itself now but 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.440
 after all, weaken 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.700
 so it is good 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.220
 I have a light weight now 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.430
 play with the power of his king com 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.510
 yahoo 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.510
 we'll make room for you in video mode 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.510

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.870
 OK then 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 a head to head race now 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.080
 but if there is little character 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.690

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:59.680

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:05.480
