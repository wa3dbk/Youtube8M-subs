because from the pictures that I saw her
brow<00:02:10.159> bone<00:02:10.429> area<00:02:10.640> was<00:02:11.140> extremely<00:02:12.140> highlighted

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
brow bone area was extremely highlighted

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.300 
brow bone area was extremely highlighted
but<00:02:13.010> really<00:02:13.459> over<00:02:13.819> again

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
but really over again

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.670 
but really over again
so<00:02:15.030> make<00:02:15.300> sure<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.600> pack<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.440> white

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so make sure you pack on that white

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.920 
so make sure you pack on that white
shimmering<00:02:17.220> eyeshadow<00:02:17.459> under<00:02:18.270> there<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.720> can

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
shimmering eyeshadow under there you can

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.860 
shimmering eyeshadow under there you can
even<00:02:19.050> use<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> pink<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.520> champagne<00:02:21.270> color<00:02:21.569> or

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
even use a pink or a champagne color or

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.470 
even use a pink or a champagne color or
maybe<00:02:22.530> not<00:02:22.830> nothing<00:02:23.310> gold<00:02:23.640> base<00:02:23.940> make<00:02:24.300> sure

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
maybe not nothing gold base make sure

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.199 
maybe not nothing gold base make sure
it's<00:02:24.660> more<00:02:24.840> white<00:02:25.170> base<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.740> silver<00:02:26.160> base<00:02:26.400> so

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
it's more white base to silver base so

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059 
it's more white base to silver base so
you<00:02:27.270> can<00:02:27.510> maybe<00:02:27.690> use<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> light<00:02:28.230> baby<00:02:28.470> pink<00:02:28.650> if

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
you can maybe use a light baby pink if

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.430 
you can maybe use a light baby pink if
you<00:02:29.100> want<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:30.300> work<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.750> well

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
you want because that can work as well

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.380

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
part I didn't speed up or anything

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.640

eyeliner it's really easy to pop some
white<00:03:02.760> eyeshadow<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.540> inner<00:03:03.630> corners<00:03:04.260> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
white eyeshadow in the inner corners and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.960 
white eyeshadow in the inner corners and
underneath<00:03:04.950> your<00:03:05.069> brow<00:03:05.310> bone<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
underneath your brow bone but the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.580 
underneath your brow bone but the
eyeliner<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> tricky<00:03:07.230> part

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
eyeliner is the tricky part

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.490 
eyeliner is the tricky part
so<00:03:08.040> she<00:03:08.130> does<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:08.670> really<00:03:09.209> thick<00:03:09.870> eyeliner

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.120 
and what I also noticed is that she has
a<00:03:49.950> line<00:03:50.400> underneath<00:03:51.120> her<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.230> waterline<00:03:52.890> as

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
a line underneath her like waterline as

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.770 
a line underneath her like waterline as
well<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:53.850> guess<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.239> makes<00:03:54.420> her<00:03:54.570> eyes<00:03:54.720> look

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
well so I guess it makes her eyes look

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.440 
well so I guess it makes her eyes look
tall<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> skipped<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> mascara

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
tall like so I skipped the mascara

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.030 
tall like so I skipped the mascara
pretty<00:03:57.750> quickly<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.440> then<00:03:58.620> I'm<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:58.920> gonna
