the<00:01:01.119> frame<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:04.170> don't<00:01:05.170> think<00:01:05.379> it's<00:01:05.530> been

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
the frame I don't think it's been

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830 
the frame I don't think it's been
repainted<00:01:06.159> but<00:01:06.700> I'm<00:01:06.970> not<00:01:07.180> gonna<00:01:07.390> go<00:01:07.600> with<00:01:07.720> the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
repainted but I'm not gonna go with the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.080 
repainted but I'm not gonna go with the
original<00:01:07.930> color<00:01:08.380> I<00:01:08.500> mean<00:01:08.680> it's<00:01:08.830> just<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.159> just<00:01:09.970> a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
original color I mean it's just a just a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.570 
original color I mean it's just a just a
dull<00:01:10.360> drab<00:01:10.930> kind<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.530> gray<00:01:11.799> so<00:01:11.860> I'm<00:01:12.490> probably

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
dull drab kind of gray so I'm probably

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.850 
dull drab kind of gray so I'm probably
gonna<00:01:12.790> repaint<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.390> maybe<00:01:13.720> green<00:01:14.200> or<00:01:14.500> red<00:01:16.860> it's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
internally geared hub so that won't do

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.490 
internally geared hub so that won't do
much<00:01:25.180> work<00:01:26.130> there's<00:01:27.130> actually<00:01:27.520> some<00:01:28.500> switches

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500

which I think I think there's a bolt in

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.840 
which I think I think there's a bolt in
there<00:01:58.660> I<00:01:58.720> can<00:01:58.930> adjust<00:01:59.400> plus<00:02:00.400> I<00:02:00.490> have<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.640> fix

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
there I can adjust plus I have to fix

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.970 
there I can adjust plus I have to fix
the<00:02:01.000> fender<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.840> clean<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.350> surface<00:02:02.740> rest

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
the fender and clean the surface rest

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.240 
the fender and clean the surface rest
off<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:05.200> wheels<00:02:05.440> they<00:02:05.800> should<00:02:06.010> shine

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
off the of the wheels they should shine

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.830 
off the of the wheels they should shine
like<00:02:06.460> new<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.250> yeah<00:02:09.399> as<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.759> have<00:02:10.000> some<00:02:10.360> time<00:02:10.600> I'm

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
like new so yeah as I have some time I'm

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.940 
like new so yeah as I have some time I'm
gonna<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.310> work<00:02:12.460> on<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.730> here

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
gonna get to work on this here

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.410 
gonna get to work on this here
I<00:02:14.980> guess<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.640> needs<00:02:15.850> pretty<00:02:16.060> much<00:02:16.240> a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
I guess that needs pretty much a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.000 
I guess that needs pretty much a
complete<00:02:16.870> rebuild<00:02:17.350> restoration<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:20.010> it's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
complete rebuild restoration so it's

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.350 
complete rebuild restoration so it's
just<00:02:21.130> something<00:02:21.820> extra<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.600> take<00:02:22.630> up<00:02:22.960> my<00:02:23.110> time
