00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.709
 how about people like we are progress and 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.650
 great perfectly welcome to a 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.059
 gameplay on while playing with him 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.769
 my question is the following because you 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.019
 you put part of the formula now because 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.090
 you put on light weight to be 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.529
 If you 're missing out on a 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.429
 slot put on the vest put manuals of 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.429
 any other 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:35.989
 in this video of something today 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.610
 in 2015 and I keep telling people 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.640
 they keep pushing me do not tell you 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.980
 people not the fact that you pull the cable 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.449
 have thrown the cable because this 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.640
 expression as was given because 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.079
 beginning when youtube and that then 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.030
 the people were pulling the cable that 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.469
 it meant going out to the main menu of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.629
 the console directly to pay the 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.699
 console in case it's a bad game for 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.379
 that I did not tell you for the proportion and 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.010
 stay in your proportion of two and 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.840
 half or two and peak and that was tamal vitro 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610
 pull the cable because if you get a 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.010
 bad game rebooted the console if not 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.200
 I kept 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.970
 what happens what good is that expression is 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.890
 has gone has been changing with the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.420
 course of the year and now the expression 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.340
 of sticking the cable 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.040
 if I say we have a game and you see 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.690
 you are keeping anything if 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.690
 you leave from there to many people 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.360
 says that's peeling the cable is worth 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.970
 when you are a game and you are 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.070
 going wrong and turn off the console so that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.660
 the ratio keeps you well that I 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.760
 it seems unfortunate and I think that day 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.110
 today I could not make a video 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.790
 referring to that because it does not have 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.710
 many more laps but I nevertheless 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.870
 for example if you put a game and I see 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.640
 that in the other team there is someone who 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.710
 love tactical insertion and someone 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.630
 that does not stop throwing I thought someone 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.370
 that me that being that is playing with the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.550
 light machine gun and not stop killing me 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.200
 I do not have to endure more better 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.680
 examples is simply a game that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 they have 50 advantage losses and suddenly 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.320
 you see the enemy on the way 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
 well I will obviously stay in that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.840
 heading to receive the streak that I have 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.520
 thought to say I'm not dead because I 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.170
 have to endure and a streak not and I 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.220
 directly abandoned departure of fact 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.709
 if you see my victory and defeat in black 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.770
 ops 2 for example I have then imagine 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.850
 5000 victories and 15,000 defeats because 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.530
 I sell a game I do not like 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 abandonment of the game did not entrust me 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.090
 abandoning a master's game more 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.220
 abandonment I get in yemen abandonment see me 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.380
 with turbine not all because to count one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.630
 not heading and I think that today 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.080
 since 2015 that people keep saying 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.760
 that of mother as I think she is not 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.739
 justified is to say I do not know why the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.750
 people are still worried so much about 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.030
 that when I do streaming and suddenly 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.890
 start a game and kill me four or 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.900
 five times and changing my decision 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.580
 tactics and such and abandoned departure as well 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.160
 came in starts saying my mother the strip 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.200
 cables I do not know what really proportions me 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.480
 it sounds to me could my production but in the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.370
 bronx in any case duty I do not 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.140
 proportion is always one for 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.150
 down there is my proportion always 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.530
 more receiver in albany surfer in pc 4 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.830
 I have it positive but because the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.070
 matchmaking pc 4 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.170
 wonderful wonderful then well no 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.030
 I know why he keeps pissing off so much 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.760
 you how good that just one 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.830
 departure or if I will find myself in some 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.840
 departure of custom method and abandonment 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.760
 departure by expected search the cable 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.980
 Follow us and follow your change from today 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.710
 continue to worry about what happens in 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.390
 you can discuss politely in 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.700
 the comments you already know that I always 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.890
 I read everything always always read them 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.750
 all the comments if you put 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.440
 chulitos block and tone I do not have I do not have 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.410
 inconvenient problem he hears in 2015 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.470
 is still said saying that about peeling 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.120
 the cable and that is still a little bit 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.459
 frowned upon what if your talent a 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.860
 I was going to imagine of clark 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.390
 me in the other time they go 40 74 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.390
 because I can not leave games
