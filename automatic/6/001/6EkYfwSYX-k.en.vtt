play<00:00:47.460> that's<00:00:47.579> eerily<00:00:48.510> similar<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
play that's eerily similar so go to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.029 
play that's eerily similar so go to
pistol<00:00:49.590> trips<00:00:50.120> flip<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> play<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.600> me

pistol trips flip the play for me

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.939 
pistol trips flip the play for me
counter<00:00:53.660> very<00:00:54.660> similar<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.649> then

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
counter very similar to this and then

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.500 
counter very similar to this and then
just<00:00:56.160> playmaker<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> run<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.270> only<00:00:57.420> thing

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just playmaker the run the only thing

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.689 
just playmaker the run the only thing
that<00:00:57.629> what's<00:00:58.140> different<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:59.309> you'd<00:00:59.670> have

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that what's different here is you'd have

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
that what's different here is you'd have
Wayne<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> far<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:00.750> you'd<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.050> lined<00:01:01.289> up

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
Wayne on the far right you'd be lined up

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
Wayne on the far right you'd be lined up
in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> tightest<00:01:01.890> spot<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.309> yeah

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
in the tightest spot on the right yeah

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
in the tightest spot on the right yeah
and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.090> too<00:01:03.300> far<00:01:03.660> left<00:01:03.870> receivers

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and then you're too far left receivers

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
and then you're too far left receivers
would<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> tight<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> small

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
would be in tight it's a small

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.280 
would be in tight it's a small
difference<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:06.750> make<00:01:06.900> kind<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
difference and it does make kind of a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
difference and it does make kind of a
big<00:01:07.409> difference<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.040> run<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> play<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> I'll

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
big difference but run the play and I'll

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.230 
big difference but run the play and I'll
show<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.140> makes<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.240> devastating

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
show you what makes this so devastating

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
I got to get more inside there in den

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.450 
I got to get more inside there in den
outside<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:15.330> makes<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> so

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
outside all right what makes this so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
outside all right what makes this so
great<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> following<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.600> these

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
great it's the following right these

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.590 
great it's the following right these
counters<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:21.180> good<00:01:21.360> job<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
counters what they do really good job of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.370 
counters what they do really good job of
is<00:01:21.960> they<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.070> good<00:01:23.310> job<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:24.380> creating

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
is they do a really good job of creating

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.630 
is they do a really good job of creating
a<00:01:26.299> positive<00:01:27.299> net<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.409> terms<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> resources<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
a positive net in terms of resources of

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
a positive net in terms of resources of
blockers<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> offense<00:01:31.049> right<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
blockers for the offense right so you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.469 
blockers for the offense right so you
can<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.250> pulling<00:01:32.670> guard<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.270> guard

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
can see the two pulling guard the guard

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.870 
can see the two pulling guard the guard
in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.659> tackle<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.530> kick<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.610> look<00:01:35.790> at

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in the tackle they kick and then look at

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
in the tackle they kick and then look at
you<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> literally<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:37.430> four

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you have you literally have four

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
you have you literally have four
defenders<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.570> aren't<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
defenders that just aren't going to do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.100 
defenders that just aren't going to do
anything<00:01:40.310> against<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.400> run<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.909> have

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
anything against this run so you have

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.359 
anything against this run so you have
99-91<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.439> linebacker<00:01:43.860> behind<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
99-91 the linebacker behind them and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.770 
99-91 the linebacker behind them and
then<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> deep<00:01:44.729> safety<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.450> receiver

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
then the deep safety which that receiver

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
then the deep safety which that receiver
is<00:01:45.930> blocking<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.979> he's<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> part<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
is blocking but he's not a part of the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.490 
is blocking but he's not a part of the
play<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> also<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> deep

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
play and then you also have the deep

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.700 
play and then you also have the deep
safety<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.360> four<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.290> 11

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
safety so you you have four of your 11

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
safety so you you have four of your 11
defenders<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.610> against<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.970> run<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
defenders going up against a run that is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
defenders going up against a run that is
that's<00:01:55.619> they're<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.369> getting<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> gate<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that's they're just getting the gate it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.120 
that's they're just getting the gate it
every<00:01:57.570> time<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.680> we're<00:01:58.860> trying<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
every time so when we're trying to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.649 
every time so when we're trying to
understand<00:01:59.460> why<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.030> counter<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.509> good

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
understand why is the counter so good

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.600 
understand why is the counter so good
because<00:02:00.780> everyone<00:02:01.079> says<00:02:01.110> kids<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
because everyone says kids are the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
because everyone says kids are the
counter<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.899> good

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
counter so good that's kind of so good

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.749 
counter so good that's kind of so good
the<00:02:04.740> first<00:02:04.979> thing<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> look<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the first thing you have to look at is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
the first thing you have to look at is
why<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.540> cuz<00:02:06.899> you're<00:02:06.990> getting

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
why is it good cuz you're getting

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
why is it good cuz you're getting
consistently<00:02:07.799> three<00:02:08.550> four<00:02:08.729> guys<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> can't

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
consistently three four guys that can't

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260 
consistently three four guys that can't
do<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> thing<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:10.229> anything<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.940> can't

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
do

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250 
do
anything<00:02:13.250> on<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:14.480> defense<00:02:14.840> side<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.110> ball

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
anything on the defense side of the ball

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.320 
anything on the defense side of the ball
to<00:02:15.290> really<00:02:15.650> alter<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.190> they<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:16.910> do<00:02:17.180> that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
to really alter that they just do that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.880 
to really alter that they just do that
every<00:02:17.600> time<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.320> can<00:02:18.470> make<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> crazy

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
every time like I can make a crazy

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.130 
every time like I can make a crazy
formation<00:02:19.430> where<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.790> shift<00:02:20.180> guys<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.780> I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
formation where like I shift guys and I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.650 
formation where like I shift guys and I
move<00:02:21.380> guys<00:02:21.530> around<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.210> doulas<00:02:23.210> crazy<00:02:23.450> stuff

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
move guys around and doulas crazy stuff

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.060 
move guys around and doulas crazy stuff
it's<00:02:23.810> not<00:02:23.840> practical<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.530> in-game

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
it's not practical for in-game

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.370 
it's not practical for in-game
experience<00:02:25.280> right<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.480> that's<00:02:26.960> what<00:02:27.200> makes

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
experience right so that's what makes

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.360 
experience right so that's what makes
first<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.770> all<00:02:27.830> that's<00:02:27.950> what<00:02:28.040> makes<00:02:28.250> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
first of all that's what makes the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.700 
first of all that's what makes the
counter<00:02:28.670> great<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.660> on<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.990> second<00:02:30.440> aspect

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
counter great but on the second aspect

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.100 
counter great but on the second aspect
of<00:02:31.220> things<00:02:31.340> okay<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:32.210> had<00:02:32.360> four<00:02:32.660> different<00:02:32.780> on

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
of things okay we had four different on

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.330 
of things okay we had four different on
the<00:02:33.170> right<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.710> can't<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.220> do

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
the right that we can't get to do

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100 
the right that we can't get to do
anything<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.210> left<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.660> get<00:02:35.780> another<00:02:35.990> one

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
anything on the left you get another one

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.590 
anything on the left you get another one
without<00:02:36.290> yeah<00:02:37.070> five<00:02:37.550> defenders<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.390> you

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
without yeah five defenders that you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.110 
without yeah five defenders that you
kind<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.930> lose<00:02:39.080> control<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.790> every<00:02:40.790> time<00:02:40.970> you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
kind of lose control of every time you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.090 
kind of lose control of every time you
face<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.570> run<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.380> you're<00:02:42.560> going<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:42.950> have

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
face this run so you're going you have

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.500 
face this run so you're going you have
six<00:02:43.340> down<00:02:43.520> defenders<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.210> kind<00:02:44.420> of

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
six down defenders that you can kind of

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.060 
six down defenders that you can kind of
manipulate<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.500> defense<00:02:45.650> side<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
manipulate on your defense side of the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
read-option so effective and this is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.970 
read-option so effective and this is
something<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.269> were<00:03:20.390> saying<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.690> me<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:21.200> couple

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
something you were saying to me a couple

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.890 
something you were saying to me a couple
weeks<00:03:22.160> ago<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:23.239> read-option<00:03:23.420> makes

weeks ago is that the read-option makes

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.170 
weeks ago is that the read-option makes
it<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.890> effective<00:03:25.400> because<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.820> takes<00:03:26.030> away

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
it is effective because it takes away

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.420 
it is effective because it takes away
one<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.690> safeties<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.830> literally

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
one of the safeties and it literally

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.070 
one of the safeties and it literally
creates<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.910> one-on-one<00:03:29.239> matchup<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.050> the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
creates a one-on-one matchup with the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.020 
creates a one-on-one matchup with the
one<00:03:30.380> remaining<00:03:30.590> safety<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.610> quarterback

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
one remaining safety and the quarterback

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.900 
one remaining safety and the quarterback
yes<00:03:32.480> that's<00:03:32.810> sort<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.860> what's<00:03:34.160> happening<00:03:34.640> here

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
yes that's sort of what's happening here

yes that's sort of what's happening here
there's<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.660> many<00:03:35.780> blocks<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.530> are

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
there's so many blocks that are

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.530 
there's so many blocks that are
happening<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.459> everyone<00:03:37.790> gets<00:03:37.940> matched<00:03:38.180> up

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
happening and everyone gets matched up

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.180 
happening and everyone gets matched up
that<00:03:39.080> will<00:03:39.200> end<00:03:39.230> up<00:03:39.470> happening<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.800> it's<00:03:39.980> only

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that will end up happening is it's only

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.920 
that will end up happening is it's only
one<00:03:40.489> key<00:03:40.820> defender<00:03:41.269> which<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> deep

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
one key defender which is the deep

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.750 
one key defender which is the deep
safety<00:03:42.350> that<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:42.950> have<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.310> really<00:03:43.459> kind<00:03:43.700> of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
safety that you have to really kind of

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.520 
safety that you have to really kind of
get<00:03:44.090> up<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.570> through<00:03:44.780> all<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.959> blocks<00:03:45.200> and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
get up get through all the blocks and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.290 
get up get through all the blocks and

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
make a clay on the running back so this

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.120 
make a clay on the running back so this
is<00:03:47.330> what<00:03:47.630> makes<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.170> there's<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.739> block<00:03:48.920> and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
is what makes and there's the block and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.250 
is what makes and there's the block and
there's<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.430> kick<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.959> what<00:03:51.140> is

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
there's the kick and go this is what is

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.830 
there's the kick and go this is what is
making<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.739> run<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.130> effective<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:52.760> what<00:03:53.720> we

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
making this run so effective so what we

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.540 
making this run so effective so what we
have<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.019> do<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.320> try<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.530> combat<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.370> we

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
have to do to try and combat this is we

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.850 
have to do to try and combat this is we
have<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.730> try<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> become<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.420> aggressor<00:03:57.140> when

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
have to try to become the aggressor when

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.470 
have to try to become the aggressor when
it<00:03:57.980> comes<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.370> trying<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.730> stop<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.150> counter

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
it comes to trying to stop the counter

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.420 
it comes to trying to stop the counter
so<00:03:59.720> what<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> mean<00:04:00.590> by<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:00.920> we<00:04:01.100> don't<00:04:01.220> want

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
so what I mean by that is we don't want

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.020 
so what I mean by that is we don't want
75<00:04:01.850> we<00:04:02.300> can't<00:04:02.840> let<00:04:02.959> 75<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.620> 74<00:04:04.070> kick<00:04:04.610> up<00:04:04.790> like

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
75 we can't let 75 and 74 kick up like

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.000 
75 we can't let 75 and 74 kick up like
that<00:04:05.209> right<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.870> we<00:04:06.110> need<00:04:06.320> now<00:04:06.560> need<00:04:06.769> on<00:04:06.890> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
that right so we need now need on the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.320 
that right so we need now need on the
defensive<00:04:07.550> say<00:04:07.700> up<00:04:07.820> we're<00:04:07.940> going<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.120> face

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
defensive say up we're going to face

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.150 
defensive say up we're going to face
this<00:04:08.600> front<00:04:09.080> let's<00:04:09.620> try<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:09.920> be<00:04:10.010> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
this front let's try and be the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.560 
this front let's try and be the
aggressor<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:10.610> see<00:04:10.820> if<00:04:10.880> we<00:04:10.970> can<00:04:11.120> get<00:04:11.209> any<00:04:11.390> type

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
aggressor and see if we can get any type

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.240 
aggressor and see if we can get any type
of<00:04:11.600> different<00:04:11.959> result<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.769> snap<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.190> ball

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
of different result so snap of the ball

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.640 
of different result so snap of the ball
you<00:04:13.549> run<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.790> over<00:04:13.850> there<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.420> time<00:04:14.650> 74
