that<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:03.390> jump<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that we can now well jump which is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.370 
that we can now well jump which is
pretty<00:01:04.320> cool<00:01:04.559> um<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> about<00:01:06.299> four<00:01:06.600> jumps<00:01:06.960> takes

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
pretty cool um so about four jumps takes

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130 
pretty cool um so about four jumps takes
us<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.689> height<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> don't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

wouldn't you propel yourself off of a
wall<00:01:20.100> using<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> wall<00:01:20.700> jump<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> basically

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
wall using the wall jump you basically

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
wall using the wall jump you basically
jump<00:01:21.509> into<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> wall<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.350> press

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
jump into the wall and then you press

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.679 
jump into the wall and then you press
spacebar<00:01:22.830> again<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.880> jump<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
spacebar again to jump off of it it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.780 
spacebar again to jump off of it it
throws<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.320> around<00:01:25.650> immediately<00:01:25.920> 180

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
throws you around immediately 180

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.870 
throws you around immediately 180
degrees<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.670> jump

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
degrees so as you can see here I jump

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.550 
degrees so as you can see here I jump
off<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> wall<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.720> I'm<00:01:30.900> facing<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
off the wall and now I'm facing this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
off the wall and now I'm facing this
direction<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> wall<00:01:32.310> behind<00:01:32.490> me<00:01:32.700> uh<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
direction with the wall behind me uh so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.630 
direction with the wall behind me uh so
that's<00:01:34.259> sort<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> how<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.710> works<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.159> terms<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that's sort of how it works in terms of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's sort of how it works in terms of
getting<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.210> wall<00:01:36.450> structure<00:01:36.900> right

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
getting up this wall structure right

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
getting up this wall structure right
here<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.710> jump<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.100> gonna<00:01:38.220> keep<00:01:38.400> flipping

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
here this jump it's gonna keep flipping

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
here this jump it's gonna keep flipping
me<00:01:39.060> around<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:40.110> we're<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.409> top<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
me around and now we're on top of the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
me around and now we're on top of the
structure<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.579> jumped<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> structure

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
structure or we jumped off the structure

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
structure or we jumped off the structure
or<00:01:42.570> whatever<00:01:42.720> whatever<00:01:43.409> happens<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> as

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
or whatever whatever happens to you as
