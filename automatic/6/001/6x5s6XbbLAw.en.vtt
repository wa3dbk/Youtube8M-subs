 explain how to download games 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.610
 It's free from web detects and it's good 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.160
 that we just started with the web that 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.690

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.090

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.870
 ask also in your help for 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 for the page to work, you do not have accounts 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.480

 we also want to help you 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.630
 a little bit with what it is to download games 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.920
 because sometimes it's very complicated 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.930
 download games because they are not 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.510
 all the images or we're leaving we like 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.040
 the page is very complicated to download 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.200
 not good games well with my factory 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.260
 dotcom game is what this web is called 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.880
 here you have the link this practically 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.130
 disappears because the web page itself is 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.310
 quite intuitive is pretty good 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.050
 neat and good the last 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.420
 snapshots published last 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.880
 games that are coming out we take care of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.409
 to pick them up and upload them to our website 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.259
 area so you can download it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.689
 first of all say so also that 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.609
 We have three outstanding websites worth 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.189
 do these the games then we have 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.140
 one that is my factoring a lot that is 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.990
 to download movies like this one 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 but also as with we were a little 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.509
 budget cuts we are going to include 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 streaming on this web page so that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.609
 you can watch movies in high definition 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.170
 and with quite good quality it's worth 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.490
 it is also very factor and files 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.649
 that it will be time possible to calculate 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.659
 as it was before, not as it is now because 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.659
 now the truth that good everyone 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.580
 show because I think we all do 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.410
 a slight idea of ​​what it's for 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.080
 Well, as you are saying, it's worth it here 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.730
 you have the index the page of the home of the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 by mike rodríguez puntocom 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.500
 for example we have here a 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.019
 slider is worth it if we want to enter 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.810
 for example to the post that is seen by 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.459

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.910
 images 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.890
 that is in if the intuitive web then 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.330
 we're going to this from here it's worth it 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.760
 we want without puncturing a game and 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.650
 we want to see it we do not have more than 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.230
 click on the image or the text in the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.270
 title of the game is worth and we see then nothing 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.370
 well the biggest cover one 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.050
 description of the game details 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.730
 technical system requirements 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.920
 and here are the four enlarged photos 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.290
 that we can also see them in a big way 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.330
 so then it is also in some 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.240
 youtube link you can download 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.310

 and also has those links then of 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.180
 different pages 9 feet server or from 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.470
 sure blog or the cloud is worth several 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.940
 then if we had instructions from 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.770
 installation we would have here but 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.360
 as for now there is no and then also 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.390
 Well, if you swim to discuss the games 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.340

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.750
 than the other websites 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.580
 Well, I do not know if they will come to have I think 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.490
 in principle this is not here that 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.440
 are petitions worth if we want and 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.440
 we have some doubt we want in a game 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.300
 we want you to leave some game not 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.690
 you have more to ask for here in this 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.670
 here in this comment after 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.400
 facebook you have more to write and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.780

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.790
 edition you have the game the crack that 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.800

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.470
 by categories here you see it by 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.720
 ps3 categories if we go to xbox 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.820

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.050
 categories likewise drive xbox in the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.050
 basically same web 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.439
 so this is quite intuitive then 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.960
 if we want new games then we're going 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.360

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:03.990
 they organize for the classics more what they 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.120
 they call classics of all life not and 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.620
 nothing this coming soon the truth 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.169
 that for now there is not much more than nothing 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.770
 because because right now it is not expected 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.699
 no game but as they leave 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.409
 are going out then that we have 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.180
 eating they go knowing news 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.650
 we are going to be putting there and the 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.240
 Game novelties are also here 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.949
 until the page itself is very 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.840
 intuitive and nothing we hope you like 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.120
 be at the top and factory game dotcom 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.280
 and so more than anything we can also 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.560
 and make the other webs that we have left 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.830
 that are basically intended for the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.100
 user are already in design and simply 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.330
 it is necessary to program them so that 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.040
 this is what they are going to do basically 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.220
 for example at least two of these 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.110
 music of files are thought to the hundred 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.889
 per cent by the user not easy 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.660
 fast and quality then nothing 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.180
 I just hope you liked it 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.400
