00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone with you pixel devil and before 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.170
 you set 76 041 for hydrophore cracks in 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.849
 It has 405 parts and now I will tell you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.849
 why I did not buy it 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.000
 honestly I have not found any reason 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 buy this whole set basically 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.830
 because it is not sold to us in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 Russia accordingly order it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.420
 from abroad expensive there it is sold 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 only on certain networks but generally 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.559
 this time I didn’t even understand where 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.930
 specifically because what difference are we with 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 you are here and it is not so important 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 it happens all the time that lego 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.829
 someone there in america or in europe 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.010
 buys the right to sell one of the sets 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.840
 rulers only in your store and its 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 nowhere else, respectively 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.890
 minifigures get hard if you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.109
 you live in Russia and it's all very difficult 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.320
 but I want to collect all the minifigures 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.629
 so began to study the issue more 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 detail in the first set alone 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.100
 nothing particularly interesting yourself 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.409
 I don’t even know where 405 is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.930
 parts it looks like parts 200 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 because all this fort is all 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.009
 this fortress consists of huge 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 the blocks are basically alternating 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.080
 in small details occasionally here here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.659
 cool yellow bush 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.299
 enough but okay it's not so weighty 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.600
 argument is a small gate tree and here 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.610
 this is another superhero car 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.979
 car is nothing interesting 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.960
 having perhaps the roof of her 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 An interesting device that costs 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.670
 shoots balls but similar all the details 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 you can find for example in the bionicle series 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.619
 generally unique parts 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.189
 the set is not there and what remains of course 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.060
 the same minifigures minifigures a lot of them 5 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.130
 pieces set 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.280
 very cool if you want to buy 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.680
 for example just him and he is available cool 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.340
 5 minifigures generally a great set 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.610
 but the minion of hydra already came across to us in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.950
 set with torus and falcon eye such 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.560
 dark green hulk came across to us already in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.770
 set with Hulkbaster captain america 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.800
 I came across a set of squirger 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.740
 there are 2 unique figures left 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.780
 baron von striker who was in the very 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.840
 early second avengers in the film 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.830
 how much do you remember in his hands the staff 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.440
 Loki by the way the staff Loki is exactly the same 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.930
 there is a set with the tower of the avengers then 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.120
 there is the figure itself is not very 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.970
 important but if you are a collector want 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.220
 collect all line minifigures then he 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 you just need the coolest 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.440
 of course the figurine set is this 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.210
 quiksilver mercury is of course a hero 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.490
 which not much time was spent 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.670
 the film is generally there with him is not very 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.070
 well happened and in general he is so 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.460
 turned out pretty faded in my opinion 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.070
 hero in the film but in terms of 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.710
 Marvel universe this hero for the first time 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.530
 there is a book of interpretation many of him 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.590
 love in the comics and here he appeared and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.750
 so how to get it very and 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.740
 I really wanted these two 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.920
 minifigures 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.920
 I ordered from abroad, they left me 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.640
 the price as half of this set is very 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.500
 dear honestly already the exact amount is not 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.540
 remember but nonetheless I don't care 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.360
 I think that I saved so I would get 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.700
 another bunch of repeated figures that I 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.060
 just no time to exchange sell or 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.459
 do something with them and a bunch of useless 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.670
 details I actually made my choice and 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.860
 ordered these two figures here you see them 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.890
 in front of me and now I will give you a detailed 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.230
 will show these two figures first will 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.100
 baron von striker is so fat 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.190
 villain minion hydra regular with him 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.190
 there is a hydra emblem even on a print on 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.060
 the body in front of him is silver shiny 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.990
 buckle on the belts and here is such 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.380
 bluish suit pale pale henny 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.250
 but there is a monocle on his evil face 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.820
 nothing really special but 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.250
 unique figure 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.620
 and here he is quiksilver which in Russian 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.870
 translated as mercury suit 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.840
 cool at first it glitters 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.690
 very cool shines very bright 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.480
 straight even blinded when you look under 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.270
 lamp on him to be honest with him 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.300
 In my opinion it is similar to the design of the Soviet 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.240
 condensed milk here are tin cans were 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.300
 condensed milk is very similar in my 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.130
 the rest is very good copies of his 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.010
 the hero of the movie is the same lush hairstyle 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:53.210
 white whether white or gray is the same 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:56.690
 face serious and bristly back there 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.720
 still angry and his face and quiksilver 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.930
 and his usual black pants 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.760
 unremarkable actually this 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.530
 all the guys that i wanted to show you in 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.330
 I don’t strongly recommend this video 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.840
 get upset that this set is not 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.289
 brought to us yes it is cool in the afternoon a lot 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.160
 minifigures are cool but you will need it 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.919
 only avid collector who 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.160
 only two minifigures are important for the most part 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.229
 the account and without it is not so bad if 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.200
 these minifigures are so important to you 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.930
 the road you on ebay and brick link and 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.300
 the rest is not worth it upset my 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.910
 loss of altron collection on this 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.729
 completed all the minifigures i have 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.139
 somehow be sure to put them all together 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.810
 I'll show you this 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.780
 the final video and as for hal 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.210
 career is still another series 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.550
 i would say this is not the age of altron and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.169
 in general in the era of altron xx or no career 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.470
 this is a separate set 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.450
 he is huge he is out of the series this is lego marvel 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.250
 but not the avenger 2 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.979
 the age of altron is rather the first 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.260
 Avengers in general set but it's not like that 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.110
 It is important I do not know whether this set will appear 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.940
 my program someday but this already 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.220
 completely different story 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.740
 on this I want to say goodbye to you thanks 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.080
 for your attention for now 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.960
 the main part of this set is still 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.970
 running gear its turning part like 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.720
 she did first everything in the springs 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.870
 front wheels on springs and rear 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.440
 the wheels are also on the springs 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.440
 everything
