you you load it you unload it in here

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
you you load it you unload it in here

shade after you shaking it well I would

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.560 
shade after you shaking it well I would
I<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.619> recommend<00:01:38.100> say<00:01:38.579> shaking<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> for

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I would recommend say shaking it for

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
I would recommend say shaking it for
about<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.780> minutes<00:01:40.259> 2<00:01:40.500> minutes<00:01:40.530> straight<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
about a minutes 2 minutes straight a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
about a minutes 2 minutes straight a
vigorous<00:01:42.180> shaking<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:43.140> since<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
vigorous shaking because since this is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
vigorous shaking because since this is
water-based<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.060> color<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> water<00:01:46.140> will

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
water-based the color and the water will

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
water-based the color and the water will
tend<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> separate<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> shake<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
