00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.130
 an icy and terrifying path cataloged 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.860
 as one of the most chilling routes 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.980
 of the world discover what sleeps under 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.839
 this sinister road 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.839
 the sinister routes 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.400
 i 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.040
 how 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.619
 Siberia Russia 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.179
 known simply as the route the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.120
 only existing road in a vast 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.890
 area of ​​Siberian Russia 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.390
 approximately 2000 km capable of joining 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.149
 what were two large cores 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.760
 commercial the Magadan cities and 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.619
 Jacuzzi same path that would facilitate 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.049
 Communist control throughout this vast 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.789
 territory and that would also serve as 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.320
 a way to transport the gold of the 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.320
 Siberian mines to the Pacific 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.900
 a journey built by orders of 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.390
 Stalin when still the Soviet Union 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.460
 sought to consolidate its power and influence 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.500
 in remote and extensive Siberia 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.330
 [Music] 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.670
 the construction of this highway 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.070
 trans-Siberian was one of the ways in 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.650
 which according to Stalin could get 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.950
 more power in the area but not only that 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 but it would act twice 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 sending thousands of dissidents from 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.350
 regime to perform hard work the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.350
 workforce 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.040
 Hundreds of people practically 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.950
 condemned to work hard from 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 the dawn until dusk a 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.660
 truly resistance work already 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 that it is well known that the great Siberia 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.680
 is considered as the seat of one of the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.680
 coldest places in the world 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.720
 [Music] 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.700
 we talk about a road trip that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.400
 it runs along the polar circle 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.350
 arctic where nature plays a 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.470
 important role in the survival of the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.470
 man 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.510
 ah 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.670
 the cold in winter in this area is so 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.950
 raised that dig a grave to give 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.290
 burial to the deceased is a whole 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.660
 chaos in the first place because of the fact that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.940
 the ground is literally 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.980
 frozen and what is even worse in the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 defrosting cycles presents 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.270
 a whole calamity little by little the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.850
 corpses already buried emerge from 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.590
 the depths to be thrown out of 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.590
 new account to the world of the living 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.480
 [Music] 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 the cold is so extreme that falling asleep 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.470
 for a couple of minutes 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.470
 irreparably dies is frozen 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.069
 it is because of this extreme weather that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.680
 the workers who were sentenced to 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.750
 build that famous route they died 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.200
 one after another victims of freezing 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.659
 a truly painful enemy that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.659
 it left them practically immobilized 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.410
 thousands of workers died 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.150
 precisely on this route a route 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.890
 sinister in which it is stated that everything 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.140
 that worker who lost his life 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.660
 it was simply placed under 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.420
 foundations of the road itself a 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.850
 historical event that to date 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.320
 constitutes one of the greatest genocides 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.830
 in the history of constructions 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.830
 human 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.140
 said road besides being 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.420
 considered the most chilling of the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.599
 world is also one of the most 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.599
 dangerous 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.070
 being the only possible way to 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.410
 get to the jacuzzi and despite the risks of 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.330
 your travel thousands of people look 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.700
 forced to cover it by putting into play 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.070
 their lives besides the rains of the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.750
 summer are usually very abundant and the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.240
 path becomes a true 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.130
 Mud swamp is where thousands of 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.770
 vehicles are often stranded by 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.420
 weeks 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.490
 [Music] 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.250
 To make matters worse there is a stretch of 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.680
 approximately 30 km of what is said 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.180
 strange accidents happen where 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.860
 none of the drivers or 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.220
 companions who get to survive 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.290
 they manage to remember what happened describing 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.690
 only strange black spots that 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.960
 begin to cloud your sight before 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.960
 accident 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.320
 some of the theories describe and 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.930
 They suspect possible leaks 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.810
 underground gases that affect 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.310
 said drivers and companions 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.229
 causing them to remember nothing 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.229
 of what happened during the accident 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.640
 although others are those who claim that 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.440
 the cause of these strange accidents is 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.750
 they owe ghosts and specters that 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.920
 they still remain in that 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.920
 spooky place 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.600
 this is nice head good night
