 my main enemy on the road is alcohol 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.979
 crazy cops with IDs 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.700

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.860
 roof 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.370
 you know the question is where does the money come from 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.590

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.750
 corrupt zadolbali already but really 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.640
 zadolbali now in Georgia were broke 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.030
 a car on the road is approaching the police 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.740

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.510

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.850
 I stand here so lowered I think 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:17.630
 how lats is that it is in Georgia 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.520

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.540
 driving culture is now at sea 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.040
 but we have here at all not in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.420
 Belarus two times I had not 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.490
 it turned out to talk I am in a hurry 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.800
 I give my regards to flaming all sinners 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.230
 who tried to chase with eric 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.450
 Davidovich agrees with them offensively 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:42.650
 when he has 700 horses you have 200 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.540
 I agree I apologize more 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.730
 cheeky 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.560
 our country but no one knows him 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.239
 but at the same time the bravest driver on 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.400
 public roads makes that 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.849
 a situation in which I will 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.500
 it's impossible to drive 300 there in a city 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.689
 and it will be impossible for all to be done 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.629
 that the situation will be changed I donate 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:04.209
 my love racing on the road in order 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.040
 to save all the rest of the soul here I teach 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.319
 themselves to ride 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.569
 without breaking the city well 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.349
 very much if everyone thinks that we are some 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.629
 Robin Hoods refinements and I just want 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.750
 suck up the face of grumpy employees 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.400
 the police will not be very surprised 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.319
 when I show the other side of morality 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.209
 sundae ballet inspector will be on 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.129
 equipment and people who will be it 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.909
 stop poking ksivy poke 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.590
 money we will punish them of course I 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.610
 I earn from views 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.070
 but 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.200
 what is earned from views 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.510
 you can not even pay operator salary 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.390
 the basic principle of making money is 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.670
 sales advertising in the automotive field 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.470
 but here, too, I have a problem well in 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.360

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.040
 especially rich dealers for example 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.850
 when i did the first bmw m5 review 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.220
 bodywork f10 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.590

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.060

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.520
 the same nonsense safer Lexus I do not 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.520

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.440

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.190
 cars on this nothing 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.990
 you don't make money on it 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.150
 you can earn a million dollars here 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.949

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.770
