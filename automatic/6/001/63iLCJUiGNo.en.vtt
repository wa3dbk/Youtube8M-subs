00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.990
 hello my name is nikolai ascolov 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.599
 in this lesson we will deal with you 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:33.860
 small guitar face that is being built 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:36.129
 principle in b major is used with 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 using doping calculated consider 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.970
 how are we going to play him here for 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.589
 Begin to put your fingers on the right we need 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.720
 frets this is the first finger 2 little finger 12 14 16 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.600
 fret and we will use dope second 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.430
 finger on 17 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 so we will play with you here 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.540
 why we put 1 finger here because 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.059
 that now for example we will not be this 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.920
 use but still we have it here 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.989
 with you in advance we put in order for us 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.189
 it was then convenient to hold this 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.290
 fingering on the next string 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:13.520
 we will play with you not on the seventeenth 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.490
 year 19 begins 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 the passage so that we ourselves put a finger 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 on 19 frets tepping right right hand and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.470
 do deterrence 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.740
 falls further 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.320
 in the second finger on four chairs and do 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.780
 16 watt cameras and add beijing then 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 again pool and it turns out like a phrase 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.930
 now let's take some duplicate 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.760
 that is 119 frets then 18 from 1918 1918 inside 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.040
 while here in the left hand without changing 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 not changing the first finger yet and we are not 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.690
 We play, that is, it turns out 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.420
 played now add another trapping 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.939
 bull do we author finger 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.490
 do the camera stepping again on the 19th 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.050
 make a bull to the second finger afterwards 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.530
 again tapping another from you that part 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.530
 such a phrase 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.670
 unless of course fast paced play 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.670
 it turns out quite interesting to study 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.030
 bonus when you can still show what 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.640
 how to duplicate stepping on one 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.270
 string ace and left hand and right hand 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.190
 more precisely, too, it turns out as it is not quite 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.480
 not double trapping it turns you 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.480
 we duplicate one note 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.420
 principle a little bit another topic 8 we will 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:01.749
 the planet is very with us we are with you 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:03.340
 collect played this passage and then here 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.739
 as soon as we will move on 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.780
 the second string we start with tugging already 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.750
 to the first fingers that is draw 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.599
 attention to the fact that when we played 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.299
 just alternated attacking 1918 1518 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.319
 then the floor we did only up to 14 frets 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.319
 now we will do 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.560
 in the transition to the second side, we are already with 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.300
 you grab 1 finger that is a pool and 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.989
 we go to the first finger liabilities 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.989
 we got 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.670
 for the second round we are not playing 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.800
 exactly the same frets only there already have 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.160
 we have no alternation space 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.160
 plays 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.760
 and repeat 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.270
 as soon as we made this artur 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.490
 and arrive at the second finger for 14 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.830
 then add a taping on the 17th fret 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.319
 we lower it I do a pool the second finger 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.350
 do the hammer a little finger 16 taylor 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:24.310
 then again add the floor dumping on 19 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:26.650
 fret do the pools in the second finger then 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.850
 this 18 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.850
 turned out not worse 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.770
 Now do the trapping here 17 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.550
 done getting the first finger then 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.550
 do typing in 16th way 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:58.669
 go to 9 slides then play 

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.019
 play simple form 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.730
 here we get were in hand 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.950
 static finger position ie 911 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.410
 our right hand is constantly 16 and we 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.360
 moving first first string 2 3 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:22.139
 then 2 3 4 further guessed already 3 4 5 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.680
 and 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.310
 and here we can make you do 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.310
 38 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.300
 possible against the tonic case gets 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.300
 here 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.499
 he 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.870
 if you work under the metronome then we 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.090
 metronome finger memory will memory storage memory 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.050
 either for the time being one metronome hit 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.050
 us two fingers 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.490
 only at the very end we already 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.000
 It turns out 3 such interest and passages 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.000
 turned out 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.620
 I wish you success and repeat it bye
