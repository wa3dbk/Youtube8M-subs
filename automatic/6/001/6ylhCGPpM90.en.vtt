Wallabies<00:00:07.680> have<00:00:07.799> made<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.160> clear<00:00:08.280> they<00:00:08.519> want

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Wallabies have made it clear they want

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.160 
Wallabies have made it clear they want
to<00:00:08.730> play<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.120> expansive<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.840> up-tempo

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
to play with an expansive and up-tempo

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.990 
to play with an expansive and up-tempo
game<00:00:10.500> plan<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.010> doesn't<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.849> mean

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
game plan that doesn't just mean

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
game plan that doesn't just mean
flinging<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> ball<00:00:12.719> wide<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.620> there<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
flinging the ball wide and there are a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.259 
flinging the ball wide and there are a
number<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.190> elements<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.670> need<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> work

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
number of elements that need to work

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.970 
number of elements that need to work
together<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.500> effective

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
together if it's going to be effective

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.859 
together if it's going to be effective
for<00:00:17.160> example<00:00:17.940> if<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.180> gonna<00:00:18.270> play<00:00:18.510> offset

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
for example if you're gonna play offset

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200 
for example if you're gonna play offset
piece<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.320> need<00:00:19.439> clean<00:00:19.770> ball<00:00:19.980> delivered<00:00:20.400> your

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
piece you need clean ball delivered your

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
piece you need clean ball delivered your
10<00:00:21.449> needs<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> move<00:00:22.080> forward<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.769> hold<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
10 needs to move forward to hold the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
10 needs to move forward to hold the
defence<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.390> shovel<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> ball

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
defence and not just shovel the ball

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.439 
defence and not just shovel the ball
sideways<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.980> saw<00:00:26.160> last<00:00:26.279> weekend<00:00:26.880> there

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
sideways like we saw last weekend there

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.060 
sideways like we saw last weekend there
needs<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:28.050> variation<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.710> angles

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
needs to be some variation in angles

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.859 
needs to be some variation in angles
from<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> midfield<00:00:29.580> runners<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.689> not

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
from the midfield runners so that not

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.209 
from the midfield runners so that not
all<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.230> players<00:00:31.500> are<00:00:31.679> running<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:32.040> one

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
all of your players are running on one

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.030 
all of your players are running on one
angle<00:00:32.520> towards<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> sidelines<00:00:33.620> if<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.860> 10

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
angle towards the sidelines if your 10

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
angle towards the sidelines if your 10
keeps<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> attack<00:00:35.850> straight<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.510> then

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
keeps the attack straight and then

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.389 
keeps the attack straight and then
you've<00:00:37.140> got<00:00:37.320> changes<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.890> angles<00:00:38.219> from

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you've got changes in angles from

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
you've got changes in angles from
different<00:00:38.760> runners<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.809> preserve<00:00:40.260> space<00:00:40.590> out

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
different runners you preserve space out

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.920 
different runners you preserve space out
wide<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.550> start<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> stress<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> defense

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
wide and you start to stress the defense

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.049 
wide and you start to stress the defense
obviously<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.129> believe<00:00:44.489> you've<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> get

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
obviously I believe you've got to get

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
obviously I believe you've got to get
numbers<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.750> attacking<00:00:46.079> rocks<00:00:46.379> early

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
numbers into your attacking rocks early

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.049 
numbers into your attacking rocks early
and<00:00:47.070> those<00:00:47.190> players<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> be

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and those players have got to be

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
and those players have got to be
effective<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> protect<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.260> ball<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.250> do

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
effective to protect your ball if you do

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610 
effective to protect your ball if you do
that<00:00:50.610> you'll<00:00:51.030> produce<00:00:51.180> quick<00:00:51.719> clean<00:00:52.199> ball<00:00:52.379> for

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that you'll produce quick clean ball for

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
that you'll produce quick clean ball for
the<00:00:52.680> next<00:00:52.710> phase<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> take<00:00:54.000> advantage<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the next phase but to take advantage of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
the next phase but to take advantage of
quick<00:00:54.809> ball<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.199> need<00:00:55.320> players<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.920> realign

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
quick ball you need players to realign

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
quick ball you need players to realign
quickly<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.000> there<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.239> multiple<00:00:57.420> options<00:00:57.780> on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
quickly so there are multiple options on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
quickly so there are multiple options on
the<00:00:58.260> next<00:00:58.500> phase<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.980> course<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.789> work

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the next phase of course all that work

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
the next phase of course all that work
setting<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.480> opportunities<00:01:01.079> means<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.739> if

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
setting up opportunities means little if

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
setting up opportunities means little if
you<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.699> execute<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.080> have

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you then don't execute well if you have

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
you then don't execute well if you have
poor<00:01:04.409> passes<00:01:05.010> dropped<00:01:05.460> balls<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:06.299> players<00:01:06.689> not

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
poor passes dropped balls or players not

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020 
poor passes dropped balls or players not
making<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.500> decisions<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.820> pretty

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
making the right decisions it's pretty

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.640 
making the right decisions it's pretty
basic<00:01:09.240> stuff<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.049> didn't<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> lot<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
basic stuff but we didn't see a lot of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.960 
basic stuff but we didn't see a lot of
it<00:01:10.799> from<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> Wallabies<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> weekend

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
let's have a look at some examples where

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
let's have a look at some examples where
we<00:01:13.770> did<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.760> Wallabies<00:01:15.150> line<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.509> was

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
we did the Wallabies line out was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
we did the Wallabies line out was
excellent<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> weekend<00:01:16.590> providing<00:01:17.009> good

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
excellent on the weekend providing good

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550 
excellent on the weekend providing good
clean<00:01:17.549> ball<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.060> here's<00:01:18.240> another<00:01:18.330> example<00:01:18.560> we

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
clean ball and here's another example we

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
clean ball and here's another example we
can<00:01:19.680> also<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.159> Tamara<00:01:20.490> moving<00:01:20.909> forward<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
can also see Tamara moving forward to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
can also see Tamara moving forward to
engage<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> defense<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> hold<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.640> which

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
engage the defense and hold them which

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.429 
engage the defense and hold them which
he<00:01:24.090> did<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.390> better<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> second<00:01:25.229> half

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
he did a lot better in the second half

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
he did a lot better in the second half
he's<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.220> O'Connor<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.759> behind<00:01:27.060> him<00:01:27.180> Leela

the four words for this ruck so it's

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.420

here's another wide ruck and we've just

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.649 
here's another wide ruck and we've just

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
seen Moana and Hooper protecting the

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.969 
seen Moana and Hooper protecting the
ball<00:04:37.810> on<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> left<00:04:38.080> side<00:04:38.439> of<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.620> field

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
ball on the left side of the field

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.499 
ball on the left side of the field
now<00:04:39.250> McMenamin<00:04:39.789> is<00:04:39.879> in<00:04:39.969> the<00:04:40.060> rock<00:04:40.240> on<00:04:40.419> the

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
now McMenamin is in the rock on the

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.270 
now McMenamin is in the rock on the
right<00:04:40.659> side<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.169> Marlin<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.889> Hooper<00:04:42.189> have

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
right side and Marlin and Hooper have

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.770 
right side and Marlin and Hooper have
got<00:04:42.460> across<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.789> that<00:04:42.939> side<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.389> field<00:04:43.569> as

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
got across to that side of the field as

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.390 
got across to that side of the field as
well<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.439> now<00:04:44.590> we've<00:04:44.770> got<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.069> back<00:04:45.219> row

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
well so now we've got the back row

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.980 
well so now we've got the back row
working<00:04:45.669> in<00:04:45.909> a<00:04:46.000> combination<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:46.659> that's<00:04:46.780> very

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
working in a combination and that's very

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.839 
working in a combination and that's very
effective<00:04:47.319> here<00:04:47.889> with<00:04:48.099> Hooper<00:04:48.400> carrying<00:04:48.759> the

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
effective here with Hooper carrying the

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.640 
effective here with Hooper carrying the
ball<00:04:49.060> it's<00:04:49.419> Mullen<00:04:49.900> that's<00:04:50.080> first<00:04:50.319> into<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
ball it's Mullen that's first into the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.920 
ball it's Mullen that's first into the
attacking<00:04:50.979> ruck<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.610> that's<00:04:52.180> giving<00:04:52.509> us<00:04:52.599> good

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
attacking ruck and that's giving us good

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.020 
attacking ruck and that's giving us good
quick<00:04:53.349> clean<00:04:53.680> ball<00:04:53.949> and<00:04:54.189> allowing<00:04:54.879> each

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
quick clean ball and allowing each

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.700 
quick clean ball and allowing each
runner<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.449> get<00:04:55.569> over<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.900> gain<00:04:56.110> line<00:04:56.289> first

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
runner to get over the gain line first

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.469 
runner to get over the gain line first
it's<00:04:56.979> Alexander<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.699> then<00:04:57.789> it's<00:04:57.939> Hall

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
it's Alexander and then it's Hall

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.050 
it's Alexander and then it's Hall
now<00:04:59.080> as<00:04:59.229> hauls<00:04:59.469> tackled<00:05:00.099> it's<00:05:00.460> Reed<00:05:00.789> that's

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
now as hauls tackled it's Reed that's

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.029 
now as hauls tackled it's Reed that's
first<00:05:01.300> on<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.629> ball<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.289> that's<00:05:02.500> because<00:05:02.889> the

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
first on the ball and that's because the

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.740 
first on the ball and that's because the
support<00:05:03.580> players<00:05:03.819> are<00:05:04.030> just<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.300> little<00:05:04.599> behind

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
support players are just a little behind

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.659 
support players are just a little behind
the<00:05:05.110> ball<00:05:05.289> carrier<00:05:05.710> opening<00:05:06.430> up<00:05:06.520> that

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
the ball carrier opening up that

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.550 
the ball carrier opening up that
opportunity<00:05:06.940> now<00:05:07.629> because<00:05:07.930> Reed<00:05:08.169> was<00:05:08.319> on<00:05:08.440> the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
opportunity now because Reed was on the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.140 
opportunity now because Reed was on the
ball<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:08.979> early<00:05:09.310> he's<00:05:09.490> in<00:05:09.669> really<00:05:09.969> good

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
ball so early he's in really good

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.209 
ball so early he's in really good
position<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:11.139> takes<00:05:11.379> three<00:05:11.800> Wallaby

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
position and it takes three Wallaby

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.920 
position and it takes three Wallaby
forwards<00:05:12.639> to<00:05:12.789> eventually<00:05:13.240> get<00:05:13.389> Reed<00:05:13.629> off<00:05:13.780> his

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
forwards to eventually get Reed off his

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.990 
forwards to eventually get Reed off his
feet<00:05:14.199> but<00:05:14.680> he's<00:05:14.830> already<00:05:15.069> had<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.490> effect<00:05:15.819> of

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
feet but he's already had the effect of

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.420 
feet but he's already had the effect of
slowing<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.419> wallabies<00:05:16.810> ball<00:05:17.050> down<00:05:17.430> mcore

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
slowing the wallabies ball down mcore

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.920 
slowing the wallabies ball down mcore
and<00:05:18.580> white<00:05:18.729> Locke<00:05:18.940> then<00:05:19.150> believe<00:05:19.419> they<00:05:19.599> see<00:05:19.659> an

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
and white Locke then believe they see an

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.540 
and white Locke then believe they see an
opportunity<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.500> go<00:05:20.770> in<00:05:20.949> for<00:05:21.159> which<00:05:21.310> they're

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
opportunity and go in for which they're

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.700 
opportunity and go in for which they're
penalized<00:05:22.029> as<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:22.629> can<00:05:22.750> see<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.110> margins<00:05:23.560> as

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
penalized as you can see the margins as

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.990 
penalized as you can see the margins as
to<00:05:23.860> who's<00:05:24.039> first<00:05:24.370> into<00:05:24.699> the<00:05:24.789> ruck<00:05:24.969> and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
to who's first into the ruck and

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.550 
to who's first into the ruck and
therefore<00:05:25.509> has<00:05:25.689> the<00:05:25.719> best<00:05:26.050> position<00:05:26.529> to

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
therefore has the best position to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.070 
therefore has the best position to
either<00:05:27.129> protect<00:05:27.639> your<00:05:27.819> ball<00:05:27.969> or<00:05:28.419> to<00:05:28.689> slow<00:05:28.930> the

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
either protect your ball or to slow the

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.019 
either protect your ball or to slow the
opposition<00:05:29.560> ball<00:05:29.770> down<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.129> pretty<00:05:30.340> fine<00:05:30.789> I

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
opposition ball down is pretty fine I

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.999 
opposition ball down is pretty fine I
think<00:05:31.569> this<00:05:31.719> segment<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.139> play<00:05:32.289> shows<00:05:32.620> us<00:05:32.830> what

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
think this segment of play shows us what

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.290 
think this segment of play shows us what
the<00:05:33.099> Wallabies<00:05:33.340> are<00:05:33.550> trying<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:34.029> do<00:05:34.150> with

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
the Wallabies are trying to do with

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.119 
the Wallabies are trying to do with
their<00:05:34.449> attacking<00:05:34.750> plane<00:05:35.080> if<00:05:35.560> it's<00:05:35.770> gonna<00:05:35.919> work

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
their attacking plane if it's gonna work

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.860 
their attacking plane if it's gonna work
in<00:05:36.340> bladders<00:05:36.639> like<00:05:36.789> -<00:05:37.060> here<00:05:37.569> are<00:05:37.659> the<00:05:37.690> things

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
in bladders like - here are the things

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.170 
in bladders like - here are the things
I'd<00:05:38.110> focus<00:05:38.349> on<00:05:38.650> one<00:05:38.979> getting<00:05:39.759> those<00:05:39.909> players

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
I'd focus on one getting those players

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.790 
I'd focus on one getting those players
into<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:40.569> attacking<00:05:40.930> rocks<00:05:41.259> early<00:05:41.680> to

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
into the attacking rocks early to

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.129 
into the attacking rocks early to
protect<00:05:42.129> the<00:05:42.219> ball<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:43.150> better<00:05:43.599> running<00:05:43.870> lines

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
protect the ball to better running lines

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.079 
protect the ball to better running lines
from<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.500> support<00:05:44.889> players<00:05:45.159> to<00:05:45.729> put<00:05:45.879> some

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
from the support players to put some

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.909 
from the support players to put some
doubt<00:05:46.360> into<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.750> All<00:05:46.990> Blacks<00:05:47.110> defense<00:05:47.650> and

doubt into the All Blacks defense and

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.810 
doubt into the All Blacks defense and
three<00:05:48.370> better<00:05:49.060> execution
