00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
before I actually started reading it I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.240 
before I actually started reading it I
was<00:02:13.290> flipping<00:02:13.560> through<00:02:13.830> looking<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.130> the

was flipping through looking at the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.740 
was flipping through looking at the
pictures<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.880> there<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.330> picture<00:02:15.540> in

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
pictures and there was one picture in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
pictures and there was one picture in
particular<00:02:15.810> where<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.500> recognized<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.310> you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
particular where I recognized that you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.740 
particular where I recognized that you
are<00:02:17.460> definitely<00:02:17.670> thin<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> thought

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
are definitely thin but the thought

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.600 
are definitely thin but the thought
popped<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.050> my<00:02:19.140> head<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.980> her<00:02:20.160> legs<00:02:20.400> look

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
popped in my head and her legs look

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.190 
popped in my head and her legs look
great<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.120> wish<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.510> legs<00:02:21.750> looked<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.080> little

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
great I wish my legs looked a little

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.470 
great I wish my legs looked a little
more<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:23.550> actually<00:02:24.060> reading

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
more like that and then actually reading

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.170 
more like that and then actually reading
the<00:02:24.690> book<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.290> realized<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.910> had

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the book I realized that you had

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.880 
the book I realized that you had
alternated<00:02:27.840> those<00:02:28.080> photos<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
alternated those photos with a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.500 
alternated those photos with a
conversation<00:02:29.520> with<00:02:29.640> your<00:02:29.730> doctor<00:02:29.790> where<00:02:30.360> he

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
conversation with your doctor where he

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.880 
conversation with your doctor where he
was<00:02:30.630> basically<00:02:30.840> telling<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.800> were

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
was basically telling you you were

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.220 
was basically telling you you were
destroying<00:02:32.370> your<00:02:32.610> body<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.540> look<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.990> that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
destroying your body to look like that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.260 
destroying your body to look like that
and<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.100> really<00:02:35.220> powerful<00:02:35.340> moment

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and that was a really powerful moment

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.540 
and that was a really powerful moment
for<00:02:36.300> me<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.930> made<00:02:37.410> me<00:02:37.500> realize<00:02:37.530> these<00:02:38.100> images

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
for me and made me realize these images

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.060 
for me and made me realize these images
are<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.030> deceiving<00:02:39.780> yeah<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> want<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.220

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
had a chance to develop before they even

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.610 
had a chance to develop before they even

get curves and become women they are
held<00:03:07.620> up<00:03:07.860> as<00:03:08.070> images<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.510> perfect<00:03:10.080> ideal

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
held up as images of the perfect ideal

held up as images of the perfect ideal
female<00:03:11.400> form<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.239> its<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.320> really

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
female form and its really really

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.000 
female form and its really really
damaging<00:03:14.430> because<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.930> 40<00:03:16.440> year<00:03:16.560> old<00:03:16.650> woman

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
damaging because as a 40 year old woman

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.860 
damaging because as a 40 year old woman
as<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> 30<00:03:17.580> year<00:03:17.670> old<00:03:17.760> woman<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.270> should<00:03:18.540> not<00:03:18.720> be

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
as a 30 year old woman we should not be

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.040 
as a 30 year old woman we should not be
looking<00:03:19.200> at<00:03:19.290> little<00:03:19.530> kids<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.220> try<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.489> emulate

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
looking at little kids to try to emulate

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.600 
looking at little kids to try to emulate
their<00:03:22.050> bodies<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.860> just<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.370> there's

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
their bodies it's just if there's

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.400 
their bodies it's just if there's
something<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.180> really<00:03:24.660> wrong<00:03:25.020> with<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
something really really wrong with that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.720 
something really really wrong with that
yep<00:03:25.770> um<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:28.170> also<00:03:28.350> think<00:03:28.800> that<00:03:28.890> airbrushing

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
yep um and I also think that airbrushing

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.460 
yep um and I also think that airbrushing
is<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.480> real<00:03:30.900> problem

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
is a real problem

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.640 
is a real problem
because<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.970> know<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.270> order<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:34.140> order<00:03:34.470> to

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
because you know in order to in order to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.949 
because you know in order to in order to
be<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.130> ideal<00:03:35.520> image<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.420> dye<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.630> I

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
be that ideal image you have to dye it I

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.020 
be that ideal image you have to dye it I
mean<00:03:37.080> there's<00:03:37.290> no<00:03:37.470> there's<00:03:38.040> no<00:03:38.250> way<00:03:38.430> around<00:03:38.580> it

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
mean there's no there's no way around it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.510 
mean there's no there's no way around it
and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.560> know<00:03:40.680> they<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.010> always<00:03:41.100> kind

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
and then you know they can always kind

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.040 
and then you know they can always kind
of<00:03:41.610> cover<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.970> up<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.270> smooth<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.750> over<00:03:42.870> and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
of cover it up and smooth it over and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.340
