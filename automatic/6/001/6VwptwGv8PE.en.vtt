although I would love if there was the
reason<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> don't<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.829> an<00:01:53.100> SD<00:01:53.490> card<00:01:53.520> slot<00:01:54.180> being

ipad 2 features both likely and unlikely
and<00:03:24.010> against<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.519> very<00:03:24.790> very<00:03:25.090> easy<00:03:25.359> to<00:03:25.599> do

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
and against it is very very easy to do

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.479 
and against it is very very easy to do
because<00:03:26.139> all<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:27.010> do<00:03:27.129> is<00:03:27.310> basically

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
because all you have to do is basically

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.189 
because all you have to do is basically
say<00:03:27.790> it's<00:03:27.909> going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.180> SS<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.930> slightly

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
say it's going to have SS and slightly

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.930 
say it's going to have SS and slightly
more<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.280> all<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.609> sudden<00:03:30.879> you

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
more of that and all of a sudden you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.629 
more of that and all of a sudden you
have<00:03:31.150> some<00:03:31.419> potentially<00:03:32.079> credible<00:03:32.409> rumors<00:03:32.639> so

have some potentially credible rumors so

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.220 
have some potentially credible rumors so
it's<00:03:33.819> very<00:03:33.879> easy<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.510> do<00:03:34.629> considering<00:03:35.139> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
it's very easy to do considering the

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
cameras i just feel that these kinds of

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.640 
cameras i just feel that these kinds of
devices<00:05:06.279> are<00:05:06.939> not<00:05:07.180> conducive<00:05:07.629> to<00:05:07.900> having<00:05:08.259> rear

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
devices are not conducive to having rear

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.070 
devices are not conducive to having rear
facing<00:05:09.039> cameras<00:05:09.639> on<00:05:09.819> them<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.360> i<00:05:10.689> would<00:05:10.900> not

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
facing cameras on them and i would not

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.200 
facing cameras on them and i would not
like<00:05:11.289> to<00:05:11.319> see<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:11.830> on<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.669> next<00:05:12.789> generation

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
like to see that on the next generation

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.480

ipad<00:05:13.509> and<00:05:13.719> in<00:05:13.810> fact<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.349> wouldn't<00:05:14.979> be<00:05:15.069> surprised

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
ipad and in fact I wouldn't be surprised

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.390 
ipad and in fact I wouldn't be surprised
if<00:05:15.789> Apple<00:05:16.300> left<00:05:16.719> this<00:05:17.080> out<00:05:17.289> because<00:05:18.069> with

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
if Apple left this out because with

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.909 
if Apple left this out because with
Apple<00:05:18.819> is<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.509> small<00:05:19.930> degree<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.289> less<00:05:20.499> is<00:05:20.680> more

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
Apple is a small degree of less is more

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.739 
Apple is a small degree of less is more
and<00:05:21.159> it<00:05:21.580> might<00:05:21.759> even<00:05:21.939> be<00:05:22.029> considered<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.569> kind

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
and it might even be considered a kind

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.540 
and it might even be considered a kind
of<00:05:22.779> at<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:23.110> key<00:05:23.259> feature<00:05:23.439> so<00:05:24.039> let<00:05:24.219> me<00:05:24.279> know<00:05:24.400> if

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
of at a key feature so let me know if

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.339 
of at a key feature so let me know if
you<00:05:24.699> want<00:05:24.939> to<00:05:24.999> see<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.240> rear<00:05:25.569> facing<00:05:25.599> camera<00:05:26.199> on

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
you want to see a rear facing camera on

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.929 
you want to see a rear facing camera on
the<00:05:26.589> iPad<00:05:27.099> person<00:05:27.490> you're<00:05:27.610> not<00:05:27.699> going<00:05:27.819> to<00:05:27.879> be

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
the iPad person you're not going to be

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.790 
the iPad person you're not going to be
using<00:05:28.060> is<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.509> type<00:05:28.810> of<00:05:28.839> photography<00:05:29.169> camera

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
using is that type of photography camera

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.490 
using is that type of photography camera
so<00:05:30.310> you<00:05:30.849> know<00:05:30.969> your<00:05:31.330> iphone<00:05:31.870> is<00:05:32.050> probably<00:05:32.319> more

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
so you know your iphone is probably more

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.950 
so you know your iphone is probably more
than<00:05:32.650> good<00:05:32.800> enough<00:05:32.860> for<00:05:33.189> that<00:05:33.599> let's<00:05:34.599> move<00:05:34.779> on

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
than good enough for that let's move on

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.749 
than good enough for that let's move on
now<00:05:35.199> to<00:05:35.229> talk<00:05:35.620> about<00:05:35.860> some<00:05:36.279> other<00:05:36.370> rumoured

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
now to talk about some other rumoured

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.459 
now to talk about some other rumoured
features<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.270> ipad<00:05:37.599> 2<00:05:37.810> which<00:05:38.020> are<00:05:38.169> probably

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
features the ipad 2 which are probably

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.740 
features the ipad 2 which are probably
less<00:05:38.710> likely<00:05:39.219> in<00:05:39.370> my<00:05:39.550> opinion<00:05:39.909> an<00:05:40.270> SD<00:05:40.719> card

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
less likely in my opinion an SD card

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.579 
less likely in my opinion an SD card
slot<00:05:41.409> USB<00:05:42.250> port<00:05:42.789> very<00:05:43.089> unlikely<00:05:43.589> retina

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589 
slot USB port very unlikely retina

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:49.110 
slot USB port very unlikely retina
display<00:05:45.149> and<00:05:46.149> a<00:05:46.300> mini<00:05:46.479> DisplayPort<00:05:47.969> so<00:05:48.969> the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
display and a mini DisplayPort so the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.629 
display and a mini DisplayPort so the
big<00:05:49.300> question<00:05:49.449> is<00:05:49.899> when<00:05:50.349> when<00:05:51.039> are<00:05:51.339> we<00:05:51.490> going

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
big question is when when are we going

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.570 
big question is when when are we going
to<00:05:51.669> see<00:05:51.879> the<00:05:52.089> ipad<00:05:52.240> 2<00:05:52.839> well<00:05:53.560> if<00:05:53.830> you<00:05:54.430> believe

some<00:05:55.300> rumor<00:05:55.779> websites<00:05:56.259> it<00:05:56.529> could<00:05:56.889> be<00:05:57.069> as<00:05:57.159> early

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
some rumor websites it could be as early

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.329 
some rumor websites it could be as early
as<00:05:57.639> next<00:05:57.879> week<00:05:58.089> but<00:05:58.810> let's<00:05:58.990> be<00:05:59.169> honest<00:05:59.500> this<00:05:59.979> is

the
wings<00:06:36.580> at<00:06:36.760> Apple<00:06:37.110> but<00:06:38.110> if<00:06:38.320> i<00:06:38.500> was<00:06:38.620> to<00:06:38.650> speculate

myself<00:06:39.639> and<00:06:39.910> this<00:06:40.030> is<00:06:40.180> all<00:06:40.389> this<00:06:40.870> is<00:06:41.220> on<00:06:42.220> what<00:06:42.910> a

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
myself and this is all this is on what a

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.590 
myself and this is all this is on what a
safe<00:06:43.480> bet<00:06:43.900> on<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:45.250> launch<00:06:45.460> of<00:06:45.639> the<00:06:45.730> ipad<00:06:46.060> 2<00:06:46.330> i

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
safe bet on the launch of the ipad 2 i

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.490 
safe bet on the launch of the ipad 2 i
would<00:06:47.169> probably<00:06:47.590> say<00:06:48.180> inclusive<00:06:49.350> februari<00:06:50.350> to

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
would probably say inclusive februari to

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.180 
would probably say inclusive februari to
march<00:06:51.030> so<00:06:52.030> that<00:06:52.810> entire<00:06:53.230> block<00:06:53.620> those<00:06:53.919> two

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
march so that entire block those two

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.800 
march so that entire block those two
months<00:06:54.580> so<00:06:54.880> basically<00:06:55.240> this<00:06:55.389> month<00:06:55.660> in<00:06:55.780> the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
months so basically this month in the

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.060 
months so basically this month in the
end<00:06:55.990> of<00:06:56.080> next<00:06:56.200> month<00:06:56.350> i<00:06:56.560> would<00:06:56.770> say<00:06:56.919> it's

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
end of next month i would say it's

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
the launch of the ipad 2 so if you're

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.010 
the launch of the ipad 2 so if you're
saving<00:07:02.770> up<00:07:02.889> your<00:07:03.010> hard-earned<00:07:03.370> cash<00:07:04.020> you'll
