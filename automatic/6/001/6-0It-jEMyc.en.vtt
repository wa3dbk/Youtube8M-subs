00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
recommended say 10 w 50 now here's the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.930 
recommended say 10 w 50 now here's the

kicker one of the guys here in town told
me<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.420> could<00:01:00.629> use<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.379> I've<00:01:01.770> been<00:01:02.039> using

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
me that I could use and I've been using

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.200 
me that I could use and I've been using
already<00:01:02.789> twice<00:01:03.650> this<00:01:04.650> oil<00:01:04.920> over<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
already twice this oil over here this is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.890 
already twice this oil over here this is
a<00:01:06.240> rotella<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.950> diesel<00:01:08.360> engine<00:01:09.360> okay<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
a rotella it's a diesel engine okay so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
a rotella it's a diesel engine okay so
it's<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.500> heavy-duty<00:01:11.340> diesel<00:01:11.610> engines<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's for heavy-duty diesel engines and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
it's for heavy-duty diesel engines and
say<00:01:12.990> 15<00:01:13.560> W<00:01:13.979> 40<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.299> isn't<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> specs<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
say 15 W 40 so it isn't the specs as you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.210 
say 15 W 40 so it isn't the specs as you
remember<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.700> specs<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:19.200> Vegas<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.009> was

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
remember the specs for for Vegas it was

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.820 
remember the specs for for Vegas it was
between<00:01:20.520> 50<00:01:20.880> degrees<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.240> 110<00:01:21.780> degrees<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
between 50 degrees and 110 degrees the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.300 
between 50 degrees and 110 degrees the
specs<00:01:23.159> were<00:01:23.509> 20<00:01:24.509> W<00:01:24.750> 40<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.320> 15<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
specs were 20 W 40 so this is 15 it's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
specs were 20 W 40 so this is 15 it's
even<00:01:26.549> lower<00:01:26.700> therefore<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.829> very

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
even lower therefore it's a it's a very

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
even lower therefore it's a it's a very
very<00:01:29.310> good<00:01:29.430> oil<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> bike<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:31.200> this

it<00:01:51.270> about<00:01:52.220> 350<00:01:53.220> miles<00:01:53.479> versus<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.170> know

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it about 350 miles versus you know

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
it about 350 miles versus you know
before<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.860> doing<00:01:55.979> 500<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.820> pushing

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
before I was doing 500 I was pushing

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.109 
before I was doing 500 I was pushing
because<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.570> 10<00:01:57.840> W<00:01:58.200> 59<00:01:59.159> oil<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.850> about

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
because that 10 W 59 oil is like about

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
because that 10 W 59 oil is like about
nine<00:02:00.360> dollars<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.960> quart<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> could

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
nine dollars a quart this one I could

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.520 
nine dollars a quart this one I could
change<00:02:02.700> four<00:02:02.939> times<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.420> $15<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.290> I'd<00:02:04.409> rather

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
change four times for $15 so I'd rather

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.850 
change four times for $15 so I'd rather
do<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:04.890> other<00:02:05.009> changes<00:02:05.399> more<00:02:05.579> often<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
do my other changes more often and
