strings with my index finger then I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.300 
strings with my index finger then I
leave<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.360> G<00:01:38.690> open<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.410> want<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.770> seven

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
leave the G open you want that seven

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.420 
leave the G open you want that seven
sound<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.820> G<00:01:41.150> is<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.690> seventh<00:01:42.470> dominant

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
sound and G is the seventh dominant

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.570 
sound and G is the seventh dominant
seventh<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.570> then<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.410> close<00:01:46.250> off<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
seventh of a and then I close off the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.910 
seventh of a and then I close off the
last<00:01:46.790> two<00:01:47.000> with<00:01:47.150> my<00:01:47.270> other<00:01:47.420> two<00:01:47.600> fingers

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.580 

but<00:01:54.280> not<00:01:54.520> easy<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.270> play<00:01:55.509> melody<00:01:55.990> notes<00:01:56.200> around

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
but not easy to play melody notes around

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.320 
but not easy to play melody notes around
so<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.070> lot<00:01:57.400> of<00:01:57.520> times<00:01:57.729> I'll

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:12.050 

then<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.290> play<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.680> seven<00:02:07.130> major<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:11.060> little

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
then I can play the seven major a little

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.410 
then I can play the seven major a little
color<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.990> little<00:02:13.230> easier<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.550> my<00:02:14.880> hand<00:02:15.210> is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
color a little easier but my hand is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.020 
color a little easier but my hand is
weak<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:16.110> bar<00:02:16.440> chords<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.580> one<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
weak on bar chords that's one of the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.510 
weak on bar chords that's one of the
reasons<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.420> gave<00:02:18.630> up<00:02:18.780> rock<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.230> roll<00:02:19.380> my<00:02:20.190> thumb
