 With the Overwintering Wizard

 So you can easily get it out 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.870
 Why I want to do it a bit 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 Material is Seoul approach 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.100
 Riza Rib Skull Wither Skeleton No Head 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:42.449
 Date house 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 As is Yes, wintering way even a simple whether the Mako to issue a separate Iron Golem + and 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.020
 Speaking of which 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.100

 The image of the so-called three-necked dragon, or the image of the King Ghidora, so this rib 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.180
 Wither skeleton think 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.710
 Head Sakura 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.620
 What 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.570
 road 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.200
 That's it 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 I entered 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.010
 It will be now 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.070
 It already is a little something cool 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070
 Follow 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.230
 Thunder window explosion 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.510
 Yes 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.380
 This is a wizard 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.380
 It seems like summer 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.120
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.580
 Oh 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.490
 I'll see you I see you 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.710
 It's a move 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.310
 I tried to put it out a bit 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.270
 I can not go on a runaway 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.010
 It is half 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.530
 Western-style movement is a bit 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.700
 I will attack 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.700
 Because it's so creative 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.149
 It is my turn Address 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 I'm attacking with a diamond diamond sword 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.930
 There is no such decrease 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.869
 I wonder whether I was doing when you're in this survival 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.730
 In the matter of diamond 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.730
 Because each is a degree of damage 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.600
 I wonder if write you come I a I'm a pretty tough survival 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.530
 I can not move 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.630
 No 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.290
 What do you kill 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.670
 Is it because you say that there is no attack target 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 I can not give you something a bit Tower 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.970
 I do not know well 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.570
 It doesn't make sense but chicken 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.570
 Fish to say 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.159
 Next is Mr. Bird 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.000
 It's amazing 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.000
 I attack I was doing this and Oh attack target appears 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.890
 of 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.890
 I think you have to recover be is 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.800
 This is not to feel to win at all I'm something beneath 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.810
 Door ho 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.130
 It took a little Well then another chopper 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.560
 This one 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.370
 It seems like this is deliberate 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.920
 Four days 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.280
 'S fly 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.280

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.930
 Crime san 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.930

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.450
 Method 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.810
 The example is difficult 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.830
 I wonder if I come out to Survival think 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.900
 visa 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.170

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.970
 Back of the wizard come out Fu say how and in what boarding 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.160
 I do not know a little bit 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.980
 In the sense say cormorant Heiwado Iuko 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.980
 I hit it with a basic bow, and when I beat it 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.500
 5 well 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.500
 This is a wizard 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.449
 It really it is mon giant nice guy also had 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.070

 Terrible three-necked dragon fish 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.180
 I tried to release 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.770
 Seoul sand to 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.180
 In the skull I think will help 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:47.389
 I can be put out easily, but open Nakuna Hito' 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.600
 What should I do if this is perfect ? 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.330
 Bewildering if 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.280
