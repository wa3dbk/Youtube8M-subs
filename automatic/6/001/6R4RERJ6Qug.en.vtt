a burning lens magnifying glass this is
a<00:00:29.029> burning<00:00:29.480> lens<00:00:30.340> some<00:00:31.340> of<00:00:31.460> them<00:00:31.609> actually<00:00:31.789> had

little copper wire handles on them but

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.740 
little copper wire handles on them but
that's<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:36.079> burnt<00:00:36.320> end<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.970> it's<00:00:38.449> very

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
that's a burnt end and it's very

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.360 
that's a burnt end and it's very
powerful

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.580 

we<00:00:46.910> need<00:00:47.090> char<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.750> char<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:48.199> what<00:00:48.440> would

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
we need char the char is what would

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.619 
we need char the char is what would
catch<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.160> spark<00:00:49.579> there<00:00:50.149> are<00:00:50.329> many<00:00:50.539> a

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
catch that spark there are many a

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.180 
catch that spark there are many a
natural<00:00:53.629> substance<00:00:54.050> out<00:00:54.350> there<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.010> can

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
natural substance out there that you can

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.750 
natural substance out there that you can
get<00:00:55.399> in<00:00:55.699> in<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.210> forest<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.930> make<00:00:57.160> char<00:00:58.160> out<00:00:58.190> of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
get in in the forest to make char out of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.819 
get in in the forest to make char out of
different<00:00:59.360> plant<00:00:59.629> materials<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.440> stuff<00:01:00.649> like

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
different plant materials and stuff like

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.860 
different plant materials and stuff like
that<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:01.640> if<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.850> got<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.239> you're<00:01:02.449> taking<00:01:02.600> a

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
that but if you got it you're taking a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.040 
that but if you got it you're taking a
char<00:01:03.140> cloth<00:01:03.519> which<00:01:04.519> this<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.879> just<00:01:05.050> either

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
char cloth which this is just either

cotton or linen cloth and that char is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.460 
cotton or linen cloth and that char is
what<00:01:09.710> catches<00:01:10.450> won't<00:01:11.450> do<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.720> away<00:01:11.840> from<00:01:12.020> it

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
what catches won't do it away from it

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.630 
what catches won't do it away from it
first<00:01:12.740> but<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.299> spark<00:01:14.690> that<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:14.930> get

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
first but this is the spark that you get

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.550 
first but this is the spark that you get
and<00:01:16.640> seeing<00:01:16.880> they<00:01:17.000> just<00:01:17.240> go<00:01:17.450> everywhere<00:01:17.810> you

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
and seeing they just go everywhere you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.950 
and seeing they just go everywhere you
have<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.890> be<00:01:19.039> able<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.280> catch<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:19.580> spark<00:01:20.270> in

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
have to be able to catch that spark in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.620 
have to be able to catch that spark in
order<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:22.130> make<00:01:22.310> use<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.210> that's<00:01:23.450> what

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
order to make use of it so that's what

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.570 
order to make use of it so that's what
you<00:01:23.780> do<00:01:23.929> with<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.229> char<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.740> char<00:01:25.009> actually

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
you do with the char the char actually

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.370 
you do with the char the char actually
catches<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.119> Bart<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.229> sit<00:01:33.229> up

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
catches this Bart I can get it to sit up

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.600 
catches this Bart I can get it to sit up
there<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:35.360> has<00:01:35.479> been<00:01:35.630> in<00:01:35.780> their<00:01:35.960> foot<00:01:36.610> there

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
there this has been in their foot there

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.990 
there this has been in their foot there
we<00:01:37.789> go<00:01:37.940> see<00:01:38.390> how<00:01:38.539> that<00:01:38.750> piece<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.170> char<00:01:40.000> catches

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
we go see how that piece of char catches

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.290 
we go see how that piece of char catches
that<00:01:41.119> little<00:01:41.509> tiny<00:01:41.720> spark<00:01:42.140> now<00:01:42.909> take<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.149> and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
that little tiny spark now take that and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:57.420 
that little tiny spark now take that and
put<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.659> your<00:01:44.750> birds<00:01:45.020> nests

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.630 

and<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.790> got<00:01:59.000> fired<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.020> quickly

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
and you got fired just that quickly

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.630 
and you got fired just that quickly
important<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.760> have<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.830> fire<00:02:03.830> especially<00:02:04.550> in
