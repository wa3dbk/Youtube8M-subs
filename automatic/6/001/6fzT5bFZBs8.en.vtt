 [Music] 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.320
 h can never anyone that is one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.160
 video today that the match with Marseille 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.670
 avoided a thousand in 2013 detonated and today we go 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 do 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 the mountain village 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.189
 items that Joseph is not lighting and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 the statutes there and this 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 time they do not appear on the map but 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 of this map you are learning here 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.719
 below the screen for navigating the litigation 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 among the items faster beauty 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:46.260
 Come on, the first one. Stay here. I'll go. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 just take that off the map 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.960
 all the other things and show 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 You are the only 22 who are the best 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.239
 extra items ne 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.719
 they do not appear on the map, it's when you 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.340
 take the map with the location of things 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:08.490
 but although there we have to follow 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.300
 straight here and accelerated the first torch 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.570
 joke 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:22.540
 beauty the next she stays here 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:27.640
 near this house and here is the square there 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.280
 It costs more or less here remembering 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.560
 that this idea that I have here has a 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.920
 camp nearby where we 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 starts we go up here and here is the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:52.720
 second statue to light up the Chinese 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:56.560
 next she is right here plus obese 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.100
 neighborhood isaac a little further up 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.100
 truth 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.470
 We will stay here. 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.929
 first with the rope to use the scheme 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.240
 fast Brazilian team in a game not 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.670
 I have it 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:21.830
 we spend only that house quickly 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.830
 here 's another Chinese step 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.950
 the next one we'll mark here she is 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.880
 that end also inside a house 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.730
 there remained straight as tattoo 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.440
 will rise here in this other popular house 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:49.769
 here at the clinic door that 's about to fall 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.030
 and then here without the other statue itself and 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:58.760
 if I think it 's the fastest way 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:01.290
 making the next one between them 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.470
 passing here I'm on that road is 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.420
 come back and she's right here 16 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.190
 way here is a cabin actually goes 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.660
 come back and jump to take care of you 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.610
 You have to reach the edge of your 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:22.250
 team with china will roll under 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:31.380
 this again here only the ropes 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:36.819
 and pass here is what is here 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:41.189
 This passage in a cabin has more 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:47.459
 the talk is beauty was 6 so far, right? 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:51.480
 655 and the next stay here 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.709
 in this rectangle game map language 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:00.959
 popular on this stone 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.959
 in this one by taxi and remember 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.770
 let's go to the next 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:15.400
 but now was a 6 to 7 Here the conductor 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:18.040
 is right here on the map the order I 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.640
 I do and I want to do it on a 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.860
 certain and not a normal sequence 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.850
 do with a wave by a sequence of 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.430
 dates 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.410
 Okay he'll do it he could continue the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.570
 way there but where is bullshit and 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.690
 will pass and civil and faithful if you have not 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.670
 this rope you use an arrow with a 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:47.790
 rope here and boot the rope that what here 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:54.670
 is in a hidden way of being 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:57.130
 different and next to the next board 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.330
 more or less here 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.330
 on this island here 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.790
 Even we 'll use an arrow too. 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.590
 worse for us going down that road 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:20.080
 faster and have to go back and forth 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:28.150
 skip this fight there and amount to more 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:32.110
 one step was 8 the next the next 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.770
 is more or less true fit here O 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.770
 right here 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.850
 We're going back here and now we're going to have 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.760
 and security was to camp in 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:50.470
 a camp here in New York that 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.150
 here on the left eluded have one more 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.160
 stage 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.300
 was the ninth and the next she is coming back 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.280
 here o 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.200
 only it's not exactly the back 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.150
 way is more or less the team 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.010
 From that other island I just want to stay there 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.110
 up and down and until it was 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.310
 It's disgusting that I took more time to find 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.130
 I walk towards her 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.090
 here's the same thing they did cables uses 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.780
 the polita flash put a new cable and 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:29.160
 there was here in this column to track 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:32.910
 home and here she is the chosen one of table 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.150
 completing the fidene nation 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:40.450
 I will have all the statutes on the map and it is 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.530
 That's it, I'm just going to ask one thing 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.990
 You now if you do all this 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.880
 way here I want you to tell me 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.130
 how to come back 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.490
 in the first part to a first row 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.320
 that we left because from here to there alone 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.160
 It has a path here is a path without 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.320
 return 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.150
 I was wondering if there is a way 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.580
 to go back the only way I found it 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.600
 was now marking an abyss to 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.850
 back to another 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.480
 but not if you liked that you a 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:24.449
 limit until the next 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:24.449
