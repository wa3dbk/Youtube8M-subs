00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.610
 when I was younger wrestling 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.300
 occupied at least an hour or so of each 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.009
 my day 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.450
 there was something really exciting 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.399
 in this minestrone of athletes 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.840
 incredibly trained fights 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 choreographic and events capable of 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.440
 rival those of soap operas 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.910
 South American a strange magic that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.950
 pervading every fight came 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.109
 constantly reinforced by characters 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.090
 increasingly bombastic acceptable too 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.550
 in their wanting to be stereotypes at times 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.350
 absurd specks for many years though 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.030
 I don't follow him anymore I stopped by 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.710
 blank point perhaps blocked by 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.199
 pathological absence of protagonists 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.760
 up to the legends of the past o 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.350
 from the simple fact that the federation 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.809
 present a shadow of what was appears 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.219
 once certain athletes are always 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.899
 incredible and every now and then they come out 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.820
 events that succeed in loving the masses 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.409
 of the fans but the spirit of everything 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.300
 a small fire seems to be fading more and more 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.760
 that does not have the courage to revive itself 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.170
 perhaps only in the usual pessimism done 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.549
 is that at least from the point of view 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.979
 videogame a bit I was closer 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.720
 this world also driven by good trials 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.579
 of yoox and the promise of a new one 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.409
 revolutionary title of the david series 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.570
 a of hedgehog key with the support of 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.829
 visual concepts I expected developments 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.689
 completely opposite to those of the 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.130
 show a sensitive evolution that 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.110
 also bring new fans 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.180
 stops of everything 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.490
 here after having gnawed from guide of 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.049
 youcat the team happens to love that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.100
 for the stuffed kingdom, I don't 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.200
 got back 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.820
 on the contrary, we immediately touch the theme more 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 delicate of this derby of the view and no 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.509
 contrary to what you may think 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.820
 it is not the technical sector but rather 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.560
 of the combat system 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.090
 the titles dedicated to the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.190
 wrestling have always ranged between 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 discipline arcade pure closeness 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.970
 real and beer view in particular 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.650
 they always managed to keep a 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.010
 fair balance between these two souls 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.420
 partially ruined by some flaws 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.650
 david abc that the movies had and could 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.660
 be the turning point 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.280
 but this was not the case 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.810
 they were not deny it but 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 in some cases they even represent 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.750
 step back 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.250
 let's start with the most obvious change of 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.840
 pace the speed of the game is 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.340
 significantly decreased and now i 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.050
 fighters move calmly 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.640
 his enviable is the point from 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.480
 appear and slow even during the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.070
 race 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.570
 a permanent stamina bar that 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.010
 lowers with each stroke also leads 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.110
 athletes to move gradually 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.640
 more and more slowly until it almost becomes 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.680
 of the very tired concrete blocks 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.720
 the idea is barely standing up 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.070
 reality is very close but in the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.300
 doing so sacrifices an element 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.000
 indispensable for the games of this 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.500
 like the fun the push towards the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.330
 simulation is not a silly idea about 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.920
 paper yet wrestling is for her 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.810
 nature entertainment and therefore has 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.790
 always guaranteed to developers a 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.769
 certain freedom in the management of 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.540
 speed of recovery of shots in 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.280
 lack of surprises guaranteed by 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.840
 storyline dhabi from here timur 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.790
 maintain a similar rhythm 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.890
 fighting breaks the joy of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.450
 experiences the slowdown is not then 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.280
 not even the worst feature of the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.690
 system because the most serious defect of the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.489
 past for the management of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.930
 countermoves of the series and remained in 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.370
 this way understood 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.110
 we have criticized the counter in many 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.880
 of previous reviews because his 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.010
 response window was based on a 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760
 too many factors and often fin 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.070
 too casual 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
 yet it is always there in touch with every 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.340
 battle that still revolves around 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.230
 it thousand what is further 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.209
 accentuated by the slowness of the strokes that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.070
 facilitates countermoves on kicking fists and 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.600
 manate but confuses ideas even more 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.160
 regarding the projections 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.690
 the only introduction of moving a little 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.280
 all a new gripping system 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.870
 chain that is used a handful of 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.519
 times in the matches that transform certain 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.200
 trade in a kind of mini game the 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.030
 scissor rock paper that requires al 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.350
 player to find a hot spot with 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.180
 the league 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.400
 technology at the end of each step 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.140
 the idea is nice but does not add on its own 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.760
 much loses its freshness already after 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.280
 medicine of clashes and it is not even 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.450
 applicable to certain wrestlers in the case 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.730
 annoys me anyway a 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.840
 delete them in the options 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.250
 in short, in general the rhythm of the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.350
 fights it seemed busted 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.390
 smooth and free of fluidity and speed 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.100
 a real shame because the impacts are 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.230
 improved many new animations in 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.060
 make certain moves very satisfying 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.680
 and management of stamina bars 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.390
 had considerable potential 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.040
 the element which however has all the cards in 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.510
 rule to seriously annoy even 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.220
 his avid fans are the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.390
 contents that have not been cut 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.070
 indifferent 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.810
 remember the historical rivalries seen in 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.760
 previous chapters ok here 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.470
 you will find two the ash tree and you are in 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.170
 part of 2011 is the one between shawn 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.030
 michaels and hhh of the era of ex la 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.070
 structure is similar to the excellent is that it was 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.020
 mode with objectives to complete the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.460
 original but little remains and keeps 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.530
 some matches whose goals are more 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.730
 annoying that fun to this tool 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.830
 what shows that are added almost 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.170
 all the classic big matches including alena 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.510
 sel money in the bank the table match 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.610
 various orphans tell me which investigations 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.170
 rig ripa and hell match without counting 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.460
 the unjustified absence of some of 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.860
 these modalities from meetings with 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.270
 four athletes even the wise publisher 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.220
 hit by the cleaver and this year 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.230
 extremely poor customization 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.610
 of face and body is quite complete but 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.160
 items are scarce options 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.020
 details also forget the 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.030
 possibility of creating belt arenas 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.520
 finishing moves or just the wrestler 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.170
 woman small parenthesis technique after 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.730
 you will find most of the changes 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.620
 having to wait long seconds of 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.230
 completely unjustified loading 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.880
 the wwe universe is back in shape 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.530
 slightly enhanced to satisfy 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.480
 those who wish to move in toto 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.250
 from their favorite federation and dar 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.170
 life to some memorable rivalries the 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.550
 still mode of faults but view 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.350
 the memory of content is very welcome 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.120
 presence as well as welcome arrival 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.400
 of beer giga novelty of dhabi la view 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.740
 it that the kits or my career mode 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.090
 even here we still have to make you 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.620
 Black 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.000
 we are not in front of anything 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.130
 remotely comparable to 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.930
 equivalent in nba we speak of a 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.820
 rather simple linear career that 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.410
 makes you start from the enix does not take you to 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.600
 make the leap in quality smackdown and then 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.340
 harold presents too quickly 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.440
 very few rivalries and events worthy of 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.449
 this name to the story mainly 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.220
 with static messages and does not allow you 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.410
 not even to defend the title once 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.000
 become champions hopefully that will come 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.770
 evolved and made more unpredictable in 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.199
 future because it comes from the great 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.460
 potential however if you are crying 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.510
 for the absence of things to do not 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.880
 desperate 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.280
 the rises will save you the 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.780
 our tone was sarcastic there is a nice one 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.940
 programmone of additions to the showcase 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.710
 one way expected for the future 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.210
 not enough for us to say if the title was 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.669
 in a lot of stuff 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.750
 only the technically it is not 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.460
 game has made enormous progress 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.690
 compared to the backward engine 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.040
 graph of predecessors 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.780
 despite also in this field there 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.669
 are worrying symptoms of a job 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.740
 hurry for example more striking i 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.789
 faces of the wrestlers in the case of those 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.070
 scanned we have a realism 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.169
 impressive but already it is shaped by 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.760
 zero is not up to dinner and orton 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.470
 while in some cases we have results 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.840
 quite far from reality 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.250
 the animations have also improved 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.900
 but they seem to mix some moves 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.970
 redone in full to old movements 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.350
 woody for a rather strange effect 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.300
 which is particularly noticeable when the 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.700
 physics proves to be not perfect 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.349
 although not particularly serious bug 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.570
 we noticed superhuman vibrations 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.520
 of limbs during certain submissions e 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.440
 some other episode of the ramp 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.270
 good finally the sound with a column 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.190
 decent sound even if with few pieces 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.620
 and a discreet commentary in English a 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.270
 upper reaches with the television in 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.250
 poor words the huge expectations for 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.110
 the first bwin extended beer that you don't 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.750
 have been respected 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.100
 katyn is a little wobbly base on 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.630
 which this with the future chapters 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.730
 we hope the technical improvements 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.020
 are exploited by a dry change of 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.020
 direction in the next 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.230
 sanchez 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.720
 the spurs deserve 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.720
 Hello
