00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and interface microphone interface let's

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.720 
and interface microphone interface let's
make<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.590> simple<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.190> say<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.429> had<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
make it simple so say you had a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.200 
make it simple so say you had a
microphone<00:00:12.590> attached<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.799> your<00:00:13.920> mic<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
microphone attached to your mic in and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.630 
microphone attached to your mic in and
you<00:00:15.630> want<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> talk<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.740> real<00:00:16.890> time<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.340> even

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
you want to talk in real time or even

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.769 
you want to talk in real time or even
record<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.779> that's<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> case<00:00:20.539> it's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> really

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
record if that's the case it's a really

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.310 
record if that's the case it's a really
simple<00:00:22.170> way<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:23.130> you're<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.609> is

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
simple way what you're going to do is

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
simple way what you're going to do is
take<00:00:25.320> any<00:00:25.529> empty<00:00:25.830> slot<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> mixer<00:00:26.730> for

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
take any empty slot on the mixer for

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.500 
take any empty slot on the mixer for
example<00:00:27.390> maybe<00:00:27.810> 10<00:00:28.699> let's<00:00:29.699> rename<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.240> for

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
example maybe 10 let's rename it for

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.010 
example maybe 10 let's rename it for
convenience<00:00:31.109> let's<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.619> call<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:33.020> recording

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
convenience let's just call it recording

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.979 
convenience let's just call it recording
so<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.890> call<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> recording<00:00:35.660> over<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.870> on

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so we call the recording over here on

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.500 
so we call the recording over here on
the<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> go

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the in as you can see when I when I go

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 
the in as you can see when I when I go
to<00:00:39.540> none<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> top<00:00:40.530> left<00:00:40.879> over<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.149> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to none at the top left over here it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
to none at the top left over here it's
saying<00:00:42.870> audio<00:00:43.320> input<00:00:43.620> source<00:00:43.920> ask<00:00:44.370> your

already have priority in a different
court<00:01:07.860> recorder<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.939> would<00:01:09.060> show<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
court recorder but what would show up is

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.969 
court recorder but what would show up is
basically<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.140> maybe<00:01:13.140> say<00:01:13.350> sound<00:01:13.619> blaster

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
basically a maybe say sound blaster

basically a maybe say sound blaster
audigy<00:01:14.600> recording<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.869> according<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
audigy recording one according to you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.300 
audigy recording one according to you
click<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.100> thus

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
click on that and then it would thus

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.219 
click on that and then it would thus
connect<00:01:20.700> itself<00:01:21.060> into<00:01:21.450> hit<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> interface

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
connect itself into hit this interface

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
connect itself into hit this interface
then<00:01:22.920> you'd<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.280> talking<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.850> real<00:01:24.060> time<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
then you'd be talking in real time and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
then you'd be talking in real time and
you<00:01:24.659> could<00:01:24.840> apply<00:01:25.110> effects<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:26.580> voice<00:01:26.939> in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
you could apply effects to your voice in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
you could apply effects to your voice in
real<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.829> would<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.130> able<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> open

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
real time and you would be able to open

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.230 
real time and you would be able to open
up<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.630> Edison<00:01:31.020> recorder<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.619> record<00:01:32.009> too<00:01:32.549> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
up the Edison recorder and record too so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.420 
up the Edison recorder and record too so
you<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:33.869> options<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you have those two options there in the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.149 
you have those two options there in the
instance<00:01:35.790> where<00:01:35.939> you're<00:01:36.030> having<00:01:36.329> problems

all in the option settings there's

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.630 
all in the option settings there's
usually<00:01:50.640> two<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.329> inputs<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> look

at<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.119> sometimes<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.290> record

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
at them sometimes this will say record
