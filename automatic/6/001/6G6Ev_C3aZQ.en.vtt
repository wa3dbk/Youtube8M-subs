what I'm talking about

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.860 
what I'm talking about
so<00:04:21.110> now<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:22.220> thing<00:04:22.280> should<00:04:22.880> fit<00:04:23.210> in<00:04:23.360> here<00:04:23.660> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
so now this thing should fit in here the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:38.040 
so now this thing should fit in here the
way<00:04:24.020> it's<00:04:24.400> intended<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:26.000> go<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:26.960> bit<00:04:27.050> step<00:04:27.500> out

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.090

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
problem

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.120 
problem
and<00:04:45.440> my<00:04:46.400> other<00:04:46.610> button<00:04:47.120> has<00:04:48.130> minimal

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
and my other button has minimal

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.580 
and my other button has minimal
clearance<00:04:49.400> but<00:04:50.270> it'll<00:04:50.750> get<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.050> job<00:04:51.289> done

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
clearance but it'll get the job done

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.340 
clearance but it'll get the job done
it's<00:04:52.220> not<00:04:52.520> hurting<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.210> either<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:54.080> fact

it's not hurting it either and in fact

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.310 
it's not hurting it either and in fact
that<00:04:54.889> side<00:04:55.490> acts<00:04:55.820> as<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.000> reinforcer<00:04:56.750> because

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
that side acts as a reinforcer because

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.189 
that side acts as a reinforcer because
I've<00:04:57.440> only<00:04:57.620> got<00:04:57.860> glue<00:04:58.699> on<00:04:58.910> here<00:04:59.180> so<00:04:59.660> that'll

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
I've only got glue on here so that'll

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.200 
I've only got glue on here so that'll
keep<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.470> in<00:05:00.590> place<00:05:00.830> now<00:05:01.130> it's<00:05:01.729> time<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.940> get

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
so I've got the points scraped and if

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.120 
so I've got the points scraped and if
you<00:06:43.700> can<00:06:43.940> look<00:06:44.210> we<00:06:45.020> get<00:06:45.200> a<00:06:45.230> tough<00:06:45.530> angle<00:06:45.770> here

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
you can look we get a tough angle here

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.910 
you can look we get a tough angle here
get<00:06:46.430> closer<00:06:46.870> you<00:06:47.870> can<00:06:48.020> see<00:06:48.260> at<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.440> bottom<00:06:48.590> of

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
get closer you can see at the bottom of

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.000 
get closer you can see at the bottom of
the<00:06:49.010> three<00:06:49.280> those<00:06:49.970> are<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.600> two<00:06:50.780> points<00:06:51.050> and<00:06:51.470> I

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
the three those are the two points and I

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.370 
the three those are the two points and I
know<00:06:52.120> this<00:06:53.120> is<00:06:53.450> probably<00:06:53.720> not<00:06:54.050> the<00:06:54.350> best

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
know this is probably not the best

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.060 
know this is probably not the best
lighting<00:06:55.160> condition<00:06:55.910> I<00:06:56.230> again<00:06:57.230> I<00:06:57.440> apologize

lighting condition I again I apologize

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.180 
lighting condition I again I apologize
but<00:06:59.060> if<00:06:59.540> you<00:06:59.870> look<00:07:00.140> and<00:07:00.530> you<00:07:00.650> have<00:07:00.770> to<00:07:00.920> really

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
but if you look and you have to really

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.090 
but if you look and you have to really
look<00:07:01.520> there<00:07:02.120> is<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.420> point<00:07:03.850> right<00:07:04.990> there<00:07:06.100> that's

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
look there is a point right there that's

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.310 
look there is a point right there that's
your<00:07:07.370> first<00:07:07.610> point<00:07:07.940> and<00:07:08.810> there's<00:07:09.020> another

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
your first point and there's another

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.370 
your first point and there's another
point<00:07:09.740> that's<00:07:10.130> right<00:07:10.700> next<00:07:11.060> to<00:07:11.390> it<00:07:11.570> that's

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
point that's right next to it that's

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.870 
point that's right next to it that's
your<00:07:12.650> jump<00:07:12.950> if<00:07:13.130> you<00:07:13.160> look<00:07:13.400> a<00:07:13.490> left<00:07:13.700> to<00:07:13.850> right

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
your jump if you look a left to right

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.040 
your jump if you look a left to right
and<00:07:14.270> your<00:07:14.390> knife<00:07:14.570> jump<00:07:15.410> and<00:07:15.680> your<00:07:15.830> night<00:07:16.010> so<00:07:16.700> I

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
and your knife jump and your night so I

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.980 
and your knife jump and your night so I
scratch<00:07:18.050> these<00:07:18.290> off<00:07:18.620> to<00:07:18.800> what<00:07:18.920> you<00:07:19.010> can<00:07:19.160> see<00:07:19.400> a

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
scratch these off to what you can see a

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.660 
scratch these off to what you can see a
silver<00:07:20.990> and<00:07:21.500> you<00:07:21.710> probably<00:07:22.010> really<00:07:22.430> can't

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:22.670 
silver and you probably really can't

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.000 
silver and you probably really can't
this<00:07:23.000> doesn't<00:07:23.330> do<00:07:23.420> it<00:07:23.450> justice<00:07:24.110> but<00:07:24.650> the<00:07:24.770> next

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
this doesn't do it justice but the next

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.530 
this doesn't do it justice but the next
thing<00:07:25.130> I'm<00:07:25.340> going<00:07:25.460> to<00:07:25.550> do<00:07:25.670> is<00:07:25.790> try<00:07:26.030> to<00:07:26.060> go<00:07:26.330> ahead

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
thing I'm going to do is try to go ahead

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.370 
thing I'm going to do is try to go ahead
and<00:07:26.630> attach<00:07:26.900> some<00:07:26.930> wire<00:07:27.640> to<00:07:28.640> these<00:07:28.790> points

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
and attach some wire to these points

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.230 
and attach some wire to these points
which<00:07:30.380> is<00:07:31.150> harder<00:07:32.150> than<00:07:32.300> then<00:07:33.640> it<00:07:34.640> may<00:07:34.910> look

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 
which is harder than then it may look

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.720 
which is harder than then it may look
cool<00:07:35.420> or<00:07:35.630> it<00:07:35.840> may<00:07:35.990> seem<00:07:36.400> alright<00:07:37.400> guys<00:07:37.610> so

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
cool or it may seem alright guys so

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.000 
cool or it may seem alright guys so
check<00:07:37.760> it<00:07:38.060> out<00:07:38.150> I<00:07:38.210> finally<00:07:38.690> got<00:07:38.840> the<00:07:39.440> board<00:07:39.740> all

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
check it out I finally got the board all

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.580 
check it out I finally got the board all
soldered<00:07:40.400> up<00:07:40.670> and<00:07:41.090> on<00:07:41.300> the<00:07:41.390> bottom<00:07:41.900> here<00:07:41.930> I've

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.590 
soldered up and on the bottom here I've
