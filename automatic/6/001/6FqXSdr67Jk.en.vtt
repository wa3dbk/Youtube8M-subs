00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.809
 sewing machine irreplaceable savings 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 time manual sewing laborious and tedious 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.340
 sewing machine changes everything she does 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.060
 sewing is quick and easy it makes stitches 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.740
 4 meters long in just one minute it's 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.590
 almost accomplish why so fast 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.010
 thanks to an extraordinary accurate calculation 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.009
 sewing machine pattern synchronicity 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.260
 starting step you are all due to the fact that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.530
 I our two threads at once, she just 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.140
 must be synchronized cyber attacks 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.480
 the sewing machine knows all about time 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 to his sako pour in the car sewing 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 The three main elements of this are used. 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.730
 chapters letting some more 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.930
 gear racks grip tissue and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.750
 promoting and and most important 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.780
 rotary shuttle more important rest assured 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.390
 it has the whole secret of sewing machines 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 to understand why it will be needed 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.720
 disassemble 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.300
 press the pedal and eyes running 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.250
 up-down 14 1 second 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.240
 lay down only partially goes through 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.530
 the cloth 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.079
 player of our itâ€™s thread stuff 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 more precisely, even two threads machine makes 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.310
 seam tying two threads together 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.390
 of them wound on top stretches along 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.679
 typewriter passes through the eye of the needle 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.209
 funny in the eye of the needle is located in her 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.590
 the bottom of that is from the sharp end 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.019
 when the needle goes down through the mother 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.050
 passes only the end of the loop missing 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.720
 through the holes in the needle plate 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.520
 then the needle rushes again on 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.780
 cool record pass another 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.780
 thread reeled on reel 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.980
 but how then does a seam come out if the needle 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.680
 just falls and rises 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.000
 help comes from the bottom there is located 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.150
 special hook or 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.130
 rotary dude when the needle pierces 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.709
 thread loop thread and pushed 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.980
 through the car at that exact moment 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.480
 stocking captures this loop this and 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.480
 called sync 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.380
 the key is simple but beautiful 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.270
 timed motion now 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.020
 the thread in the bottom of the woman can not catch 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.900
 for this loop rising glo pulls on 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.620
 the lower thread binds both threads 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.620
 together 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.470
 you and the seam is ready further to the rack 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.350
 cling matter moving it forward and 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.700
 smoother re- starts on fabric for new 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.380
 stitch just wrong you only 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.300
 imagine at what speed it 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.690
 produces see needle fly with 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.430
 speed of 14 loops per second slightest 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.030
 failure in this sequence entails 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.750
 a break of the Komi instead of sewing in 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.880
 I would not want everything to be 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.930
 agreed movement of the traffic police shuttle and 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.930
 notched young 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.170
 how is it possible with just 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.330
 single motor 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.750
 he leads the movement of the belt which 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.640
 turns the upper drive shaft 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.379
 then the crankshaft he raises lowers 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.080
 igloo 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.069
 other belt timing belt 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.470
 rotates the lower drive shaft with 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.120
 exactly the same speed is exactly the bottom 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.120
 the shaft drives the shuttle shuttle nuts 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.420
 every turn of the motor starts at you 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.730
 figl rotary shuttle lowered 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.250
 makes a full turn the needle lift 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:23.260
 rivers cling to not pulling her forward 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.260
 you are so every season 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.430
 different parts but everything works 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.800
 synchronously from one motor amazingly 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.310
 sewing machine and ours and two threads 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.750
 and 1 downward angle sewing 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.670
 machine make slow and tedious 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.980
 lesson in demonstration agreed 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.670
 action saving right real secret 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.840
 its success a great consistency in 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.840
 field of machine consistency
