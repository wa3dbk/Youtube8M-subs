00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:55.949

00:00:39.980 --> 00:01:59.570
 cafter youth club 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:59.570
 the leave is very tired 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.200
 it's a big symbol dfe never stop 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.879
 all ego swell boxes 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:41.840
 quantum and nichane six team 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:41.840
 made the buzz this text in copenhagen 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.010
 a blue had revealed that christian 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.170
 kabasele this Sunday the game at the top 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.480
 against the prij but first of all I 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.130
 would like to know you have not trained 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.810
 with the new coach for three 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.569
 weeks what do you think 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.260
 we see that he is overtaken by the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.549
 first league 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.349
 is he really British with 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.019
 a lot a lot of small ones 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.239
 how to say little confrontation of 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.889
 small matches with a lot of intensity 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.250
 it's someone who would have been watching 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.620
 a lot and but here also motivated the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.780
 the players we make small 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.380
 matches and all that ok the match of 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.569
 sunday top home game good 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.400
 what do you think about it but I 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.750
 think that one must one must play for 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.489
 the three points as like all 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.280
 matches we have to try to fetch 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.239
 victory if it's possible and I 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.310
 think at home 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.160
 as I say in the past low he 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.440
 must be avoided to lose 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.849
 good points here after we do not know when 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.880
 same hp was happening every game at his 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.139
 truth but you have to start wanting 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.420
 go get the three points that's 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.000
 not obvious from 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.410
 to prepare in relation to bruges on 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.640
 do not know how they will play 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.560
 how will they use the new 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.080
 players but hey if we're good 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.940
 focused on how we play on 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.639
 our way of preparing the match not I 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.520
 think I think a preparation of 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.700
 match it's relative to bruges it will be 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.169
 we will say 90% we our preparation 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.200
 and 10% the opponent what and with the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.389
 support of all the stadium it's going to go I 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.980
 think in matches like this ben 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.720
 if we show the opponent that the 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.710
 public is behind us if the audience 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.229
 can encourage them 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 from the first to the last minute 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.710
 may make the difference
