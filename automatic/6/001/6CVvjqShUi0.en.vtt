00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.310
 hello everyone welcome on my channel 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 I was trying to make you a little 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:18.289
 video presentation for la that's him 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.869
 takes about 35 minutes will try to 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.029
 do this during this little ride I 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.009
 you admit I do not want to do thirty or 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.249
 thirty-five minutes to speak what 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:33.140
 it's not my thing 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:35.250
 so I will try to make it simple and 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.199
 to get to know me afterwards 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 in my videos 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.949
 so my name is kevin g 28 years old 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.230
 seven years that I do bodybuilding 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.890
 I had a pretty early course 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 chaotic 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.550
 I did not take a mass 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 terrible we will say or rather 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.030
 disgusting to be honest i'm going to 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.690
 put a little picture of 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.420
 by here that I became at the cost of 2 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.350
 years so after his own 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.540
 a little more leaning on dietetics 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.170
 workouts and all that follows 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.740
 to have a good sluggish evolution 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.350
 in bodybuilding 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:27.310
 that's where I met a 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:32.080
 natural american athlete john and coach 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:37.210
 raymond water quail so I am are 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.130
 these types of workouts and his diet 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.420
 so his workouts I am I am 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.170
 the ppl 6 so it's a workout 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.229
 push-pull aig 3 3 strength and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.289
 three hypertrophy workouts we 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.810
 you will see a few videos 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.020
 on his workouts so I do not want to 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.789
 go into the details and for the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 diet 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:08.420
 i am the diet ijf ym 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.319
 so there flexible is so it's followed 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.390
 caloric 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.840
 compared to protein macros 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.090
 lipid carbohydrates and fiber so 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.099
 like I 'm leaving by dragging them in 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.049

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.150
 we will make a short video later 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:31.549
 to talk to you in more detail about 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.659
 how to manage this piece as an issue 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:40.549
 I calculate but mackerel and the rest I 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:44.939
 I'm not a coach I'm not a graduate 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:49.290
 in sports bodybuilding and all the 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:52.290
 rest it's mostly to share my 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.430
 passion that takes we will say a lot of 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.219
 time as you can see at 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:05.689
 you in my opinion we eat bodybuilding 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:08.549
 in bodybuilding 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.269
 so it's a sport that does not say 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.269
 bad time bhl 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.110
 so if I make some mistakes that can 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.660
 to arrive I'm not I'm not a 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.990
 professional is far from it is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:36.630
