think I'll straight away is Need for
Speed<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> series<00:00:42.420> we're<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
Speed as a series we're gonna look in it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
Speed as a series we're gonna look in it
as<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> games<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.850> back<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.149> all

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
as if all of the games go back on all

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
as if all of the games go back on all
the<00:00:45.600> games<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.950> styles<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.670> games

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the games and see that styles of games

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
then see which of these may actually be

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
then see which of these may actually be
a<00:00:53.430> thing<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> next<00:00:54.149> Nev<00:00:54.390> speed<00:00:54.629> will<00:00:54.809> kind

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
a thing in the next Nev speed will kind

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
a thing in the next Nev speed will kind
of<00:00:55.020> say<00:00:55.230> well<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.649> probably<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.340> be

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
of say well that's probably not gonna be

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
of say well that's probably not gonna be
it<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.910> might<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> we'll<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> seat

the<00:00:58.350> first<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.070> thought<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.609> look<00:01:00.000> out

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the first one that I thought to look out

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.349 
the first one that I thought to look out
would<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.449> Need<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.050> Speed<00:01:01.410> Shift<00:01:02.300> now<00:01:03.300> if

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
would be Need for Speed Shift now if

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.789 
would be Need for Speed Shift now if
anyway<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.989> say<00:01:04.140> no<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.559> gonna<00:01:04.680> be

anyway we can say no it's not gonna be

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.710 
anyway we can say no it's not gonna be
 because<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.549> me<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.939> speed<00:01:06.119> shift<00:01:06.420> 2

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
 because it's me for speed shift 2

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
 because it's me for speed shift 2
came<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> same<00:01:07.590> year<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.860> hops<00:01:08.040> 2<00:01:08.159> 2010<00:01:08.790> I

came up the same year as hops 2 2010 I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.320 
came up the same year as hops 2 2010 I
believe<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:10.229> those<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:11.189> near<00:01:11.549> struggle

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
believe and all those very near struggle

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.620 
believe and all those very near struggle
to<00:01:12.479> sell<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.930> million<00:01:13.500> copies<00:01:14.210> now<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
to sell a million copies now for a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
to sell a million copies now for a
normal<00:01:16.049> game<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.680> pretty<00:01:17.159> damn<00:01:17.369> good

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
normal game that's pretty damn good

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
normal game that's pretty damn good
that's<00:01:17.909> still<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.420> profit<00:01:19.020> probably<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.680> mean

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that's still a profit probably I mean

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
that's still a profit probably I mean
especially<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> sequel<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.990> massive

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
especially for a sequel of a massive

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
especially for a sequel of a massive
series<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.189> me<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.430> speed<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> still

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
series like me for speed it's still

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.030 
series like me for speed it's still
probably<00:01:24.240> profitable<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> end<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
probably profitable but at the end of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
probably profitable but at the end of
the<00:01:26.100> day<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.670> Need<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.850> Speed<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.540> was

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the day for Need for Speed now was

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.109 
the day for Need for Speed now was
absolute<00:01:28.350> dog<00:01:28.710> shite<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.610> even<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
absolute dog shite because even the

absolute dog shite because even the
lowest<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> low<00:01:30.659> points<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> series

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
lowest of the low points of the series

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.170 
lowest of the low points of the series
got<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> about<00:01:33.210> 6<00:01:33.630> 7<00:01:33.900> million<00:01:34.439> copies<00:01:34.770> sold<00:01:35.280> so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
got to about 6 7 million copies sold so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
got to about 6 7 million copies sold so
I<00:01:36.509> mean<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> million<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> pathetic<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

recently<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.630> think<00:02:13.840> was<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.050> year<00:02:14.320> ago<00:02:14.560> now

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
recently I think was like a year ago now

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.650 
recently I think was like a year ago now
I<00:02:14.770> say<00:02:15.160> recently<00:02:15.400> that's<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.360> seems<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
I say recently that's that seems like a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.450 
I say recently that's that seems like a
long<00:02:16.900> time<00:02:16.930> time<00:02:17.590> speeds<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.100> where<00:02:18.250> she<00:02:18.370> got

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
long time time speeds up where she got

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.070 
long time time speeds up where she got
older<00:02:18.820> all<00:02:18.970> right<00:02:19.150> felt<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.780> played<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
older all right felt like I played a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.750 
older all right felt like I played a
couple<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.500> weeks<00:02:20.620> ago<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.100> anyway<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
couple of weeks ago but anyway to the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.570 
couple of weeks ago but anyway to the
point<00:02:22.000> they<00:02:22.510> leave<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> Speed<00:02:23.140> Pro<00:02:23.320> Street

although<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> good<00:02:25.150> game<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.570> some<00:02:25.780> ways<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.230> was

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
although a good game in some ways it was

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.890 
although a good game in some ways it was
an<00:02:26.500> absolute<00:02:26.980> disaster<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.910> multiple<00:02:28.690> ways

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
an absolute disaster in multiple ways

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
an absolute disaster in multiple ways
including<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.830> handling<00:02:30.400> which<00:02:30.580> was

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
including the handling which was

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.330 
including the handling which was
dreadful<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:32.140> led<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.680> not<00:02:32.920> being<00:02:33.100> one

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
dreadful and it led to it not being one

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.100 
dreadful and it led to it not being one

for Speed to run another low point of
the<00:03:15.910> series<00:03:16.500> possibly<00:03:17.500> due<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.890> fact<00:03:17.980> that

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
the series possibly due to the fact that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.610 
the series possibly due to the fact that
it<00:03:18.430> was<00:03:18.640> just<00:03:18.880> not<00:03:18.940> hot<00:03:19.480> pursuit<00:03:19.930> hoppers<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
it was just not hot pursuit hoppers you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
the living daylights out of it and then

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.900 
the living daylights out of it and then
later<00:03:25.450> on<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.410> run<00:03:26.680> didn't<00:03:27.190> do<00:03:27.280> too<00:03:27.520> well<00:03:27.550> I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
later on the run didn't do too well I

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.430 
later on the run didn't do too well I
mean<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.210> hopper<00:03:28.360> suit<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.720> me<00:03:28.870> wasn't<00:03:29.200> that

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
mean the hopper suit to me wasn't that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.960 
mean the hopper suit to me wasn't that
great<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.830> game<00:03:30.010> which<00:03:30.220> made<00:03:30.430> me<00:03:30.550> not<00:03:30.700> get

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
great of the game which made me not get

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.550 
great of the game which made me not get
the<00:03:31.150> run<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.600> I'm<00:03:31.660> pretty<00:03:31.840> sure<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.110> same<00:03:32.380> for

all<00:03:36.970> over<00:03:37.210> it<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:38.320> was<00:03:38.440> when<00:03:38.590> they

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
all over it and that was when they

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.890 
all over it and that was when they
literally<00:03:39.010> got<00:03:39.220> rid<00:03:39.520> of<00:03:39.550> black<00:03:40.030> box<00:03:40.330> after

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
that so that was a massive disappointing

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.830 
that so that was a massive disappointing
game<00:03:42.730> once<00:03:42.940> again<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.570> think<00:03:43.720> they're

that's<00:03:56.410> what<00:03:56.530> rivals<00:03:57.010> technically<00:03:57.490> was<00:03:57.730> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
that's what rivals technically was it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.130 
that's what rivals technically was it
was<00:03:58.120> kind<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.690> child<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.610> OPSEU<00:04:00.610> 2010<00:04:01.240> so

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
was kind of the child of OPSEU 2010 so

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.140 
was kind of the child of OPSEU 2010 so
if<00:04:02.200> they<00:04:02.350> were<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.620> make<00:04:02.770> another<00:04:03.250> one<00:04:03.520> after

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
if they were to make another one after

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.390 
if they were to make another one after
people<00:04:04.480> complained<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.230> don't<00:04:05.740> want<00:04:05.980> anymore

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
people complained and don't want anymore

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.270 
people complained and don't want anymore
like<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.270> last<00:04:07.540> good<00:04:07.930> games<00:04:08.290> were<00:04:08.680> rivals

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
like the the last good games were rivals

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.030 
like the the last good games were rivals
probably<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.060> hopper<00:04:10.510> since<00:04:10.810> 2010<00:04:11.260> as<00:04:11.740> good

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
probably and hopper since 2010 as good

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.610

want anymore and I rivals I think shows

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.580 
want anymore and I rivals I think shows
that<00:04:17.770> but<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.060> fact<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.690> they<00:04:19.840> delayed<00:04:20.320> in

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
that but the fact that they delayed in

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.500 
that but the fact that they delayed in
the<00:04:20.739> game<00:04:20.919> for<00:04:21.250> another<00:04:21.880> year

the game for another year

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.760 
the game for another year

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
makes sense it's always been the

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.640 
makes sense it's always been the
best-selling<00:05:05.610> area<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.719> series<00:05:07.169> the

they said in multiple multiple things

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.629 
they said in multiple multiple things

people to do with the series and you

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.159 
people to do with the series and you

know get their opinions in that sort of

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.489 
know get their opinions in that sort of
thing<00:05:25.409> and<00:05:25.650> I<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:27.210> just<00:05:27.240> makes<00:05:27.810> sense<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.229> be

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:28.499 
thing and I it just makes sense to be

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.409 
thing and I it just makes sense to be
one<00:05:29.039> of<00:05:29.219> those<00:05:29.460> games<00:05:29.879> it<00:05:30.120> may<00:05:30.240> not

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
one of those games it may not

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.350 
one of those games it may not
necessarily<00:05:30.479> be<00:05:31.169> underground<00:05:32.039> 3<00:05:32.520> in<00:05:32.729> title

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
necessarily be underground 3 in title

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.899 
necessarily be underground 3 in title
but<00:05:34.139> I'm<00:05:34.289> guessing<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:35.039> game<00:05:35.279> itself<00:05:35.669> is

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
but I'm guessing the game itself is

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.909 
but I'm guessing the game itself is
going<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.330> share<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.990> fact<00:05:37.229> that<00:05:37.349> it's<00:05:37.620> gonna

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
going to share the fact that it's gonna

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.219 
going to share the fact that it's gonna
be<00:05:38.240> customization<00:05:39.240> is<00:05:39.449> gonna<00:05:39.689> be<00:05:39.870> illegal

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
be customization is gonna be illegal

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.149 
be customization is gonna be illegal
