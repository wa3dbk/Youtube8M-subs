that's all if the boards do that you can

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
that's all if the boards do that you can
forget<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.100> checkboxes

as they don't dilute it by having a
dozen<00:02:12.660> other<00:02:12.810> things<00:02:13.080> about

fountain<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.180> located<00:02:16.920> well<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.160> part<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
fountain be located well a part of the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.430 
fountain be located well a part of the
problem<00:02:18.730> with<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.690> SEC<00:02:19.959> rules

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
problem with that is that the SEC rules

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.040 
problem with that is that the SEC rules
make<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.099> go<00:02:21.250> through<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.610> sort<00:02:21.819> of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
make you go through the sort of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.120 
make you go through the sort of
serpentine<00:02:23.050> process<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.739> it's<00:02:23.830> hard<00:02:23.980> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
serpentine process and it's hard to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.680 
serpentine process and it's hard to
address<00:02:24.340> them<00:02:24.760> more<00:02:24.880> directly<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.300> hope<00:02:25.480> that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
address them more directly I hope that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.270 
address them more directly I hope that
the<00:02:25.840> financial<00:02:26.050> reform<00:02:26.500> legislation<00:02:26.590> why<00:02:27.160> do

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the financial reform legislation why do

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.830 
the financial reform legislation why do
you<00:02:27.520> think<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.910> think<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.300> can<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.599> don't

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you think but I think you can I don't

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.449 
you think but I think you can I don't
think<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.110> actually<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.950> mean<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
think you actually have to I mean the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.850 
think you actually have to I mean the
proxy<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:30.970> obviously<00:02:31.330> one<00:02:31.600> way<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> think

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
proxy is obviously one way but I think

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.610 
proxy is obviously one way but I think
if<00:02:33.069> there<00:02:33.520> were<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.330> top<00:02:34.569> five<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.260> terms<00:02:35.500> of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
if there were the top five in terms of

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.199 
if there were the top five in terms of
managing<00:02:35.800> money<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.400> they<00:02:36.550> would<00:02:36.790> speak<00:02:37.030> as

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
managing money if they would speak as

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.110 
managing money if they would speak as
one<00:02:37.239> voice<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:38.020> outrageous<00:02:38.709> things<00:02:39.160> through

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
one voice on outrageous things through

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.759 
one voice on outrageous things through
ads<00:02:40.360> are<00:02:40.600> they<00:02:40.750> call<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> press<00:02:41.260> conference<00:02:41.290> I

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
ads are they call a press conference I

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:42.990 
ads are they call a press conference I
mean<00:02:41.920> they<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.160> plenty<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.430> attention<00:02:42.519> as

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
mean they get plenty of attention as

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.309 
mean they get plenty of attention as
long<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.239> they<00:02:43.330> don't<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.720> too<00:02:43.870> often<00:02:44.050> and

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
long as they don't do it too often and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.380 
long as they don't do it too often and
on<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> wrong<00:02:44.680> things<00:02:45.010> right<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.580> if<00:02:46.180> they

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
on the wrong things right and if they

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.390 
on the wrong things right and if they
would<00:02:46.600> they<00:02:47.200> would<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:47.380> come<00:02:47.739> out<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.130> five

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
would they would just come out and five

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.949 
would they would just come out and five
of<00:02:48.580> them<00:02:48.670> would<00:02:48.790> sit<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.150> room<00:02:49.300> representing

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
of them would sit in a room representing

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.660 
of them would sit in a room representing
Emmel<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.380> name<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> names<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.489> know

Emmel you name the names but you know
them<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.330> they<00:02:52.540> would<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.690> say<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.080> is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
them and and they would just say this is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.740 
them and and they would just say this is
outrageous<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.860> why<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:55.480> would<00:02:55.569> change

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
outrageous and why it would change
