00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
is a kind of a cool easter egg that my

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.200 
is a kind of a cool easter egg that my
friend<00:00:21.390> found<00:00:21.710> he<00:00:22.710> spawn<00:00:23.100> near<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.640> gas

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
friend found he spawn near this gas

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.859 
friend found he spawn near this gas
station<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.900> there's<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> gas<00:00:25.920> line

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
station and there's actually a gas line

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
station and there's actually a gas line
uh<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.470> rings<00:00:28.740> every<00:00:29.130> time<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.580> walk<00:00:29.970> over

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
uh and it rings every time you walk over

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.590 
uh and it rings every time you walk over
it<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.720> i<00:00:30.750> guess<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> past<00:00:32.149> like<00:00:33.149> cars

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it so i guess like in the past like cars

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.959 
it so i guess like in the past like cars
would<00:00:33.840> run<00:00:34.050> over<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.700> maybe<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
would run over it and like maybe the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.720 
would run over it and like maybe the
clerk<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.170> somebody<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.550> wash

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
clerk or somebody would go out and wash

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.220 
clerk or somebody would go out and wash
the<00:00:38.940> windows<00:00:39.270> or<00:00:39.420> something<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:39.930> they<00:00:40.050> heard

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
