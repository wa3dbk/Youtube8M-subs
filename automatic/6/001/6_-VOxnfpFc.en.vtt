Murphy<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:19.149> experience<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.350> leading

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

Murphy and that experience of leading
the<00:01:21.850> ballet<00:01:22.090> made<00:01:22.719> me<00:01:22.929> feel<00:01:23.140> free<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.859> more<00:01:23.979> in

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
the ballet made me feel free and more in

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.690 
the ballet made me feel free and more in
my<00:01:24.520> artistry<00:01:24.999> and<00:01:25.359> as<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.020> dancer<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.219> was<00:01:27.460> sort

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
my artistry and as a dancer it was sort

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.419 
my artistry and as a dancer it was sort
of<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:28.030> taste<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.659> what<00:01:29.109> it's<00:01:29.229> like<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.469> be<00:01:30.070> on

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.149 
of a taste of what it's like to be on
top<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:31.450> think<00:01:31.630> that's<00:01:32.200> when<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.409> felt<00:01:32.710> most

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
top and I think that's when I felt most

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.609 
top and I think that's when I felt most
like<00:01:33.429> a<00:01:33.670> mature<00:01:33.819> developed<00:01:34.810> artist<00:01:37.619> my

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
like a mature developed artist my

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.309 
like a mature developed artist my

parents played a huge role in my success
and<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.929> could<00:01:43.929> never<00:01:44.079> have<00:01:44.259> done<00:01:44.319> it<00:01:44.530> without

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
really like for the audience to feel my

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.280 
really like for the audience to feel my
joy<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.840> easy<00:02:28.080> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
joy I think that it's really easy to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.850 
joy I think that it's really easy to
sense<00:02:29.300> whether<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.480> dancer<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.260> enjoying<00:02:31.650> what

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
sense whether a dancer is enjoying what

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.010 
sense whether a dancer is enjoying what
they're<00:02:32.010> doing<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.510> think<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
they're doing or not and I think it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.360 
they're doing or not and I think it
reads<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.770> lot<00:02:35.370> how<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.730> dancer<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.300> feeling<00:02:36.840> in

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
reads a lot how the dancer is feeling in

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.120 
reads a lot how the dancer is feeling in
life<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.790> their<00:02:39.000> own<00:02:39.120> lives<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.440> would

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
life in their own lives and so I would

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.240 
life in their own lives and so I would
say<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.520> pretty<00:02:42.240> happy<00:02:42.630> person<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:43.680> so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
say I'm a pretty happy person and so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.910 
say I'm a pretty happy person and so
therefore<00:02:44.840> that's<00:02:45.840> what<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.200> try<00:02:46.890> to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
therefore that's what I just try to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.030 
therefore that's what I just try to
portray<00:02:47.310> when<00:02:47.580> I'm<00:02:47.700> onstage<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:49.410> hope<00:02:49.860> that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
portray when I'm onstage and I hope that

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.030 
portray when I'm onstage and I hope that
the<00:02:50.160> audience<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.870> relate<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.740> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the audience can relate to me and and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.490 
the audience can relate to me and and
share<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.790> my<00:02:53.970> joy

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
share in my joy

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:04.970 
share in my joy
you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.040
