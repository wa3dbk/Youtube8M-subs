number what it basically does is it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.549 
number what it basically does is it
finds<00:00:47.670> every<00:00:47.850> single<00:00:48.600> application<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.500> your

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
finds every single application on your

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.910 
finds every single application on your

and it deletes the unwanted files the
languages<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.750> those<00:01:04.320> applications<00:01:05.180> let<00:01:06.180> me

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
languages of those applications let me

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
languages of those applications let me
spend<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.750> more<00:01:07.020> every<00:01:07.409> application<00:01:07.890> on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
spend a little more every application on

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.719 
spend a little more every application on
your<00:01:08.280> computer<00:01:08.689> has<00:01:11.479> languages<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:14.640> hard

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
your computer has languages so it's hard

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
ran this application x slimmer but if i

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
ran this application x slimmer but if i
can<00:01:20.220> find<00:01:20.400> application<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.390> quickly<00:01:23.360> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can find application really quickly that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
can find application really quickly that
has<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> bunch<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> languages<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:27.439> nope<00:01:28.439> not

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
has a bunch of languages in it nope not

that<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.360> here<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:31.070> soundtrack<00:01:32.070> pro<00:01:32.460> i

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
that one here we go soundtrack pro i

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
that one here we go soundtrack pro i
just<00:01:34.530> opened<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> info<00:01:35.400> tab<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:36.030> by

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
just opened up the info tab here by

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
just opened up the info tab here by
hitting<00:01:36.450> command<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.549> at<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.880> bottom<00:01:39.030> if

you<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:40.140> down<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> language

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
you look down here you have the language

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
you look down here you have the language
is<00:01:41.579> 10<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.420> underneath<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is 10 and underneath it there are a

is 10 and underneath it there are a
bunch<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> languages<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:45.240> honestly<00:01:45.869> add<00:01:46.259> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bunch of languages that honestly add up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
bunch of languages that honestly add up
to<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.939> space<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.509> hard<00:01:48.630> drive<00:01:49.100> if

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to a lot of space on your hard drive if

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
to a lot of space on your hard drive if
you<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.610> lot<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> applications<00:01:51.360> i<00:01:51.659> have

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you have a lot of applications i have

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.340 
you have a lot of applications i have
over<00:01:51.990> 300<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.880> takes<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.079> giggling

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
over 300 and it takes up like giggling

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.980 
over 300 and it takes up like giggling
you<00:01:55.560> could<00:01:55.710> stuff<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.329> languages

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you could stuff so not just languages

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
you could stuff so not just languages
there's<00:01:58.229> also<00:01:58.469> other<00:01:58.740> codes<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.520> i<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.909> not

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
there's also other codes that i will not

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.440 
there's also other codes that i will not
get<00:02:00.210> into<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.049> complicated<00:02:02.299> just<00:02:03.299> what

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
get into that it's complicated just what

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.990 
get into that it's complicated just what
X<00:02:03.630> number<00:02:03.750> does<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.049> gets<00:02:04.680> rid<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.399> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
X number does it gets rid of them and it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
X number does it gets rid of them and it
makes<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.360> applications<00:02:06.899> faster<00:02:07.049> frees<00:02:08.009> up

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
makes your applications faster frees up

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.410 
makes your applications faster frees up
your<00:02:08.220> RAM<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.660> frees<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.379> your<00:02:10.410> hard<00:02:10.679> drive<00:02:11.420> so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
your RAM and frees up your hard drive so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.940 
your RAM and frees up your hard drive so
here<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.260> go<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
here we go this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.550 
here we go this

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
how to use X slimmer what you can do is
