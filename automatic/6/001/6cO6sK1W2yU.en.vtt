yo<00:00:06.870> everyone<00:00:07.200> few<00:00:08.160> weeks<00:00:08.309> ago<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.820> was<00:00:08.940> asked<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
yo everyone few weeks ago I was asked to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
yo everyone few weeks ago I was asked to
do<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> video<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.500> how<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.860> make<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.940> front

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
do a video on how to make the front

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.169 
do a video on how to make the front
wheel<00:00:12.450> steer<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.380> tight<00:00:13.620> wheel<00:00:14.099> arch<00:00:14.370> so

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
wheel steer in a tight wheel arch so

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.800 
wheel steer in a tight wheel arch so
here<00:00:15.480> are<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.900> few<00:00:16.710> examples<00:00:17.039> first<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
here are the few examples first the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.830 
here are the few examples first the
yellow<00:00:18.960> example<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.910> usual<00:00:21.390> example

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
yellow example here is the usual example

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
yellow example here is the usual example
Lego<00:00:22.020> uses<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.279> wheel<00:00:23.430> point<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.210> see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
Lego uses the wheel point as you can see

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.710 
Lego uses the wheel point as you can see
is<00:00:24.810> far<00:00:25.140> outside<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.269> you<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.689> of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is far outside and you need a lot of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.479 
is far outside and you need a lot of
space<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.650> turn<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> wheel<00:00:33.860> now<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.219> next

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
space to turn the wheel now the next

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
space to turn the wheel now the next
example<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> steering

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
example as you can see the steering

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.440 
example as you can see the steering
point<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> start<00:00:38.610> deeper<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> wheel

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
point is a start deeper in the wheel

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.100 
point is a start deeper in the wheel
which<00:00:40.170> means<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.430> solution<00:00:42.149> needs<00:00:42.780> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
which means that this solution needs a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:59.250 
which means that this solution needs a
bit<00:00:43.559> less<00:00:43.800> space<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.760> winter<00:00:45.120> today

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.520 

if<00:00:59.770> we<00:01:00.010> for<00:01:00.460> example<00:01:00.809> compare<00:01:01.809> this<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.410> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
if we for example compare this to the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.040 
if we for example compare this to the
older<00:01:02.920> solution<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.360> see<00:01:04.510> that<00:01:04.690> we<00:01:04.839> gain

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
older solution you can see that we gain

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.280 
older solution you can see that we gain
a<00:01:05.260> start<00:01:05.680> on<00:01:05.950> each<00:01:06.250> side<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.180> arc<00:01:07.479> now<00:01:08.229> you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
a start on each side of the arc now you

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.160 
a start on each side of the arc now you
can<00:01:08.530> also<00:01:08.680> use<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.880> usual<00:01:10.060> Lego<00:01:10.630> suspension

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
can also use the usual Lego suspension

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.070 
can also use the usual Lego suspension
parts<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.790> older<00:01:13.119> variant<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.750> can<00:01:13.930> see

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
parts is the older variant you can see

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.950 
parts is the older variant you can see
here<00:01:14.409> but<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:15.400> variant<00:01:15.880> has<00:01:16.180> limited

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
here but this variant has limited

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.650 
here but this variant has limited
steering<00:01:17.890> angle<00:01:18.220> which<00:01:18.820> means<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.330> you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
steering angle which means that you

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.859 
steering angle which means that you
cannot<00:01:19.960> still<00:01:20.259> pass<00:01:20.560> around<00:01:20.800> 25<00:01:21.640> degrees<00:01:21.869> if

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
cannot still pass around 25 degrees if

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.730 
cannot still pass around 25 degrees if
you<00:01:23.350> want<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.650> steer<00:01:23.890> more<00:01:24.160> than<00:01:24.700> 25<00:01:25.210> degrees

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you want to steer more than 25 degrees

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520 
you want to steer more than 25 degrees

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
Allegro release newer version just for

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.310 
Allegro release newer version just for
this<00:01:29.860> example<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:31.000> was<00:01:31.240> introduced<00:01:31.810> in<00:01:32.140> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
this example it was introduced in the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.490 
this example it was introduced in the
South<00:01:32.649> Latin<00:01:33.220> model<00:01:33.789> and<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.110> see<00:01:35.320> you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
South Latin model and you can see you

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.980 
South Latin model and you can see you
can<00:01:35.710> get<00:01:35.830> much<00:01:36.310> higher<00:01:36.340> searing<00:01:37.330> radius<00:01:37.750> out

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
can get much higher searing radius out

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.650 
can get much higher searing radius out
of<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.350> newer<00:01:38.530> part<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.240> also<00:01:40.390> need

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
of the newer part but you also need

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:58.050 
of the newer part but you also need
quite<00:01:41.229> some<00:01:41.500> room<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:42.180> taking<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.280> for<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
quite some room for taking and for the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.920 
quite some room for taking and for the
last<00:01:58.360> and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
last and

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.920 
last and
it's<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.680> better<00:02:01.890> solutions<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's one of the better solutions this is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
it's one of the better solutions this is
a<00:02:04.490> special<00:02:05.490> mechanism<00:02:06.049> which<00:02:07.049> actually<00:02:07.650> while

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
a special mechanism which actually while

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.059 
a special mechanism which actually while
the<00:02:08.489> wheel<00:02:08.700> steers<00:02:09.170> also<00:02:10.170> shifts<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the wheel steers also shifts the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.580 
the wheel steers also shifts the
steering<00:02:11.459> point<00:02:11.780> forwards<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.900> backwards

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
steering point forwards and backwards

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.309 
steering point forwards and backwards
while<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.250> my<00:02:14.610> original<00:02:15.150> idea<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:16.260> is

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
while this is not my original idea it is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.010 
while this is not my original idea it is
a<00:02:16.680> very<00:02:16.890> useful<00:02:17.100> idea<00:02:17.640> nonetheless<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.450> as

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
a very useful idea nonetheless and as

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.920 
a very useful idea nonetheless and as
you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:20.220> wheel<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.640> steer<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.750> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you can see the wheel can steer in a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.800 
you can see the wheel can steer in a
very<00:02:22.140> tight<00:02:22.410> spot<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.060> particular<00:02:24.390> case

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
very tight spot in this particular case

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.559 
very tight spot in this particular case
there<00:02:25.290> could<00:02:25.470> be<00:02:25.530> some<00:02:25.890> improvements<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:26.790> I

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
there could be some improvements but I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.210 
there could be some improvements but I
think<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.110> general<00:02:28.410> idea

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
think you get the general idea

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.090 
think you get the general idea
the<00:02:29.520> last<00:02:30.270> solution<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.770> with<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the last solution the one with the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.180 
the last solution the one with the
multiple<00:02:32.550> linkages<00:02:33.000> allows<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.530> steer<00:02:35.069> in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
multiple linkages allows you to steer in

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.830 
multiple linkages allows you to steer in
a<00:02:35.280> much<00:02:35.459> tighter<00:02:35.700> space<00:02:36.150> than<00:02:36.540> other

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
a much tighter space than other

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020 
a much tighter space than other
solutions<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.459> does<00:02:38.580> make<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
solutions but it does make the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.960 
solutions but it does make the
suspension<00:02:39.930> system<00:02:40.110> quite<00:02:40.620> complicated<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.670> I

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
suspension system quite complicated so I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.900 
suspension system quite complicated so I
will<00:02:42.269> suggest<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> use<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:44.550> middle

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
will suggest you to use the the middle

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.229 
will suggest you to use the the middle
variant<00:02:45.690> which<00:02:45.959> was<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:47.130> from<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.030> snow

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
variant which was the one from the snow

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.199 
variant which was the one from the snow
ski<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.319> older<00:02:49.920> models<00:02:50.280> which<00:02:50.760> allows<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
ski or the older models which allows you
