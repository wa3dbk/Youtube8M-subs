00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.670
 Hey guys 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 how many times have we come across 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:24.090
 rains and they have something that always 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 save our windshield wiper not 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.719
 only during the rain or often you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.640
 leaves the car where there is a lot of dust or 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:39.899
 leave the car at the edge of the beach where 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:46.559
 saltpeter to penetrate into your 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.159
 windscreen often due to this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 certain water reservoir can see that 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:59.159
 he is a really dirty one and because he 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.390
 took this dirt there is a 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 specific directive to be placed 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.660
 our water reservoir and many 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 Sometimes we do not care to put it but it's 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.730
 very important 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.070
 you have to keep an eye on 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.280
 palettes because she often wears 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.670
 and generate various disorders such as 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.670
 example scratches yours for breeze 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:40.710
 plus real to breeze during the rain 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.880
 if that rubber that does not have you good 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.640
 will have a serious problem of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.860
 visibility can cause an accident 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.350
 and I'm with the engine in my hands 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 retired for us is giving maintenance 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.740
 do a cleanup because there really is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.100
 that we end up leaving hands is 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 really something that does not give easy problem 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.050
 but it's good that you 're always giving 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.599
 check these sealing rubbers 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.280
 which often in the case of the noise 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.500
 Are you sure you're doing it in the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.100
 in front of us it does not bother us anymore 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.570
 is to vote on the goal is that this song is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.140
 be all right 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:33.320
 also take to clean it works 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 with I'm going to give here in the case with diesel oil 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:42.990
 or quietly clean that part and the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:45.740
 lubricated in the axles also in the 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.740
 control shaft 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.690
 we have a motor 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.100
 it is responsible for generating such 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.260
 movement hardly gives problem 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.800
 trouble getting engine finds it easy 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.800
 to buy
