but<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.210> first<00:00:20.690> key<00:00:20.960> to<00:00:20.990> making<00:00:21.650> sure<00:00:21.710> that

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
but the first key to making sure that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.290 
but the first key to making sure that
they<00:00:22.130> live<00:00:22.310> beautifully<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.000> happily

they live beautifully and happily
together<00:00:23.600> is<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.410> get<00:00:24.560> quite<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:24.830> few<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:25.190> them

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
together is to get quite a few of them

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.780 
together is to get quite a few of them
because<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.870> numbers<00:00:27.770> will<00:00:28.010> disperse<00:00:28.550> the

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
because the numbers will disperse the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.180 
because the numbers will disperse the
aggression<00:00:29.270> and<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.650> other<00:00:30.650> thing<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.010> make

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
aggression and the other thing is make

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.650 
aggression and the other thing is make
sure<00:00:31.220> that<00:00:31.400> they're<00:00:31.670> all<00:00:31.700> put<00:00:32.059> in<00:00:32.180> around<00:00:32.480> the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
sure that they're all put in around the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.650 
sure that they're all put in around the
same<00:00:32.689> time<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.100> we've<00:00:34.760> just<00:00:34.790> recently<00:00:35.240> done

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
same time so we've just recently done

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.170 
same time so we've just recently done
this<00:00:35.840> tank<00:00:36.170> up<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.650> we've<00:00:37.310> added<00:00:37.550> these<00:00:37.820> fish

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
this tank up and we've added these fish

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.030 
this tank up and we've added these fish
the<00:00:38.750> other<00:00:38.900> thing<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.290> we've<00:00:39.680> added<00:00:39.829> them

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
the other thing is that we've added them

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.360 
the other thing is that we've added them
all<00:00:40.160> small<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.140> larger<00:00:42.710> they<00:00:42.860> are<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
all small so the larger they are and the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.479 
all small so the larger they are and the
longer<00:00:43.730> they<00:00:43.850> have<00:00:43.880> to<00:00:44.920> stake<00:00:45.920> their<00:00:46.190> claim

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
longer they have to stake their claim

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.520 
longer they have to stake their claim
and<00:00:46.520> start<00:00:46.970> to<00:00:47.150> beat<00:00:47.810> dominance<00:00:48.320> in<00:00:48.440> the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
and start to beat dominance in the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.150 
and start to beat dominance in the
aquarium

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
aquarium

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.479 
aquarium
the<00:00:49.520> harder<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.450> add<00:00:50.630> more<00:00:51.370> of<00:00:52.370> a

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
the harder it is to add more of a

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.860 
the harder it is to add more of a
similar<00:00:52.940> species<00:00:53.590> so<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:54.649> can<00:00:55.070> mix<00:00:55.450> all<00:00:56.450> these

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
similar species so you can mix all these

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.950 
similar species so you can mix all these
sorts<00:00:57.200> of<00:00:57.290> fish<00:00:57.880> just<00:00:58.880> unfortunately<00:00:59.540> it

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
sorts of fish just unfortunately it

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.209 
sorts of fish just unfortunately it
doesn't<00:01:00.140> always<00:01:00.350> work<00:01:02.500> because<00:01:03.500> I'm<00:01:03.739> they<00:01:04.159> do

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
doesn't always work because I'm they do

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.620 
doesn't always work because I'm they do
have<00:01:04.579> their<00:01:04.759> own<00:01:06.069> set<00:01:07.069> of<00:01:07.359> personalities<00:01:08.359> and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
have their own set of personalities and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.319 
have their own set of personalities and
it's<00:01:09.409> not<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:09.799> every<00:01:10.189> black<00:01:10.429> tang<00:01:10.729> responds

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
it's not like every black tang responds

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.959 
it's not like every black tang responds
the<00:01:11.509> same<00:01:11.749> or<00:01:12.350> every<00:01:12.889> yellow<00:01:13.100> tang<00:01:13.460> responds

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
the same or every yellow tang responds

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.660 
the same or every yellow tang responds
the<00:01:14.090> same<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:15.170> there's<00:01:15.380> always<00:01:15.649> an<00:01:16.159> element<00:01:16.429> of

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the same so there's always an element of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.510 
the same so there's always an element of
luck<00:01:17.109> when<00:01:18.109> mixing<00:01:18.560> these<00:01:18.740> sorts<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.159> fish<00:01:19.369> at

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
luck when mixing these sorts of fish at

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.709 
luck when mixing these sorts of fish at
the<00:01:19.639> moment<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:19.999> can<00:01:20.149> see<00:01:20.179> a<00:01:20.329> lot<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.539> their

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
the moment you can see a lot of their

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.989 
the moment you can see a lot of their
fins<00:01:21.020> are<00:01:21.229> quite<00:01:21.409> tattered<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.340> that's

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
fins are quite tattered and that's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.800 
fins are quite tattered and that's
pretty<00:01:23.270> normal

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
pretty normal

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.129 
pretty normal
they'll<00:01:24.649> heal<00:01:24.950> pretty<00:01:25.219> quickly<00:01:25.929> once<00:01:26.929> they

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:27.139 
they'll heal pretty quickly once they

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:32.190 
they'll heal pretty quickly once they
all<00:01:27.259> sort<00:01:27.649> out<00:01:27.799> their<00:01:28.270> dominant<00:01:29.270> hierarchy

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.230 

but<00:01:33.200> once<00:01:33.380> they<00:01:33.499> all<00:01:33.619> know<00:01:33.799> their<00:01:33.920> place

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
but once they all know their place

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.599 
but once they all know their place
they'll<00:01:35.240> all<00:01:35.420> start<00:01:35.689> to<00:01:36.100> heal<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.399> look

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
they'll all start to heal and look

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.059 
they'll all start to heal and look
beautiful

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069
