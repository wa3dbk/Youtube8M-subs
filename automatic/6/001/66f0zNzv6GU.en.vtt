00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.289
 the leaf bile 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.599
 Hello I warmly welcome you to our today's broadcast Opportunities and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.579
 Possibilities of the new physics 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.310
 What is that new physics? 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.589
 is this a new science 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.259
 the outdated textbooks have finally been rewritten 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.710
 or is the new physicist a new philosophy 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 and something has in common physics and philosophy 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.320
 the classical physicists certainly deal with the construction of dead matter and the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.330
 Philosophers are in search of the meaning of life 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.730
 Meanwhile, the philosophical search for the meaning of being meets 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.449
 on only old Haye traditions and both are called new by the country for 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:45.820
 sparkling wine 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.360
 fed with facts and backgrounds 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 No other science has been defiantly revolutionary in recent years 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.430
 Circulation driven 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.800
 like the physics 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.620
 Albert Einstein was above all else 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.700
 because the old physical world picture is relativized 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.010
 and thus the physics 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 breathed new life 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.230
 Einstein's earth 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.390
 then new branches of research such as quantum physics formed the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.300
 Materials committed energy describes 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.890
 or biophysics 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.250
 another branch of the ninth victory 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 that found out among other things 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.850
 the target of the living organism is an energetic field occupied by organic Fortunen 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.770
 consists 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.930
 In the meantime the new physics is already as far as the secret to phenomena like 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.890
 for example, to explain spiritual Haye boys 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.380
 and understandable for everyone 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 Unfortunately, our previous science responds to discoveries such as 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 An example that happily pleases biophotonics 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
 the discoverer of the Bio Trust Professor Albert Pop even watches his 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.870
 professorship 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.890
 and was defamed for decades 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 and cut by his colleague 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.060
 my name is he Leifheit and I am especially looking forward to mine 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.460
 today's guests because we have them 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.870
 some courageous scientists and professionals 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.510
 with the money the countless opportunities and opportunities of the new physics know 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.540
 want to learn 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.980
 I warmly welcome Markus Nike 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.640
 Sun looks like Arcandor 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.979
 he is so one of professional groups farmers 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.819
 not in the concrete but in the figurative sense 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.459
 because his work connects the spiritual world view of the Vedic 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.240
 become 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.239
 with the findings of modern science 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.889
 i nod has studied physics and philosophy and spent several 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:26.189
 Study visits to India and attending Haridwar University 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.579
 New courses of study developed besides is the author of different books and 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.719
 a very special focus of his work is the so-called life counts 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.809
 the team material body 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.389
 with the spiritual she connects 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.309
 then I warmly welcome Alexander Glock Hannover 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.300
 He actually comes from the financial industry 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.780
 and is now working for the Swiss company Frostpack under 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.080
 The biophysical findings are used to produce other products 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.080
 can reverse the negative effects of electrosmog 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:03.009
 I also warmly welcome Splitter Store Janowitz bad word 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.769
 Hello 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.869
 he is a retailer by profession 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.279
 and co-founder of taz lets that is i whose goal is information 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:15.619
 and documents to life who and act together Nikola Tesla and one 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.499
 interested public 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.769
 then I welcome 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.739
 Privatdozent and Doctor Hendrik loyalty well he studied human medicine in 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.999
 Innsbruck and Heike Bergt under 20 years chief physician and has for Luka 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.949
 Son 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.449
 He is also President of the German Society for Energy 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.979
 and informational medicine 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.139
 no matter how you know him 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.679
 then we warmly 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.890
 Hal Klaus Tod Uhr He is a physicist and professor 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.239
 without gear 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.669
 he wrote his diploma thesis about experimental nuclear physics afterwards 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.080
 he turned to remote solid state physics 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.179
 Hello Mr. 2 2 Raschke 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.179
 but the Tour 2 explores the guard and energy today 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.379
 Alexander Mitscherlich once said 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.580
 Dirk Lauber in science has a lot of Marcus 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.559
 Chen and then the system is done 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.229
 In this context one can also insert something that once with the 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.989
 Nobel Prize was chosen 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.559
 can hardly be removed from the textbooks 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:24.959
 even though it has actually been for decades of scientific reality 

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.209
 never been regretted
