00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
what I think about each brush so here we

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.679 
what I think about each brush so here we
go<00:00:19.830> let<00:00:20.039> me<00:00:20.070> show<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.460> quick<00:00:20.699> overview<00:00:20.850> that

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
I was having the most trouble finding a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.250 
I was having the most trouble finding a
used<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.920> I'll<00:03:04.519> say<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.870> know<00:03:05.989> they<00:03:06.200> were

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
used for I'll say you know they were

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.539 
used for I'll say you know they were
saying<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.950> use<00:03:07.159> it<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:09.739> know<00:03:09.799> defining

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
but it is just too small for me to

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.399 
but it is just too small for me to
define<00:03:13.459> with<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.900> know<00:03:14.930> I'm<00:03:15.140> not<00:03:15.200> going

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
to use that in my hairline or my

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.670 
to use that in my hairline or my
cheekbone<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.810> don't<00:03:18.109> have<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.440> lot<00:03:18.650> of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
cheekbone like I don't have a lot of

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.610 
cheekbone like I don't have a lot of
definition<00:03:19.489> right<00:03:19.639> there<00:03:19.819> anyways<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:21.440> was

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
definition right there anyways and I was

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.349 
definition right there anyways and I was
having<00:03:21.859> kind<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.069> a<00:03:22.160> hard<00:03:22.190> time<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:23.329> know

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
having kind of a hard time you know

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.059 
having kind of a hard time you know
finding<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.780> use<00:03:23.900> for<00:03:24.049> this<00:03:24.169> it's<00:03:24.590> nice<00:03:24.859> for

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
finding a use for this it's nice for

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.059 
finding a use for this it's nice for
blending<00:03:25.669> it's<00:03:26.389> great<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:27.169> buffing<00:03:27.950> and

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
blending it's great for buffing and

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.210 
blending it's great for buffing and
concealer<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.389> edges<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.470> altogether<00:03:30.769> I

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
concealer in the edges but altogether I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.610 
concealer in the edges but altogether I
think<00:03:31.549> this<00:03:31.639> is<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.849> weakest<00:03:32.389> brush<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:33.049> all

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
think this is the weakest brush of all

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.430 
think this is the weakest brush of all
eight<00:03:33.889> is<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:35.079> P<00:03:36.079> 84<00:03:37.870> finally<00:03:38.870> I've<00:03:38.989> got<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.260> P

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
eight is the P 84 finally I've got the P

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.680 
eight is the P 84 finally I've got the P
86<00:03:39.919> which<00:03:40.129> is<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> precision<00:03:40.790> tapered<00:03:41.480> when<00:03:41.660> I

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
86 which is the precision tapered when I

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.240 
86 which is the precision tapered when I
first<00:03:41.900> got<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.319> thought<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.650> would<00:03:42.949> probably

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
first got it I thought it would probably

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.309 
first got it I thought it would probably
be<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.639> one<00:03:43.669> that<00:03:43.879> I<00:03:43.940> used<00:03:44.150> least<00:03:44.419> but<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.139> is

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
be the one that I used least but it is

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.650 
be the one that I used least but it is
really<00:03:45.829> nice<00:03:46.040> for<00:03:46.489> getting<00:03:46.819> in<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.269> buffing

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
really nice for getting in and buffing

Russia's<00:04:26.530> so<00:04:27.220> but<00:04:28.000> here's<00:04:28.210> what<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.390> think

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
Russia's so but here's what I think

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.390 
Russia's so but here's what I think
about<00:04:28.660> these<00:04:28.900> they're<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.500> dense<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.160> compact

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
about these they're so dense and compact

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.950 
about these they're so dense and compact
and<00:04:31.320> they<00:04:32.320> really<00:04:33.030> they're<00:04:34.030> fabulous<00:04:34.510> brushes

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
and they really they're fabulous brushes

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.420 
and they really they're fabulous brushes
so<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.130> way<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.310> use<00:04:36.790> them<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.300> use<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:38.020> f<00:04:38.680> 82

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
so the way I use them I use this f 82

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.300 
so the way I use them I use this f 82
well<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:39.970> guess<00:04:40.180> I'll<00:04:40.330> go<00:04:40.450> in<00:04:40.570> order<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.440> f80<00:04:41.980> is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
well I guess I'll go in order the f80 is

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.500 
well I guess I'll go in order the f80 is
the<00:04:42.550> one<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:42.730> actually<00:04:42.940> had<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.450> one

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
the one I actually had this one

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.540 
the one I actually had this one
previously<00:04:44.110> in<00:04:44.380> that<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.920> loved<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.310> so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
previously in that and I loved it so

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.580 
previously in that and I loved it so
much<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.510> decided<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:47.020> buy<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.140> whole<00:04:47.380> kit

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
much that I decided to buy the whole kit

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.820 
much that I decided to buy the whole kit
so<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.160> have<00:04:48.340> two<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.670> these<00:04:48.760> in<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.990> past<00:04:50.260> I<00:04:50.650> had

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
so I have two of these in the past I had

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.140 
so I have two of these in the past I had
used<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.460> for<00:04:52.000> foundation<00:04:52.930> application

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
used this for foundation application

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.800 
used this for foundation application
essentially<00:04:55.150> what<00:04:55.240> i<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.450> do<00:04:55.570> is<00:04:55.660> i<00:04:55.780> would

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
essentially what i would do is i would

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.810 
essentially what i would do is i would
dot<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.320> on<00:04:56.440> or<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.770> would<00:04:56.950> use<00:04:57.160> just<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.610> regular

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
dot it on or I would use just a regular

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.600 
dot it on or I would use just a regular
brush<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:58.990> dot<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.740> on<00:04:59.860> all<00:05:00.130> over<00:05:00.160> maybe

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
brush and dot it on all over maybe

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.580 
brush and dot it on all over maybe
working<00:05:00.910> in<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> little<00:05:01.420> bit<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.750> then<00:05:01.810> buff<00:05:02.470> it

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
working in a little bit and then buff it

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.830 
working in a little bit and then buff it
in<00:05:02.740> with<00:05:02.950> this<00:05:03.160> but<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.730> found<00:05:04.120> now<00:05:04.480> that<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.690> have

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
in with this but I found now that I have

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.930 
in with this but I found now that I have
the<00:05:04.960> full<00:05:05.170> kit<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.280> flat<00:05:06.520> top<00:05:06.880> brush

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
the full kit that the flat top brush

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.150 
the full kit that the flat top brush
while<00:05:07.690> it's<00:05:08.020> still<00:05:08.200> great<00:05:08.410> for<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.650> the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
while it's still great for that the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.890 
while it's still great for that the
round<00:05:09.370> top<00:05:09.610> brush<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:10.120> actually<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.480> little<00:05:10.720> bit

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
round top brush is actually a little bit

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.590 
round top brush is actually a little bit
better<00:05:11.050> at<00:05:11.350> buffing<00:05:11.740> in<00:05:11.860> foundation<00:05:12.700> so<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.300> use

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
better at buffing in foundation so I use

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.020 
better at buffing in foundation so I use
the<00:05:13.780> f<00:05:13.900> 82<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.770> buffin<00:05:15.070> foundation<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:15.850> I<00:05:15.910> go

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
the f 82 to buffin foundation and I go

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.780 
the f 82 to buffin foundation and I go
back<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.480> f80<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.260> set<00:05:17.800> with<00:05:18.130> powder<00:05:18.430> and

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
back to the f80 to set with powder and

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.180 
back to the f80 to set with powder and
that's<00:05:19.510> really<00:05:20.080> what<00:05:20.470> i<00:05:20.530> use<00:05:20.830> these<00:05:21.040> two

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
that's really what i use these two

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.180 
that's really what i use these two
brushes<00:05:21.460> for<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:23.620> know<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.800> don't<00:05:24.010> want<00:05:24.160> to

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
brushes for you know you don't want to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.180 
brushes for you know you don't want to
really<00:05:24.340> dip<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.730> wet<00:05:25.030> brush<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.570> your<00:05:25.660> powder

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
really dip a wet brush and your powder

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.190 
really dip a wet brush and your powder
so<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.220> find<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:27.940> it's<00:05:28.120> kind<00:05:28.450> of<00:05:28.600> necessary<00:05:28.780> to

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
so I find that it's kind of necessary to

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.010 
so I find that it's kind of necessary to
have<00:05:29.410> two<00:05:29.680> brushes<00:05:30.450> previously<00:05:31.450> when<00:05:31.780> i<00:05:31.840> was

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
have two brushes previously when i was

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.470 
have two brushes previously when i was
using<00:05:32.200> this<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.980> flat<00:05:33.190> top<00:05:33.400> for<00:05:33.790> a<00:05:33.820> foundation

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
using this the flat top for a foundation

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.690 
using this the flat top for a foundation

for<00:06:39.500> highlight<00:06:39.920> two<00:06:40.570> typically<00:06:41.570> i<00:06:41.600> use<00:06:41.870> my

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
for highlight two typically i use my

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.590 
for highlight two typically i use my
blush<00:06:42.350> brush<00:06:42.650> for<00:06:43.400> highlight<00:06:43.880> on<00:06:44.060> top<00:06:44.300> of<00:06:44.480> that

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
blush brush for highlight on top of that

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.140 
blush brush for highlight on top of that
but<00:06:44.780> I<00:06:44.840> guess<00:06:45.080> I<00:06:45.290> could<00:06:45.770> use<00:06:45.800> I<00:06:46.460> was<00:06:46.940> saying

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
but I guess I could use I was saying

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.360 
but I guess I could use I was saying
that<00:06:47.300> I<00:06:47.390> thought<00:06:47.600> that<00:06:47.750> this<00:06:47.950> small<00:06:48.950> angled

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
that I thought that this small angled

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.700 
that I thought that this small angled
one<00:06:49.610> was<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.300> weakest<00:06:50.660> brush<00:06:50.900> in<00:06:51.170> the<00:06:51.200> lot<00:06:51.470> I

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
one was the weakest brush in the lot I

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.620 
one was the weakest brush in the lot I
suppose<00:06:52.310> I<00:06:52.430> could<00:06:52.460> use<00:06:52.760> this<00:06:52.970> one<00:06:53.180> for<00:06:53.330> blush

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
suppose I could use this one for blush

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.750 
suppose I could use this one for blush
and<00:06:54.020> then<00:06:54.200> this<00:06:54.380> one<00:06:54.440> for<00:06:54.830> highlight<00:06:55.310> just<00:06:55.580> on

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
and then this one for highlight just on

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.040 
and then this one for highlight just on
top<00:06:55.910> of<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.240> cheekbone<00:06:56.830> so<00:06:57.830> at<00:06:58.160> any<00:06:58.430> rate<00:06:59.050> if

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
top of the cheekbone so at any rate if

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.390
