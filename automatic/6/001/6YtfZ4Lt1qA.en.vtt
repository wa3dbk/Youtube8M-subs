initially got this I wanted to use it as
a<00:01:18.869> sealant<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.880> heavy<00:01:21.090> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
a sealant because it was so heavy in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.219 
a sealant because it was so heavy in
oils<00:01:21.750> however<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.310> mixture<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
oils however the mixture with it so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.010 
oils however the mixture with it so
having<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.520> conditioners<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
having the conditioners in there and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.800 
having the conditioners in there and
water<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> aloe<00:01:28.799> vera<00:01:29.100> juice<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
water and aloe vera juice it kind of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
water and aloe vera juice it kind of
didn't<00:01:31.049> work<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.100> me<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
didn't work out like that for me it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
didn't work out like that for me it
basically<00:01:33.140> kind<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.229> made<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.500> hair<00:01:34.680> stringy

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
basically kind of made my hair stringy

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
basically kind of made my hair stringy
because<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.729> heavy<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> didn't<00:01:36.930> really

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
because it's heavy and it didn't really

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
because it's heavy and it didn't really
absorb<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> way<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.070> top<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.399> my<00:01:38.490> other

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
absorb all the way on top of my other

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
absorb all the way on top of my other
styling<00:01:39.119> products<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.990> didn't<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.259> like

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
styling products so I didn't really like

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
styling products so I didn't really like
it<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.810> there<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:42.840> definitely

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it like that but there are definitely

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
it like that but there are definitely
other<00:01:43.259> ways<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.860> learned<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> use<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
other ways I learned to use it and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.569 
other ways I learned to use it and
really<00:01:45.270> liked<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.170> number<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.399> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
really liked it so number one you can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
really liked it so number one you can
use<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> heavier<00:01:48.659> leave-in<00:01:48.930> especially

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
use it as a heavier leave-in especially

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.010 
use it as a heavier leave-in especially
in<00:01:49.979> winter<00:01:50.549> time<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.840> great

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
in winter time I think that's great

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.240 
in winter time I think that's great
because<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.500> kind<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.950> leave-in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
because it's kind of like a leave-in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370 
because it's kind of like a leave-in
feeling<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.479> did<00:01:54.719> have<00:01:54.930> enough<00:01:55.140> stuff

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
feeling in one it did have enough stuff

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.770 
feeling in one it did have enough stuff
for<00:01:55.409> me<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.219> put<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.670> naked<00:01:57.119> hair<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.570> also

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
for me to put it on naked hair it's also

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.429 
for me to put it on naked hair it's also
great<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.860> use<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.509> twists<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> twist<00:02:01.259> out

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
great to use for twists or a twist out

lake<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.630> was<00:04:04.930> playing<00:04:05.230> with<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.620> lot<00:04:05.980> more

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
lake I was playing with it a lot more

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.949 
lake I was playing with it a lot more
because<00:04:06.490> this<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.910> first<00:04:07.180> job<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.450> got<00:04:07.540> just

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
because this is the first job I got just

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.590 
because this is the first job I got just
testing<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.380> more<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.040> still<00:04:09.340> it's<00:04:09.730> only<00:04:09.970> it's

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
testing it more but still it's only it's

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.520 
testing it more but still it's only it's
not<00:04:10.840> even<00:04:11.110> half<00:04:11.380> on<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.180> yeah<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.080> think<00:04:14.290> that's

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
not even half on so yeah I think that's

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.630 
not even half on so yeah I think that's
when<00:04:14.650> they<00:04:14.740> don't<00:04:14.830> have<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.069> say<00:04:15.310> about<00:04:15.490> it

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
when they don't have to say about it

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.150 
when they don't have to say about it
because<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.810> it's<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.739> nice<00:04:17.889> product

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
because it's just it's a nice product

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.479 
because it's just it's a nice product
it's<00:04:18.430> very<00:04:18.609> versatile<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.359> just<00:04:19.959> think<00:04:20.169> of

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it's very versatile just just think of

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.490 
it's very versatile just just think of
how<00:04:21.489> heavy<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.210> when<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.750> get<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.200> like<00:04:23.230> you

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
how heavy it is when you get it like you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.100 
how heavy it is when you get it like you
don't<00:04:23.620> want<00:04:23.889> to<00:04:23.950> try<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.310> just<00:04:24.790> use<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.900> all

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
don't want to try to just use it all

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.020 
don't want to try to just use it all
willy-nilly<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.770> then<00:04:27.100> also<00:04:27.280> if<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.790> have

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
willy-nilly and then also if you have

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.270 
willy-nilly and then also if you have
fine<00:04:28.330> hair<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:29.290> might<00:04:29.440> just<00:04:29.800> want<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.100> stick

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
fine hair you might just want to stick

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.920 
fine hair you might just want to stick
with<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.669> moisturizer<00:04:31.150> because<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:31.780> said

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
with the moisturizer because like I said

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.409 
with the moisturizer because like I said
this<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.410> very<00:04:32.680> heavy<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.100> has<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.880> Castros

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
this is very heavy and has the Castros

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.320 
this is very heavy and has the Castros
like<00:04:34.630> weight<00:04:34.840> higher<00:04:35.110> on<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.919> list<00:04:36.130> than<00:04:36.370> the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
like weight higher on the list than the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.380 
like weight higher on the list than the
moisturizer<00:04:38.230> so<00:04:38.770> that's<00:04:39.550> pretty<00:04:39.820> much<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.180> I

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
moisturizer so that's pretty much it I

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.710 
moisturizer so that's pretty much it I
was<00:04:40.780> not<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.020> go<00:04:41.110> there<00:04:41.380> alright
