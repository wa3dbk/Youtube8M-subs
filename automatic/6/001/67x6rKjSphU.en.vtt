Lillee<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.830> recall<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.189> incident<00:00:29.760> he

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
Lillee do you recall that incident he

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.430 
Lillee do you recall that incident he
was<00:00:31.250> still<00:00:32.250> very<00:00:32.489> very<00:00:33.239> good<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.870> me<00:00:34.050> for

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
was still very very good on me for

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
was still very very good on me for
rejecting<00:00:35.399> him<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> fast<00:00:36.030> bowler<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:38.030> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
rejecting him as a fast bowler and that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.170 
rejecting him as a fast bowler and that
he<00:00:39.149> became<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> greatest<00:00:40.800> ever<00:00:41.340> batsman

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
he became of the greatest ever batsman

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
he became of the greatest ever batsman
so<00:00:42.480> maybe<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> persevered<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.579> him<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
so maybe if I persevered with him as a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
so maybe if I persevered with him as a
as<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> fast<00:00:45.989> bowler<00:00:46.260> he<00:00:46.980> might<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.579> work

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
as a fast bowler he might not have work

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.119 
as a fast bowler he might not have work
on<00:00:48.030> his<00:00:48.149> bat<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.870> doubt<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
on his bat I doubt it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
on his bat I doubt it
I<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.700> he<00:00:50.789> left<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> height

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I think he left a little bit of height

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
I think he left a little bit of height
it<00:00:52.500> wouldn't<00:00:52.800> got<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.190> bounce<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.760> some

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it wouldn't got as much bounce as some

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
it wouldn't got as much bounce as some
of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.120> other<00:00:54.270> bowlers<00:00:54.539> he'll<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.350> sure

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
of the other bowlers he'll now I'm sure

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439 
of the other bowlers he'll now I'm sure
I<00:00:55.710> understand<00:00:56.399> mode<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> gives

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
I understand mode but that that gives

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.729 
I understand mode but that that gives
him<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> good<00:00:57.780> center<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> balance<00:00:58.440> ourselves

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
him a good center of balance ourselves

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
him a good center of balance ourselves
for<00:00:59.399> battle<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> recall<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.390> incident
