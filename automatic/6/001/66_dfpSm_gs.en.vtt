00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.490
 hakuna matata ladies and gentlemen here they 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.519
 I bring a new video in which I'm going 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.370
 to teach how to download pc maps from 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.870
 minecraft and pass them to our xbox and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.670
 good first thing we're going to do before 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 to start downloading maps to the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.680
 crazy and everything they want first 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.270
 We need a usb USB's will 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.520
 connect to our xbox we're going to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.640
 configure so that our xbox the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.770
 recognize and how can you see well here in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.850
 storage unit memory this is 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.830
 the new one that I put and I just 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.960
 configure so that my xbox recognizes it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.430
 what we are going to do is we are going to go 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.489
 to the system we are going to go to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.140
 storage we 're going to go to the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.030
 unit where we have our minecraft 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.800
 I in this case have it on the disk 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.719
 hard then let's go to games and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 applications and we're going to look for our 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.380
 minecraft good I think that over here 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.380
 stamp 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.120
 here is minecraft and we are going to choose a 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.740
 map does not matter which is not going to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 lose nothing will happen then by 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 example choose this we will give 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 copy and we will give to move to unit 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.600
 of memory it is important that we give 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.310
 copy because this is usb we are going to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 use will be just to download 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.210
 pc maps and so then so you do not 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 have to be doing this step every 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 once they download a map 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.030
 I recommend you leave that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 file already inside your sb if you get 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.210
 move it will have to go back 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 if they want the map so it's 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.690
 as more relax not good then a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 Once they have that, I see them in the computer and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.750
 good as you can see we are already here in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.740
 our desk ok then what 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.210
 we are going to do is go to the page of 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 youtube on which we want to download the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.800
 map in this case let's get into like 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.300
 can you see is my channel in this in this 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.100
 Video is where I have the house ironman 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.710
 because then many do not know then 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 I'm going to leave the link of this video in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.070
 the description to download it and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 this is done in any other videos 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.210
 so they want to download it from another one from another 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.520
 person any map 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.369
 Internet forgiveness you can do so 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.979
 same then you click on it in the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.540
 download link not every page is 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.700
 different I put it on mediafire 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.320
 then they will give in download and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.229
 we will download once it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 download it will not take long going to 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.100
 take about 30 seconds 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.450
 approximately and once it 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.670
 download what we are going to happen to our 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.810
 I'm telling you, let's go to the desk 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.540
 need a program that is called 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.770
 bryson this this program left them 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 also the link in the description is 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.560
 You can download it for free here 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 they install in like five minutes and in two 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.480
 seconds have everything ready 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.720
 then well let's open this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.890
 good file to pass it to the computer 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.599
 and how they can see it puts us as a 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.319
 little sheet of paper, that's not normal 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.900
 so what we are going to do next is 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.250
 minimize this minimize it can be 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.120
 weird what do you want and we are going to open 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.120
 now and they are not 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.160
 it does not take long to open up it gets its 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.260
 nice logo this and it opens now and healthy 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.190
 and well, then let it open 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.170
 our now and are we going to connect 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.270
 our usb device in which 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.740
 we have our map and what it is going to do 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.900
 is going to be the next thing we're going to click on 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.600
 here we will give you here on the little arrow 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.010
 of game and we will give you in minecraft no 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.590
 as you can see here is our 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.780
 our map not then what are we going to 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.250
 see what we're going to drag and they have to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.110
 remember very well what is your map and 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.080
 which one they downloaded because this 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.810
 is the most important step and at the same 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.130
 time the easiest not then are we 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.630
 this appears where is here is not to 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.430
 I'd be right now appears exactly 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.990
 same but because it's from my same console 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.300
 then imagine that this one is the 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.100
 that you download brings some numbers here 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.250
 strange is that we have no idea that 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.040
 they are here too 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.959
 oh shit is so true 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.939
 and in the same mother is down here 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.489
 well not then what do we have 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.590
 what to do then very easy from our map 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.019
 let's copy this thing that is the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.989
 profile aid and we will give control 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.109
 or right click and copy we're going to go 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.390
 here to the same place we will delete it and 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.709
 We are going to give you control or control 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.900
 right I say left button of the right 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.730
 forgive and paste and do the same with this 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.730
 thing then it has given us in control c 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.200
 we put it back here and how can 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.290
 see there is changing and again control ce 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.180
 and control b then once already 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.130
 have this so let's say that this was the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.690
 map that we download the ironman what 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.670
 what he's going to do is give him who six 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.090
 angel stripes sainz no 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.940
 We will give you a list and we will give it to you 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.880
 safe to device 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.460
 we are going to see him 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.570
 and that's it, that's all, once that 's it 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.900
 that we just do we can close 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.030
 this we already give you that if here so 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.040
 we close and we can take our 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.860
 usb device we can already 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.380
 disconnect and we can pass it to our 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.810
 xbox and good as you can see right now 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.390
 we go back to our xbox and connect the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.650
 device of the usb device and what 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.270
 we are going to do is go again to the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.590
 storage system configuration 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.950
 let's go to the usb we use to 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.210
 make this map thing good we're going 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.280
 to minecraft and how can we see here 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.840
 we will have two and was going to say 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.390
 our name because because 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.370
 we change the console number the number 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.050
 in profile and another thing that I have no idea 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.350
 which is then let's say that this was the 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.330
 that we download and we are going to move and what 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.010
 let's move on to our hard drive yo 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.820
 is your going to tell me what 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.860
 replace because I would already have two from home 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.140
 of ironman but it does not matter and this one like 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.180
 we copy it we can leave it in our 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.830
 in this usb for the only thing we have 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.420
 what to do next is download maps and 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.820
 do it again in the compu and not have 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.880
 to do the first step of putting the usb 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.160
 and copy it 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.830
