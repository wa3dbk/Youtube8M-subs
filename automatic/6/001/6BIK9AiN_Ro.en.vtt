00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.830
 Oh , then I have to listen 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.970
 That's what gingeo dirty Sore him, Reds 1 part of the film as soon as the bread and Examples 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:22.630
 One restaurant that Bora is going to feel Bournemouth 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 I'll talk to you 4 I think you know something 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.849
 4 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.880
 uh 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:33.890
 Calling some chose North 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.950
 The people are both fast and one year. 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.530
 I was so impressed with it. 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 Yes, what are you ? 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.720
 Even then, I get a lot of wind to the South Wind 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.220
 There is not even a majority in the writing process . 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.000
 I am good because 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.000
 There's a little bit of that prejudice . 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:08.460
 What itjyo But sometimes that's why I'm thinking I'd better examples 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 Anyway, I can not because someone is different Oh, the idea is the same for each individual 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.910
 One man's obsession stuck to one person Each place is a good chance to come out water 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.479
 I do not think there is. 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:25.280
 But that's really neither fight bakgo hit two euros ridiculous 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.280
 Because it is a work of opinion to take out the better thing 5 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.570
 OMG 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.380
 Oh, I think something like this is anyway a little between 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:48.310
 What stage is also need to think anyone should think it is 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 Compared to these days, the next time I thought about the tube rather than 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.850
 Ah but that is a task 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.180
 The fact that there is nothing like that 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.030
 I think it's a little more abnormal. 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.320
 Why do something like that together something not even know myself anyway jobs 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.540
 It's work. 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:19.940
 It 's not just my opinion , but this guy's going the wrong way. 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:27.350
 Because there is that sense of trying to grab something called 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:30.790
 If the former is a good idea'm finished doing something that is bad geureongeol 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.790
 I think it will be 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.120
 5 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.910
 What to do 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.570
 I can not treat you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.570
 What attracted 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.550
 That's what I'm talking about now . 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.550
 So then I do not really buy it at the very very now 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.700
 Well that'll be 5 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.380
