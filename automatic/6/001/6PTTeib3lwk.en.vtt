that's pretty sticky sometimes it's kind

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.130 
that's pretty sticky sometimes it's kind
of<00:04:47.330> tricky<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:48.830> get<00:04:48.980> it<00:04:49.160> off<00:04:49.340> but<00:04:49.900> they<00:04:50.900> usually

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
of tricky to get it off but they usually

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.670 
of tricky to get it off but they usually
decide<00:04:51.860> that<00:04:52.190> this<00:04:52.370> stuck<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.990> plastic

it's the shiny side you know this is
cherry<00:05:03.230> flavor<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.920> believe<00:05:04.430> on<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.450> example<00:05:06.320> I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
cherry flavor I believe on the example I

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.940 
cherry flavor I believe on the example I
did<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.040> grape<00:05:07.960> grape<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.200> may<00:05:09.470> be<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.650> little

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
did the grape grape this may be a little

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.370 
did the grape grape this may be a little
nicer<00:05:10.610> because<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.510> shows<00:05:11.840> more<00:05:12.140> like<00:05:12.350> a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
nicer because it shows more like a

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.290 
nicer because it shows more like a
tinted<00:05:12.860> window<00:05:13.310> or<00:05:13.490> some<00:05:14.050> start<00:05:15.050> just<00:05:16.300> by

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
tinted window or some start just by

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.960 
tinted window or some start just by
cutting<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.900> strip<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:21.520> sometimes<00:05:22.520> we<00:05:22.820> just

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
cutting a strip and sometimes we just

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.129 
cutting a strip and sometimes we just
measure<00:05:23.270> it's<00:05:23.780> about<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.050> finger<00:05:24.380> life

you<00:05:27.680> know<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.949> doesn't<00:05:28.129> have<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.400> be<00:05:28.669> way

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
you know it doesn't have to be way

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.619
