three to show you because there are

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.039 
three to show you because there are
several<00:00:14.759> variations<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.900> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
several variations you can do on a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.359 
several variations you can do on a
pop-up<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.840> really<00:00:18.840> basic<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.529> for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
pop-up this is a really basic one for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.179 
pop-up this is a really basic one for
panels<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:23.039> this

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
panels you can see that you get this

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.070 
panels you can see that you get this
kind<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> cut<00:00:23.910> corner<00:00:24.449> thing<00:00:26.300> okay<00:00:27.300> from<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
kind of cut corner thing okay from the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.979 
kind of cut corner thing okay from the
shape<00:00:29.240> because<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.420> folded<00:00:32.570> now<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
shape because it's folded now if you

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.450 
shape because it's folded now if you
don't<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.530> shape<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.280> can

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
don't want to see that shape you can

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
don't want to see that shape you can
line<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:36.180> conceal<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> four

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
line it or conceal it this is a four

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.799 
line it or conceal it this is a four
panel<00:00:38.219> piece<00:00:38.430> also<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.090> two<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> panels

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
panel piece also but two of the panels

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
panel piece also but two of the panels
glued<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> back<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.670> can't<00:00:41.969> see

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
glued to the back so that you can't see

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.889 
glued to the back so that you can't see
that<00:00:42.570> angle<00:00:43.190> from<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> pop-up<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that angle from the pop-up so this is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.779 
that angle from the pop-up so this is
another<00:00:46.079> real<00:00:46.320> simple<00:00:46.800> solution<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.670> can

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
another real simple solution so you can

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209 
another real simple solution so you can
glue<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> conceal<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> little

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
glue and conceal it this one is a little

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
glue and conceal it this one is a little
more<00:00:50.520> advanced<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:53.180> can<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> pop-up

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
more advanced you can see the pop-up

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.099 
more advanced you can see the pop-up
areas<00:00:55.590> coming<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> sides<00:00:56.840> this<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
areas coming out from the sides this is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
areas coming out from the sides this is
a<00:00:58.140> four<00:00:58.379> panel<00:00:58.559> piece<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:58.980> well<00:00:59.160> except<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.879> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a four panel piece as well except two of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.830 
a four panel piece as well except two of
the<00:01:00.120> panels<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:01.260> glued<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.210> two<00:01:03.629> panels

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the panels are glued so these two panels

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.600 
the panels are glued so these two panels
are<00:01:04.110> glued<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.220> free<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
are glued and these two are free so

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
are glued and these two are free so
pop-ups<00:01:08.610> usually<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.650> not

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
pop-ups usually are also they're not

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.020 
pop-ups usually are also they're not
always<00:01:11.040> made<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.430> scores<00:01:11.729> they're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
always made with scores they're

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
always made with scores they're
perforations<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.130> perforation<00:01:14.580> helps

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
perforations and the perforation helps

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.340 
perforations and the perforation helps
with<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> tension<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> paper<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
with the tension in the paper and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
with the tension in the paper and
letting<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> air<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.460> also<00:01:17.580> usually

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
letting the air out there's also usually

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390 
letting the air out there's also usually
an<00:01:18.090> extra<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.630> slip<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> base

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
an extra little slip right at the base

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.670 
an extra little slip right at the base
of<00:01:20.430> where<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> point<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.110> releases

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
of where the point is and that releases

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
of where the point is and that releases
the<00:01:23.130> tension<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> prevents<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.270> little

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the tension and prevents that little

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.859 
the tension and prevents that little
crunchy<00:01:25.439> area<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.280> bottom<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.750> can

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
crunchy area at the bottom so as you can

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.319 
crunchy area at the bottom so as you can
see<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.380> there's<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.490> much<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.060> about

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
see there there's so much to think about

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240 
see there there's so much to think about
with<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:31.140> pop-up<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
with a little pop-up and so you really

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
with a little pop-up and so you really
need<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> talk<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.909> printer<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.329> bindery

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
need to talk to your printer or bindery

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
need to talk to your printer or bindery
very<00:01:34.290> early<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.770> often<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.159> would<00:01:35.280> also

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
very early and often I would also

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.830 
very early and often I would also
recommend<00:01:36.530> paper<00:01:37.610> mock<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.509> because

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
recommend paper mock up as well because

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
recommend paper mock up as well because
you<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.110> make<00:01:40.259> sure<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.560> weight<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you want to make sure the weight of the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.080 
you want to make sure the weight of the
paper<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.400> right<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:41.909> also

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
paper is right there are also

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
paper is right there are also
limitations<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> size<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:44.189> pop-up

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
limitations to the size of your pop-up

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.219 
limitations to the size of your pop-up

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
in general handwork specialty folding

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.090 
in general handwork specialty folding
you<00:01:49.530> name<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:51.380> definitely<00:01:52.380> communication

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you name it so definitely communication

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
you name it so definitely communication
is<00:01:53.399> key<00:01:53.579> when<00:01:53.939> doing<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> pop-up<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:55.049> lots<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
is key when doing a pop-up but lots to

is key when doing a pop-up but lots to
think<00:01:55.530> about

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
think about

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
think about
that's<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.520> 60<00:01:56.790> second<00:01:57.119> super<00:01:57.329> cool<00:01:57.479> fold<00:01:57.719> of
