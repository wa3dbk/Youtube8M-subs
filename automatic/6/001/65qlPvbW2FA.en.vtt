in front of him that's why I'm using to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.070 
in front of him that's why I'm using to
a<00:00:59.699> composition<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:01.370> make<00:01:02.370> himself<00:01:02.550> better<00:01:03.359> but

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
a composition to make himself better but

a composition to make himself better but
what<00:01:04.769> did<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> him<00:01:05.400> while<00:01:05.519> using

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
him well I completely agree what you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
him well I completely agree what you
saying<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.430> think<00:01:08.640> he's<00:01:08.850> needs<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> play<00:01:09.750> his

saying I think he's needs to play his
two<00:01:10.020> pasta<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.470> I'd<00:01:11.460> say<00:01:11.790> he's<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:12.090> lazy<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
two pasta two I'd say he's a bit lazy in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.420 
two pasta two I'd say he's a bit lazy in
terms<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.049> running<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> ball<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.280> those

terms of running for the ball all those

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
terms of running for the ball all those
stats<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
stats don't really make up for what you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.200 
stats don't really make up for what you
actually<00:01:17.220> asked<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> didn't<00:01:17.909> think<00:01:18.000> he<00:01:18.150> was

the<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> perfect

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the right I think that was the perfect

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.440 
the right I think that was the perfect
the<00:01:59.610> best<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.030> around<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the best you can get around in the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
the best you can get around in the
perfect<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.049> team<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.610> honest<00:02:02.820> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
perfect kind of team or to be honest I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.700 
perfect kind of team or to be honest I
say<00:02:03.149> Joe<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> best<00:02:03.750> i<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.469> how

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
say Joe but the best i was in with how

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.180 
say Joe but the best i was in with how
he<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:05.009> playing<00:02:05.219> him<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:07.170> yeah<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.619> feel

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
he was playing him so but yeah I feel

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.410 
he was playing him so but yeah I feel
think<00:02:08.580> he's<00:02:08.670> perfect<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> striking

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
think he's perfect for the striking

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.650 
think he's perfect for the striking
position<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:10.520> think<00:02:11.520> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.330> were<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.540> to

position I think if you were going to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.760 
position I think if you were going to
get<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
get in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.370

would actually rate the players I mean
Josh<00:03:15.540> what<00:03:16.200> would<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.410> rate<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.940> Patrick<00:03:17.940> out

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
Josh what would you rate and Patrick out

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.040 
Josh what would you rate and Patrick out
of<00:03:18.570> 10<00:03:18.810> overall<00:03:19.709> well<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:21.030> striker<00:03:21.630> position

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
of 10 overall well in striker position

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.530 
of 10 overall well in striker position
I'd<00:03:22.170> rate<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> thick<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:24.209> thinking

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
I'd rate in a thick and I thinking

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.240 
I'd rate in a thick and I thinking
composition<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.230> seven<00:03:25.560> definitely<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.040> family

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
composition of seven definitely a family

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.699 
composition of seven definitely a family
