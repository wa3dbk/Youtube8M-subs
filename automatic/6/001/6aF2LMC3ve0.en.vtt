00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 what we are going to see next is a 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.250
 form of 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.250
 play the guitar different to the one we are used to 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 where he knows them 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.599
 chord are the positions per hundred of 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.890
 building will not be made 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.669
 It is by means of hand orders 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.169
 left 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.849
 or exceptionally they are going to be used but fundamentally by this one tommy 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:27.789
 metal towers 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 that is called the aecc in some video cases 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 in the history from which it goes back 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.610
 aol 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.160
 today that mobile America a few years ago last century 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 i the life during these last times many exponents 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.280
 is the idea 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 in some traditional cases like 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.130
 recoder and in some cases the traditional I mean paqui faces 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.280
 aco acoustic or okita ras east 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.250
 classic 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 percent 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.640
 on the electric guitar 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 like for example ochoa winter out 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570
 with mickey rourke was last year in the country 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.590
 and the closure in parana on the good network there are two ways to work it once with 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.710
 the final guitar in its traditional form 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 nor if they are reveal me the normal tuning of the guitar 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.750
 and another one that is tuning 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.329
 the guitar in such a way that touched the air that I remembered greater 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.830
 although they are gladdening detunctions in which they are going to finance their 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.680
 affiliation is rather someone who has popularized them a lot in the cerebellum and 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.520
 touching a very clear months for 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.630
 to mark topics that richard team 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.880
 per cent the law the agnaddafi was born in april 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.440
 commonly percent estimated me 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.580
 count 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.900
 that the third and fifth tonic of which he speaks and I positioned myself because we 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.170
 affiliations obviously my yielded a little sharper 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.469
 and on the way a sun that also the positions are going to be the same 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.810
 I use a not so conventional not so common but it is very good result 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.260
 at the time of finding percent and in the work arrangements they seek 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.359
 yes greater 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.319
 yes greater open 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.029
 for this 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.659
 elsy mayor is the note itself 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.659
 prayers had fifa sharp 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.529
 to the second we would not have 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.659
 with the felling and that's not the way 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.719
 to achieve those feared we go down the first and the sixth half tone 'oceans' 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.659
 me harris has had 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 the third that only to spend sustained afa 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.609
 the fourth we are going to increase it to reeds 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.739
 i the fifth will go to the water to be the only one that we are going to throw 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.559
 more than the others is this is a the naturally will take a sip 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.799
 this way we have left I have not sustained 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.059
 prisoners had 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.819
 F sharp 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.259
 resistant third
