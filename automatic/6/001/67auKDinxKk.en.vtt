00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.230
 Hi everyone, everything good

 Today I'm here to say only that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.420

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.939
 little more life is so old 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.349
 but a more classic thing if and you 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.090
 You must be wondering what I am. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.399
 coming back with dark lipstick because 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.380
 I do not really use more shades. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 dark but I'm here to bring the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 diversity for extras recommendations 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 different. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.270
 there I like one thing the business of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 yesterday everyone who's in it if you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.820
 guys to start our makeup use 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 the color 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 maybelline I care cuts that you're 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.719
 24 hours in the shade of authorization to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.739
 Who does not know to buy it is in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.990
 a crown of a thing you can use a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.700
 Shadow to use as a base 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.409
 For shade I was going through the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.860
 killer way to pass 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.470
 He has this creamy texture. 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.110
 pearly shimmering I'll apply for 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.979
 all my agenda has been vetoed since 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 I start here in the inner corner 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 chelsea we would now be the palette of 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.549
 3 shadows since I can handle it and I go 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.850
 start using this shadow here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.340
 This hopscotch here, then get a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 brush answers dinho, how are you? 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.180
 You know I do not know better. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.549
 to pass on 3d is to win the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
 dots in doubt because she talks 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.939
 too much 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.579
 I started applying since it had 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.549
 internal publish until more or less here 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.259
 almost at the end of our time giving 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.259
 spitting 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.860
 I've already passed the yellow shade. 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.250
 from the beginning to the very end rate 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.399
 It was very vibrant now to use this color 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.760
 here it's hard to write color is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:19.099
 because it is a line neither rust nor copper 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.470
 them happens a shade brush and 30mm 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:26.930
 talk about my voice 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.209
 I can only here the neighboring half of him 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.730
 I'll give a cool pass and do 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.980
 circular movements people talking 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.650
 to be an effect is of 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.989
 transition for us to go here 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.340
 in the corner of the eye to enjoy what the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.980
 people are conquering a little bit of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.680
 surya from this shadow I'll score in the middle 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.709
 with car that was the mark 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.810
 very low foliage of ours down here 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.340
 Then the eyebrows passing 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 brand 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.620
 I came with this one and also the rust 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.450
 're redder this is this is the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.030

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:20.690

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:22.720

 here comes evil, nor does it have to be cute 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:36.530
 brand again said may be the end that 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.010
 you have a well-mixed team in these 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.900
 waves 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.639
 now I came with a darker shade 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.829
 which also has a cast but is a shadow 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:50.709
 shiny 3d she looks like a little girl 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:57.079

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.790
 he is excellent 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.709
 there is going to be that half-merged thing 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.739
 In this we also live with a 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.829
 brush of vanilla will talk about 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.940

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.840
 more rounded expression to give a 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.410

 even more so our eyes lift and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.669
