00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 they are often unfairly invoked 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.460
 while the matches of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.799
 football because the fan names it 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.289
 regrets the recalls required I am 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.590
 talking about mothers of mothers of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.920
 football players we know something of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 they really got involved with their 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.000
 stories those women who gave birth 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 to the true idols of the number 5 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.270
 see this report let's find out more 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.650
 about her

 [Music] 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.710
 I'm Argentine but I live in the USA 28 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.750
 years ago a year ago I decided based on 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.610
 education to the sport of wanting to write 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.100
 a book that will inspire people and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.600
 I thought the best way to get there with 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.910
 this message was to interview the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.710
 better then I decided to look for the 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.450
 best players in the world and their 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.670
 parents who are the best 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.940
 they know and they are the ones who have made 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.559
 those let's say normal boys are 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 will transform the superstars that are 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.940
 been admired by millions and from there 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.520
 because the book my son was born football 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.619
 that we have first paid attention to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.390
 dad so much because it's also 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.030
 traditionally and worldwide a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.159
 rather masculine sport although yes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.310
 to transcending also with women 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.369
 I interviewed the best portals 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.700
 like the parents of leonel messi maradona 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 Zinedine Zidane Live Drogba Ronaldinho 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.830
 Andres Iniesta David Villa de Paolo 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.810
 maldini oliver kahn 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.070
 johan craig who is a person who does not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.520
 he wants to talk to nobody Dutch 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.670
 clarence and 2 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.320
 that is more than 50 in the denominator 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.479
 common among all parents of all 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.270
 someone so spectacular and touching 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 how is don diego toro maradona dad 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.050
 from diego este ellos 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.190
 and they did not see their children as a 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.870
 figures that were going to save him 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.340
 economically we all know the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.590
 poverty which came to family 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.810
 maradona and yet thanks to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 talent of the effort of the Greeks as 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.410
 they could get ahead but man 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.509
 keep this humility that kindness is a 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.690
 adorable man about dads of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.520
 messi I loved the humility of rather 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.520
 of jorge messi of his parents 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.350
 because he is a person who speaks as well as 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.810
 that if you were talking to a friend and 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.180
 he has been not only a great support but 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.390
 who also believed in the skills 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.640
 of lionel when he was a kid 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.070
 a growth problem rather 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.560
 to bring the good airs and make 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.050
 some things that were not the ones that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.720
 they liked Spain they came to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 take to Barcelona and they were 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.690
 all the time with him obviously the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.730
 best player in the world 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.650
 He also had his great challenges and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.920
 big problems and at a very old age 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.660
 small however they saw the great 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.940
 talent that I had with him and where I could 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.410
 come and believed in him and want and 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.340
 many of us many and we stayed 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.860
 in 80% of the effort in 95% of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 forces when it reaches 110 motility 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.710
 percent and I with what Jorge did 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.260
 Mexico 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.080
 lionel's mom in being with him and 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.920
 believe in him and so good today because of that 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.950
 It is the best of all 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.950
