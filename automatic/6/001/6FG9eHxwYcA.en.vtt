00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
that anymore that's what may be one of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.930 
that anymore that's what may be one of
the<00:02:47.019> main<00:02:47.170> reasons<00:02:47.530> why<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.340> past<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.760> call

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
the main reasons why the past you call

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.420 
the main reasons why the past you call
of<00:02:49.060> duty's<00:02:49.330> he's<00:02:49.569> not<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> huge<00:02:50.049> fan<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:51.159> that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
of duty's he's not a huge fan of so that

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.339 
of duty's he's not a huge fan of so that
could<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.670> why<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:52.000> still<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:52.989> know<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.170> don't

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
could be why I still don't know I don't

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.479 
could be why I still don't know I don't
know<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.620> he<00:02:53.769> even<00:02:53.799> knows<00:02:54.129> but<00:02:54.430> that

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
know if he even knows but that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.130 
know if he even knows but that
definitely<00:02:54.819> has<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> contributing<00:02:55.720> factor<00:02:55.780> to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
definitely has a contributing factor to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.520 
definitely has a contributing factor to
it<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.500> sure<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:57.519> anyways<00:02:57.909> uh<00:02:58.470> pretty<00:02:59.470> much

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it for sure but anyways uh pretty much

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.869 
it for sure but anyways uh pretty much
where<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.799> started<00:03:00.099> playing<00:03:00.250> called<00:03:00.549> duty<00:03:00.849> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
was basing it off of wings of redemption

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.770 
was basing it off of wings of redemption
to<00:03:03.069> play<00:03:03.250> style<00:03:03.519> which<00:03:03.760> at<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.030> time<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.480> his

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
to play style which at the time was his

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.869 
to play style which at the time was his
defensive<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.799> know<00:03:05.920> can't<00:03:06.220> be<00:03:06.370> placed<00:03:06.640> up

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
which pretty much is how I started

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.369

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
that I used to play and it's kind of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.909 
that I used to play and it's kind of
upsetting<00:03:51.519> because<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.870> know<00:03:53.230> I'd<00:03:53.500> be<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.650> better

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
upsetting because I know I'd be a better

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.640 
upsetting because I know I'd be a better
player<00:03:54.280> but<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.419> YouTube<00:03:55.750> videos<00:03:56.230> would<00:03:56.440> be

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
player but the YouTube videos would be

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.140 
player but the YouTube videos would be
as<00:03:56.739> good<00:03:57.040> because<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.669> know<00:03:57.760> they'd<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.120> more

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
as good because you know they'd be more

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150 
as good because you know they'd be more
passive<00:03:58.840> but<00:03:59.440> I'm<00:03:59.560> starting<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.859> think<00:03:59.919> maybe

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
passive but I'm starting to think maybe

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.289 
passive but I'm starting to think maybe
that's<00:04:00.400> what<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.579> should<00:04:00.639> just<00:04:00.910> base<00:04:01.120> my

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
that's what I should just base my

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.229 
that's what I should just base my
channel<00:04:01.629> around<00:04:01.840> more<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.200> passive<00:04:02.739> player

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
channel around more of a passive player

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.159 
channel around more of a passive player
you<00:04:04.239> know<00:04:04.329> that<00:04:04.599> doesn't<00:04:04.780> mean<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.139> can't

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
you know that doesn't mean that I can't

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.020 
you know that doesn't mean that I can't
do<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.859> rushing<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.400> doesn't<00:04:06.699> mean<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:06.849> that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
do the rushing it doesn't mean that that
