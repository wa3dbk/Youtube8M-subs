and<00:00:20.840> that's<00:00:21.020> because<00:00:21.439> it's<00:00:21.650> an<00:00:21.770> original

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
and that's because it's an original

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.920 
and that's because it's an original
design<00:00:22.490> that<00:00:22.520> my<00:00:22.880> customer<00:00:23.390> wanted<00:00:23.750> he<00:00:23.900> said

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
especially up here but that worked out I

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.999 
especially up here but that worked out I
was<00:01:40.939> able<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.240> modify<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:41.990> Cape<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.710> he<00:01:42.799> came

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
was able to modify the Cape that he came

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.770 
was able to modify the Cape that he came
with<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.490> had<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> shoulder<00:01:44.060> pads<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.509> that

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
with and had the shoulder pads to that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.780 
with and had the shoulder pads to that
and<00:01:45.049> then<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.650> head<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:46.369> took<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.610> lot<00:01:46.759> of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
and then the head just took a lot of

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.850 
and then the head just took a lot of
hollowing<00:01:47.270> out<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.079> that<00:01:48.259> ended<00:01:48.560> up<00:01:48.619> fitting

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
hollowing out but that ended up fitting

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.789 
hollowing out but that ended up fitting
as<00:01:49.159> well<00:01:49.869> because<00:01:50.869> those<00:01:50.990> figures<00:01:51.259> had<00:01:51.439> really

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
as well because those figures had really

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.740 
as well because those figures had really
big<00:01:51.950> heads<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.729> worked<00:01:52.909> perfectly<00:01:53.360> for

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
big heads and it worked perfectly for

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.859 
big heads and it worked perfectly for
this<00:01:53.960> size<00:01:54.200> figure<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> sculpt<00:01:56.720> of

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
this size figure and then the sculpt of

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.630 
this size figure and then the sculpt of
the<00:01:57.049> original<00:01:57.439> armor<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.009> figure<00:01:58.310> worked

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the original armor on the figure worked

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.139 
the original armor on the figure worked
out<00:01:58.820> nicely<00:01:59.090> with<00:01:59.299> the<00:02:00.729> parts<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:01.880> had<00:02:02.030> to

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
out nicely with the parts that I had to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.090 
out nicely with the parts that I had to
add<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.600> him<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.170> was<00:02:03.350> pretty<00:02:03.590> happy<00:02:03.829> with

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
add to him so I was pretty happy with

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.310 
add to him so I was pretty happy with
that<00:02:04.340> modified<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.420> loincloth<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:06.229> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
that modified the loincloth just a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.740 
that modified the loincloth just a
little<00:02:06.560> bit<00:02:06.770> modified<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.820> belt<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.390> then

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
little bit modified the belt and then

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.930 
little bit modified the belt and then
this<00:02:08.899> sword<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.500> from<00:02:09.890> some<00:02:10.100> spawn<00:02:10.369> figure<00:02:10.729> but

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
this sword is from some spawn figure but

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.660 
this sword is from some spawn figure but
I<00:02:10.970> had<00:02:11.329> to<00:02:11.420> sand<00:02:11.660> down<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.049> blade<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.670> this

I had to sand down the blade and this

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.280 
I had to sand down the blade and this
piece<00:02:13.910> here<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.450> didn't<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.840> any<00:02:14.989> spawn

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.540 
bald piece with the spike on it comes
off<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.830> slides<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.400> of

off so that just slides in and out of

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.020 
off so that just slides in and out of
his<00:02:25.610> hand

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
his hand

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.210 
his hand
fairly<00:02:26.989> easily<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.500> he<00:02:27.560> doesn't<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.920> hold

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
fairly easily so he doesn't have to hold

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040 
fairly easily so he doesn't have to hold
that<00:02:28.370> all<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.819> time<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.540> then<00:02:29.629> this<00:02:29.810> claw

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
that all the time and then this claw

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.900 
that all the time and then this claw
hand<00:02:30.349> while<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.800> looks<00:02:30.980> cool<00:02:31.220> like<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.670> I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
hand while it looks cool like that I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.940 
hand while it looks cool like that I
thought<00:02:32.209> would<00:02:32.390> be<00:02:32.420> extra<00:02:32.989> nice<00:02:33.170> because<00:02:33.830> I

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
thought would be extra nice because I

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.050 
thought would be extra nice because I
remember<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.400> game<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.700> could<00:02:34.970> be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
remember in the game I could be

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.520 
remember in the game I could be
remembering<00:02:35.420> incorrectly<00:02:35.930> but<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.230> turtles

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530
