first uncensored impression of this comb
so<00:00:30.609> previously<00:00:31.480> I<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:33.430> using<00:00:33.670> this<00:00:34.120> comb<00:00:34.510> it's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440

think there's some honey in here so

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:14.470 
think there's some honey in here so
let's<00:01:59.959> see<00:02:05.500> all<00:02:06.500> my<00:02:06.829> eye<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:12.079> use<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> lot<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
let's see all my eye and I use a lot and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.199 
let's see all my eye and I use a lot and
a<00:02:14.599> one<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.140> cheap<00:02:19.180> well<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:22.370> haven't<00:02:22.790> just

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
a one it's cheap well and I haven't just

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.180 
a one it's cheap well and I haven't just
tangled<00:02:23.420> my<00:02:23.720> hair<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.049> about<00:02:24.700> four<00:02:25.700> days<00:02:27.190> which

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
tangled my hair in about four days which

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.270 
tangled my hair in about four days which
for<00:02:28.489> me<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.670> kind<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.329> lot<00:02:29.560> cuz<00:02:30.560> my<00:02:30.739> hair<00:02:31.010> gets

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
for me is kind of a lot cuz my hair gets

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.599 
for me is kind of a lot cuz my hair gets
very<00:02:31.340> tangled<00:02:32.500> there<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.889> think<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:34.579> of

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
very tangled there so I think because of

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.210 
very tangled there so I think because of
shed<00:02:35.030> hairs<00:02:35.269> like<00:02:35.569> if<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.840> don't<00:02:36.100> detangle<00:02:37.100> with

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
shed hairs like if I don't detangle with

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.300 
shed hairs like if I don't detangle with
a<00:02:37.250> comb<00:02:37.549> I<00:02:37.819> basically<00:02:38.269> have<00:02:38.709> no<00:02:40.069> hairs

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
a comb I basically have no hairs

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.340 
a comb I basically have no hairs
for<00:02:40.579> that<00:02:40.730> day<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.630> think<00:02:41.660> they<00:02:41.989> just<00:02:42.049> get

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
for that day and I think they just get

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.210 
for that day and I think they just get
all<00:02:42.440> caught<00:02:42.769> up<00:02:42.829> in<00:02:43.310> my<00:02:44.120> hair<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.620> I'm<00:02:46.069> not

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
all caught up in my hair so I'm not

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.220

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
going to have to do twists or anything's
