00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.929
 there are 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 I hope that's only percent 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 Nothing is a kind of event meant to be just forgotten 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.310
 the classic 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.890
 Thurmond sold locally with lots we have lots of accessories for 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 but to turn it into an engine that tells you what to do for an hour 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.630
 Lord to the hardest terrain 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.580
 works and it can also be moved relatively quickly that's it 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
 especially 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 Dean actually sees us alone 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.100
 Michalsky has been around for some time 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.350
 Theme with us a bit better in the nice but still on the boat brings the fans 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 also great 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 and what's relatively easy there is something to get there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.110
 It was fun to do and prove something again 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.500
 what we really can do what we last a bit too yes 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 have learned 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.340
 you can get the sponsors on board nicely everything was very interesting 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.770
 and snapped I do not say people will be surprised how about 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 it works 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 I think that we just got the last few years of chassis tuning 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 Alfie have learned what to do, where to develop, what to do 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.730
 Must be based 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.740
 with last year was always so that we did the said 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.050
 and that does not always immediately fit this way so that they are in real more 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.660
 Quite quickly, Roche researchers Internal concluded 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.630
 with two men only mainly 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.030
 and percent that worked very well on the first rollout 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.299
 already specify are actually more or less to have 60 Leander then not 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.109
 we have many other developers 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.519
 also have projects running where 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.889
 can be used here 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.129
 AZ 6s is the foothold we wanted or our partner's designer 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.359
 the proposal will be and a bit and skate the concert hall of Matt 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.089
 and the general to you is right 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.179
 it's just that two people were mainly busy with it 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.449
 everyone else has much more free time to do so 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.449
 but the result has been very good 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.949
 Often also legendary was remembered before my time today 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.609
 more of that 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.319
 Surely it is also safe to dance that's a bit 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.349
 Way to the votes 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.629
 Nonetheless, we believe in us all evolving around 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.569
 know more and more this can work even better 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.919
 meanwhile, they are already closing 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.040
 I'll just say broken things 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.289
 SID and Reuters really looks like 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.679
 the transmitter wants to run off the conveyor belt 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.929
 and they've gotten them far along with sure that Eurex 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 the mother of all 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.859
 Of course, there are many who are particularly the filigree lard tasted 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.049
 have how much 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.400
 also in Switzerland have tasted cases too i think its 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.399
 Training for example club history 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.439
 the school is really special 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.339
 real most luxurious before this class 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:48.699
 So we have one of the öbb sorry the price in terms of features really 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.529
 there is nothing comparable at the moment on the market 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:56.009
 nothing hate more top ten of the same as the shock absorber of the company 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.229
 Tacke that is coming 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.469
 for Ivonne Menzel and then work together with the öfi 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.869
 This is also a damper of the last now also easy with us 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.430
 trying to run and percent that's all very very noble 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.029
 good choice 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:08.849
 his
