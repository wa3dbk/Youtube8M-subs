could<00:00:01.530> say<00:00:01.560> that<00:00:01.860> would<00:00:01.949> sum<00:00:02.190> up<00:00:02.220> bluegill

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
could say that would sum up bluegill

fishing in the wintertime I'd say the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.900 
fishing in the wintertime I'd say the
most<00:00:04.529> important<00:00:05.069> thing<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.490> go<00:00:05.609> light

on<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.439> particular<00:00:25.740> trip<00:00:26.189> mouse<00:00:26.490> these<00:00:26.640> are

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
on this particular trip mouse these are

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.609 
on this particular trip mouse these are
also<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:27.150> good<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.529> an

also very good but you want to have an

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.990 
also very good but you want to have an
assortment<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.130> want<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.820> of

everything to try tear drops kind of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910 
everything to try tear drops kind of
fall<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.669> basic<00:00:32.969> categories<00:00:33.770> ones<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
fall into two basic categories ones that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.650 
fall into two basic categories ones that
hang<00:00:35.130> horizontal<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> water<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
hang horizontal in the water and this is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.250 
hang horizontal in the water and this is
a<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:36.930> example<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.559> horizontal<00:00:38.219> tear<00:00:38.760> drops

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
a good example of horizontal tear drops

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.840 
a good example of horizontal tear drops
these<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.440> designed<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.129> tie<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> line

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
these are designed to tie on the line

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
these are designed to tie on the line
just<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> way<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.420> tie<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.930> let<00:00:43.110> head<00:00:43.320> jig

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
just the way you tie on a let head jig

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
just the way you tie on a let head jig
and<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.820> use<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> good<00:00:45.600> example

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and you use this one is a good example

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.299 
and you use this one is a good example
you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.500> tie<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.739> line<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.129> there

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you can see you tie your line on there

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.650 
you can see you tie your line on there
and<00:00:47.370> they're<00:00:47.489> gonna<00:00:47.610> hang<00:00:47.879> horizontal<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and they're gonna hang horizontal in the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
and they're gonna hang horizontal in the
water<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:50.100> type<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> presentation

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
water this is one type of presentation

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
water this is one type of presentation
that<00:00:51.360> works<00:00:51.539> particularly<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.649> blue

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that works particularly well for blue

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
that works particularly well for blue
gills<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.000> always<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.660> best

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
gills but it's not always the best

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.770 
gills but it's not always the best
presentation<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> group<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
presentation but this group the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.479 
presentation but this group the
horizontal<00:00:58.379> group<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.309> very

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
horizontal group here are very very

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.889 
horizontal group here are very very
handy<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.180> these<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.600> are

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
handy and some of these you can see are

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
handy and some of these you can see are
pretty<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.260> size<00:01:01.530> too<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.760> bigger<00:01:02.940> tear

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
pretty good size too the bigger tear

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
pretty good size too the bigger tear
drops<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> course<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.110> fishing<00:01:04.439> in

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
drops of course are for fishing in

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310 
drops of course are for fishing in
deeper<00:01:04.830> water<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.689> sometimes<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.020> smaller

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
deeper water and sometimes the smaller

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.929 
deeper water and sometimes the smaller
tear<00:01:07.619> drops<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.130> only<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.460> useful<00:01:08.640> in

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
tear drops not only are they useful in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
tear drops not only are they useful in
shallow<00:01:09.180> water<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.630> sometimes<00:01:09.869> finicky<00:01:10.530> fish

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
shallow water but sometimes finicky fish

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.219 
shallow water but sometimes finicky fish
will<00:01:11.010> bite<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> smaller<00:01:11.610> teardrop<00:01:12.200> over<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
will bite a smaller teardrop over a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.510 
will bite a smaller teardrop over a
larger<00:01:13.740> teardrop

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
larger teardrop

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
larger teardrop
these<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.540> vertical<00:01:15.840> tear<00:01:16.200> drops<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
these are vertical tear drops and you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.560 
these are vertical tear drops and you
can<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> line<00:01:17.640> tie<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> top

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
can see that the line tie is on the top

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
can see that the line tie is on the top
of<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.990> instead<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> middle<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
of them instead of in the middle and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
of them instead of in the middle and
they<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.850> designed<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> hang<00:01:21.630> vertical<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
they are designed to hang vertical in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
they are designed to hang vertical in
the<00:01:22.380> water<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.490> clearly<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.840> look<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> little

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the water and clearly they look a little

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
the water and clearly they look a little
different<00:01:25.619> than<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> horizontal<00:01:26.430> style

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
different than the horizontal style

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
different than the horizontal style
teardrop<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.290> cases<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.799> work

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
teardrop and in some cases these work

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
teardrop and in some cases these work
better<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
better I think that this is the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.330 
better I think that this is the
traditional<00:01:31.170> style<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.590> teardrop<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
traditional style of teardrop I think

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
traditional style of teardrop I think
the<00:01:32.430> horizontal<00:01:33.119> ones<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.110> bit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the horizontal ones are a little bit

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350 
the horizontal ones are a little bit
more<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> modern<00:01:35.100> method<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.939> both<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
more of the modern method but both of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
more of the modern method but both of
these<00:01:36.450> work<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.259> would<00:01:37.350> never<00:01:37.560> be

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
these work well and I would never be

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740 
these work well and I would never be
caught<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.430> ice<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.850> without<00:01:39.720> a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
it's another teardrop I put a different

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.460 
it's another teardrop I put a different
type<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.510> bait<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> instead<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.170> putting<00:02:20.290> a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
type of bait on it instead of putting a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.140 
type of bait on it instead of putting a
spike<00:02:20.740> on<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> I've<00:02:21.160> got<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> wax<00:02:21.550> form<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:21.970> this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
spike on it I've got a wax form on this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.240 
spike on it I've got a wax form on this
one<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:22.960> got<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> spike<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.160> I'm

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
one so I got a spike on this one and I'm

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.950 
one so I got a spike on this one and I'm
moving<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.550> pretty<00:02:24.760> aggressively<00:02:25.210> I've<00:02:25.780> got<00:02:25.930> a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
moving it pretty aggressively I've got a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.720 
moving it pretty aggressively I've got a
wax<00:02:26.200> room<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.740> one<00:02:26.920> I'm<00:02:27.100> not<00:02:27.130> moving<00:02:27.610> it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
wax room on this one I'm not moving it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.820 
wax room on this one I'm not moving it
at<00:02:27.820> all<00:02:27.970> what's<00:02:28.300> gonna<00:02:28.450> happen<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.500> there's<00:02:29.770> a

at all what's gonna happen if there's a
fish<00:02:30.040> look<00:02:30.220> at<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.780> looks<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.080> a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
fish look at there this looks like a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.020 
fish look at there this looks like a
smaller<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.680> what's<00:02:33.250> gonna<00:02:33.400> happen<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:33.940> the

smaller one what's gonna happen is the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.760 
smaller one what's gonna happen is the
fish<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.240> come<00:02:34.540> into<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.900> hole<00:02:35.080> are<00:02:35.590> either

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
fish that come into the hole are either

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.250 
fish that come into the hole are either
gonna<00:02:36.010> go<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.970> active<00:02:37.390> gig<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.110> they're

gonna go for the active gig or they're
gonna<00:02:38.380> go<00:02:38.560> for<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.800> one<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.010> not<00:02:39.220> as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
gonna go for the one that's not as

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.830 
gonna go for the one that's not as
active<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> very<00:02:40.330> good<00:02:40.510> bluegill
