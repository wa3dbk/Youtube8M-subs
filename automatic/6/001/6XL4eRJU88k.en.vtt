00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.369
 list of games that are available 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.580
 to do the tests to play for five 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.779

 download again and have this video there 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.290
 the description of the games that are 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.899
 available beauty is great novelty that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.420
 this same guy who is testing the beto 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.360
 said the following that now has a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.210
 card game rental service from 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.309
 seven days 14 days and 30 days 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 then this is a new modality that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.430
 you can get the eggs and the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.770
 games that apart from digital games 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.980
 this year than when you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 some game for a video game and now the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.579
 rent for that just the horizons 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.600
 video games, for example in some 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 games 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 I'll give a simple example January I want 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 That you were fast, you take a 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.930
 hour a little bit I think even less 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.729
 pleasure to the garden and you're done 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.350
 multiplayer has some themes but it's a game 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.570
 that you play once and ready 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
 This is a game that you can 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.380
 quietly stretch for seven days 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.549
 Cool move to call the keeper 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.830
 play and just ready 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.320
 already had this experience does not need 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.970
 buy the physical game and everything 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.310
 in some games and simply want to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.829
 to test to fascinate I will buy 30 days to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.299
 make you a 30-day seat because I 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.939
 I want to play online a little later 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.700
 Beauty, I do not know how long you last. 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.899
 playing the game there are people who take the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.399
 whole game 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.860
 the bad part is when more than 70 people 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.079
 who want to test multiple games then 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.909
 very cool this initiative I think 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.220
 It will really work for me, I think. 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.390
 this idea of renting games in the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.189
 internet has a future 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.369
 that many other hero you shirt 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.430
 no longer found on ovi.com.br for only 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.729
 40 reais and free shipping from two 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.729
 parts
