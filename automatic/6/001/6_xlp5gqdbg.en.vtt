too Apollo crews and tied dillinger

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.440 
too Apollo crews and tied dillinger
isn't<00:03:09.260> high<00:03:09.470> ranking<00:03:10.040> up<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:11.030> list<00:03:11.269> of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
isn't high ranking up on the the list of

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.809 
isn't high ranking up on the the list of

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
cards for the NXT takeover special but I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.309 
cards for the NXT takeover special but I
think<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.510> might<00:03:14.599> be<00:03:14.750> one<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.140> main

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
think it might be one of the main

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.050 
think it might be one of the main
matches<00:03:15.769> that<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:16.010> really<00:03:16.250> do<00:03:16.430> remember<00:03:16.819> when
