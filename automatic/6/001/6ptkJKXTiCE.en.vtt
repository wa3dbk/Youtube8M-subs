valve<00:02:32.360> close<00:02:32.960> it<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.620> then<00:02:34.100> pump<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.670> tire

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
valve close it and then pump the tire

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.350 
valve close it and then pump the tire
just<00:02:36.830> recommended<00:02:38.560> psi<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.610> pump<00:02:40.880> as<00:02:41.180> you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
just recommended psi on this pump as you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.950 
just recommended psi on this pump as you
can<00:02:41.510> see<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:42.140> has<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:45.520> gauge<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:47.600> tells<00:02:47.660> you

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
can see it has a gauge that tells you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.470 
can see it has a gauge that tells you
how<00:02:48.110> much<00:02:48.260> psi<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:51.130> inner<00:02:52.130> tube<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.850> if

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
how much psi is in the inner tube and if

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.820 
how much psi is in the inner tube and if
you<00:02:53.600> don't<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.290> those<00:02:54.380> best<00:02:54.650> thing

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
you don't have one of those best thing

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.980 
you don't have one of those best thing
to<00:02:54.860> do<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.310> get<00:02:56.060> an<00:02:56.150> external<00:02:56.420> one<00:02:56.660> from<00:02:56.840> your

the<00:03:45.719> French<00:03:45.959> valve<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.239> don't<00:03:48.389> have

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the French valve and if you don't have

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.119 
the French valve and if you don't have
one<00:03:48.719> is<00:03:48.840> kind<00:03:49.169> of<00:03:49.230> pumps<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.709> best<00:03:49.949> thing<00:03:50.099> to

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
one is kind of pumps the best thing to

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.300 
one is kind of pumps the best thing to
do<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.430> use<00:03:50.579> an<00:03:50.669> adapter<00:03:51.739> they<00:03:52.739> most<00:03:53.250> commonly

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
do is use an adapter they most commonly

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.369 
do is use an adapter they most commonly
come<00:03:53.699> in<00:03:53.819> brass<00:03:54.030> sometimes<00:03:54.780> plastic<00:03:55.230> or

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
come in brass sometimes plastic or

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.990 
come in brass sometimes plastic or
aluminum<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.689> French<00:03:57.959> valve<00:04:01.519> tip<00:04:02.519> first

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
aluminum so the French valve tip first

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.439 
aluminum so the French valve tip first
thing<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.389> is<00:04:03.689> open<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> up<00:04:08.299> here's<00:04:09.299> the

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
thing to do is open it up here's the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.080 
thing to do is open it up here's the
closed<00:04:09.689> position<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.439> just<00:04:11.040> closed<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.489> and

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
closed position I just closed it and

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.469 
closed position I just closed it and
here's<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> open<00:04:13.379> position<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.359> as

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
here's the open position so you see as

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.999 
here's the open position so you see as
it<00:04:15.509> moves<00:04:15.750> there<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.259> is<00:04:16.349> open<00:04:16.590> position

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
it moves there this is open position

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:26.110 
it moves there this is open position
next<00:04:17.849> thing<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.150> do<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.389> get<00:04:18.479> your<00:04:18.599> pump<00:04:18.870> on

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.290 

there<00:04:27.889> here's<00:04:28.889> the<00:04:29.159> open<00:04:29.699> position<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.180> this

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
there here's the open position on this

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.939 
there here's the open position on this
pump<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.599> pumps<00:04:30.840> out<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.259> opposite<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.800> the

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
pump this pumps out the opposite of the

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.480 
pump this pumps out the opposite of the
other<00:04:32.070> one<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:33.930> need<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.199> know<00:04:34.349> that<00:04:34.680> and

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
other one you just need to know that and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.399 
other one you just need to know that and
just<00:04:35.610> try<00:04:35.759> both<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.180> them<00:04:36.330> here's<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.139> closed

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
just try both of them here's a closed

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.760 
just try both of them here's a closed
position<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.630> then<00:04:39.630> just<00:04:39.659> pump<00:04:39.990> away<00:04:40.110> same

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
position and then just pump away same

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.360 
position and then just pump away same
thing<00:04:41.300> now<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.720> use<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> adapter<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.039> a<00:04:44.130> pump

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
thing now to use the adapter and a pump

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.649 
thing now to use the adapter and a pump
if<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:44.789> don't<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.090> one<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.270> these<00:04:45.360> kind<00:04:45.599> of

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
if you don't have one of these kind of

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.860 
if you don't have one of these kind of
pumps<00:04:45.930> or<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.199> French<00:04:46.620> valve<00:04:47.539> you<00:04:48.539> get<00:04:48.690> one<00:04:48.840> of

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
pumps or a French valve you get one of

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.310 
pumps or a French valve you get one of
these<00:04:48.960> adapters<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.870> once<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:51.960> have<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.229> in

very good one because it also has a

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.540 
very good one because it also has a
pressure<00:05:31.080> gauge<00:05:31.470> they're<00:05:31.860> showing<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.400> how

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
pressure gauge they're showing you how

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.550 
pressure gauge they're showing you how
much<00:05:32.700> pressure<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.180> got<00:05:34.520> first<00:05:35.520> thing<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.760> do

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.260 
take a long time on a lot of pumping
easily<00:06:04.440> maybe<00:06:04.680> a<00:06:04.830> hundred<00:06:05.010> pumps<00:06:05.490> for<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.180> to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
easily maybe a hundred pumps for you to

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.120 
easily maybe a hundred pumps for you to
get<00:06:06.419> the<00:06:06.539> right<00:06:06.840> pressure<00:06:07.620> because<00:06:08.010> they're

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
get the right pressure because they're

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.830 
get the right pressure because they're
so<00:06:08.280> small<00:06:08.690> compared<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.900> big<00:06:10.050> ones<00:06:11.840> it's

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
so small compared to the big ones it's

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.879 
so small compared to the big ones it's
not<00:06:12.960> that<00:06:13.110> great<00:06:13.260> because<00:06:13.410> they're<00:06:13.710> also

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
not that great because they're also

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.070 
not that great because they're also

down more on the smaller side now this

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:25.930 
down more on the smaller side now this
pump<00:06:59.730> can<00:06:59.760> be<00:06:59.880> used<00:07:00.180> for<00:07:01.220> American<00:07:02.220> valves
