00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
scent I actually really kind of like

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.020 
scent I actually really kind of like
this<00:02:59.980> scent<00:03:00.190> especially<00:03:00.549> when<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:00.760> applying

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
this scent especially when I'm applying

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.339 
this scent especially when I'm applying
it<00:03:01.269> it's<00:03:02.139> a<00:03:02.290> really<00:03:02.470> light<00:03:03.459> floral<00:03:04.349> fragrance

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.069 
it it's a really light floral fragrance
that<00:03:05.560> makes<00:03:05.799> sense<00:03:06.069> but<00:03:06.609> then<00:03:06.879> as<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.900> time

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
that makes sense but then as the time

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.780 
that makes sense but then as the time
goes<00:03:08.319> on<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.680> do<00:03:08.829> start<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.190> sort<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.489> get<00:03:09.670> that

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
goes on you do start to sort of get that

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.819 
goes on you do start to sort of get that
sunless<00:03:10.299> tanning<00:03:10.569> smell<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.440> again<00:03:11.709> that's

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
sunless tanning smell so again that's

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.289 
sunless tanning smell so again that's

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
that guys can see it does give a really

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.400 
that guys can see it does give a really
nice<00:05:11.220> deep<00:05:11.520> beautiful<00:05:11.970> bronze<00:05:12.240> but<00:05:12.900> it's<00:05:13.200> kind

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
nice deep beautiful bronze but it's kind

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.570 
nice deep beautiful bronze but it's kind
of<00:05:13.470> interesting<00:05:13.860> it's<00:05:14.190> probably<00:05:14.490> not

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
of interesting it's probably not

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.980 
of interesting it's probably not
something<00:05:14.760> I<00:05:15.000> would<00:05:15.150> notice<00:05:15.450> if<00:05:15.600> I<00:05:15.690> had<00:05:15.810> only

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
something I would notice if I had only

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.600 
something I would notice if I had only
used<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.440> self-tanner<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.070> no<00:05:17.190> other<00:05:17.370> self

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
used a self-tanner and no other self

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.790 
used a self-tanner and no other self
tanners<00:05:17.940> but<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:18.750> guys<00:05:18.870> know<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.200> have<00:05:19.560> tried

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
tanners but you guys know I I have tried

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.260 
tanners but you guys know I I have tried
these<00:05:19.919> two<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.130> do<00:05:20.400> really<00:05:20.730> like<00:05:20.910> these<00:05:21.120> two

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
these two I do really like these two

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.790 
these two I do really like these two
self<00:05:21.510> tanners<00:05:21.750> as<00:05:21.900> well<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.290> it's<00:05:22.620> funny

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
self tanners as well and it's funny

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.930 
self tanners as well and it's funny
because<00:05:22.950> they<00:05:23.100> all<00:05:23.310> kind<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.730> give<00:05:23.910> a

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
because they all kind of give a

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.960 
because they all kind of give a
different<00:05:24.270> color<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.230> this<00:05:25.860> gives<00:05:26.280> kind<00:05:26.850> of

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
different color so this gives kind of

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.690 
different color so this gives kind of
like<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.360> red<00:05:27.900> brown<00:05:28.290> tan<00:05:29.040> if<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.400> makes<00:05:29.610> sense

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
like a red brown tan if that makes sense

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.090 
like a red brown tan if that makes sense
and<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.570> don't<00:05:30.600> want<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.960> say<00:05:31.140> like<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.620> red<00:05:31.860> Brown

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
and I don't want to say like a red Brown

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.200 
and I don't want to say like a red Brown
because<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.550> makes<00:05:32.700> it<00:05:32.820> look<00:05:32.910> like<00:05:32.970> you're

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
because that makes it look like you're

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.940 
because that makes it look like you're
