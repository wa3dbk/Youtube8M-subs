00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.420
 one more video tutorial and for you who 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.410
 today our tutorial is how to improve 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 fully realize the performance of your 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.460
 computer then comparing a program 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.230
 with this program called the ice says 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 clineron 8 and I tested it on another 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.440
 computer, I have not tested it on my 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 I quite like it then they leave some 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 to other programs that make almost 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 same thing but this program does it 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.110
 the whole process it analyzes the files 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.120
 to be able to free up disk space between 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.000
 other things here then the program 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.370
 called ice said clemer 8 will be on the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.939
 description for downloads and download it there 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 the installation is super simple neither easy and 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.350
 After you run it will open this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.549
 screen that is now here so we have 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 some features 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.030
 here you can see on the cleaning tabs 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 and advanced cleaning and cleaning of the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 system and it does a defragmentation of the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.320
 disk ok then this program is well 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.030
 advanced is a free version but it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.280
 it's a ball show so we'll do it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:45.920
 common cleaning 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.920
 Let's scan and we'll wait, okay? 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.320
 so he selected the total files 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.310
 2 gigs 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.710
 it will not delete files are they are 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.810
 on your computer store music 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.869
 among other things he will not do 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.360
 none of it will delete files 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.610
 them unnecessary here then this 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.530
 program comparing you with cycling it 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.170
 leaves the cyclone behind 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.330
 so I really liked him and come on. 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.860
 test here now so we'll click 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.860
 to start cleaning 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.400
 he wants me to close google chrome 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.150
 to be able to pause as we explain 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.410
 here for him to close he will give me 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.820
 another option he will he is already cleaning 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.910
 fully their files 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.540
 unnecessary were automatically 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.590
 two gigas he then found others 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.350
 programs do not find this for sure. 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 He's going to make this clean and nifty. 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.390
 then that was found 5,918 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.120
 files have been removed and the total 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.170
 he gave me is 2 gb of free space 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.049
 now that it was released ok then we 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.930
 we have the advanced cleaning he does 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.950
 analyzes all the disks that are in your 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.910

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.060
