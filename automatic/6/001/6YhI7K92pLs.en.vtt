black plastic and the stainless steel

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
black plastic and the stainless steel
you<00:01:11.400> virtually<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.880> zero<00:01:12.090> rust<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you virtually get zero rust which is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.060 
you virtually get zero rust which is
great<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.170> these<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.590> intended<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> be

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
great because these are intended to be

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.910 
great because these are intended to be
used<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.490> extremely<00:01:15.240> harsh<00:01:15.600> conditions<00:01:15.920> or

used in extremely harsh conditions or

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
used in extremely harsh conditions or
racing<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:18.000> time<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.540> avoid<00:01:18.780> rust

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
racing and any time you can avoid rust

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.649

you're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.950> ensure<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> longevity<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you're going to ensure the longevity of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
you're going to ensure the longevity of
the<00:01:22.020> product<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.340> good

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the product and so that's a really good

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.679 
the product and so that's a really good
thing<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> rally<00:01:23.939> armor<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> gone

thing that rally armor is kind of gone
the<00:01:24.810> extra<00:01:24.840> mile<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.420> thought<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the extra mile and thought about the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.969 
the extra mile and thought about the
rust<00:01:27.930> prevention<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.439> these<00:01:28.560> things<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.799> think

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
rust prevention on these things I think

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
rust prevention on these things I think
that's<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.159> cool<00:01:29.490> next<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.150> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> show

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that's really cool next I want to show

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you is the mud flap itself now here you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
you is the mud flap itself now here you
can<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> faraway<00:01:35.729> view<00:01:36.090> from<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
can see it get a faraway view from it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
can see it get a faraway view from it
you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.380> cut<00:01:37.619> out
