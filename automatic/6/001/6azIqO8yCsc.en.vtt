very<00:01:53.399> very<00:01:53.700> flat<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> name<00:01:54.750> implies<00:01:54.890> it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
very very flat as the name implies it

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.060 
very very flat as the name implies it
really<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.610> retains<00:01:57.509> depth<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> icons<00:01:58.799> but

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really it retains depth to the icons but

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.910 
really it retains depth to the icons but
without<00:01:59.310> giving<00:01:59.820> them<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.210> too<00:02:00.479> many<00:02:00.920> sharp

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
without giving them a too many sharp

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
without giving them a too many sharp
characteristics<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.299> flat<00:02:03.659> thin

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
characteristics it's a very flat thin

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
characteristics it's a very flat thin
minimal<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> light<00:02:05.579> theme<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> device

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
minimal and light theme to the device

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.510 
minimal and light theme to the device
and<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.530> adds<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.829> lot<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.129> character

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and I think that adds a lot of character

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
and I think that adds a lot of character
to<00:02:08.550> iOS<00:02:09.119> which<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.750> think<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.050> was<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.319> of

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to iOS which I think it was kind of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.979 
to iOS which I think it was kind of
lacking<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:12.150> really<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
lacking and I really really do like this

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.520

favorite themes because I really like

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.979 
favorite themes because I really like
the<00:03:38.820> rather<00:03:39.510> dull<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.350> tone<00:03:40.890> down<00:03:41.220> themes

the rather dull and tone down themes

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.630 
the rather dull and tone down themes
something<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.140> understated<00:03:43.829> minimal<00:03:44.430> but

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
something that's understated minimal but

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.430 
something that's understated minimal but
still<00:03:44.850> slick<00:03:45.239> enough<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.720> make<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> look<00:03:46.170> nice

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
still slick enough to make it look nice

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.860 
still slick enough to make it look nice
and<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.010> what<00:03:47.160> pastel<00:03:47.579> is<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.030> me<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:48.810> I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
a really nice pastel color palette it's

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.640 
a really nice pastel color palette it's
very<00:03:53.579> very<00:03:53.880> bland<00:03:54.359> but<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.200> way<00:03:55.380> also

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
very very bland but in that way also

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.250 
very very bland but in that way also
very<00:03:56.160> sophisticated<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.750> really<00:03:58.019> really

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
very sophisticated and I really really

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.590 
very sophisticated and I really really
do<00:03:58.380> like<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.769> theme<00:03:59.010> now<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.430> icons<00:03:59.970> retain

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
do like this theme now the icons retain

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.900 
do like this theme now the icons retain
themselves<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.829> in<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.190> terms<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.609> the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
themselves in the in the terms of the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.180 
themselves in the in the terms of the
shape<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.390> icons<00:04:03.780> nothing<00:04:04.709> else<00:04:04.950> really

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
shape of the icons nothing else really

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.979 
shape of the icons nothing else really
changes<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.910> think<00:04:06.180> overall<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.780> this

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
changes but I think overall that this

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.080 
changes but I think overall that this
theme<00:04:07.709> looks<00:04:07.920> very<00:04:08.220> very<00:04:08.280> nice<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:08.970> would

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
theme looks very very nice and I would

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.789 
theme looks very very nice and I would
definitely<00:04:09.239> recommend<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:10.019> for<00:04:10.170> anybody<00:04:10.410> who

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
go this is Anila I think it looks very

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.559 
go this is Anila I think it looks very
nice<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:43.160> kind<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.520> combines<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
nice it kind of combines the the

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.480 
nice it kind of combines the the
Soulstice<00:04:45.080> look<00:04:45.349> as<00:04:45.500> well<00:04:45.680> as<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.860> flat<00:04:46.099> 7

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
Soulstice look as well as the flat 7

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.050 
Soulstice look as well as the flat 7
look<00:04:47.080> because<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.380> does<00:04:48.530> have<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.490> long

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
look because it does have the long

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.450 
look because it does have the long
shadow<00:04:50.419> effect<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:50.930> some<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.229> icons<00:04:51.460> but

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
shadow effect on some of the icons but

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.129 
shadow effect on some of the icons but
the<00:04:52.580> icons<00:04:53.030> are<00:04:53.150> actually<00:04:53.449> smaller<00:04:53.810> and

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
the icons are actually smaller and

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.020 
the icons are actually smaller and
flatter<00:04:54.560> overall<00:04:55.099> now<00:04:55.699> this<00:04:55.820> theme<00:04:56.000> is

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
flatter overall now this theme is

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.760 
flatter overall now this theme is
probably<00:04:56.479> my<00:04:56.720> favorite<00:04:56.750> out<00:04:57.229> of<00:04:57.259> this<00:04:57.530> whole

probably my favorite out of this whole

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.710 
probably my favorite out of this whole
bunch<00:04:57.979> and<00:04:58.250> again<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.639> available<00:04:59.060> in<00:04:59.180> cydia<00:04:59.389> so

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
a little bit awkward I know I actually

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.810 
a little bit awkward I know I actually
had<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.830> make<00:05:10.130> sure<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.610> wasn't

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.879 
had to make sure that I wasn't
downloading<00:05:11.389> some<00:05:11.599> sort<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.840> weird<00:05:12.050> mod<00:05:12.650> or

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
downloading some sort of weird mod or

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.520 
downloading some sort of weird mod or
patch<00:05:13.130> for<00:05:13.520> my<00:05:13.610> device<00:05:13.940> but<00:05:14.810> after<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:15.110> saw<00:05:15.349> some

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
patch for my device but after I saw some

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.080 
patch for my device but after I saw some
reviews<00:05:15.919> of<00:05:15.949> this<00:05:16.159> theme<00:05:16.460> or<00:05:16.759> some

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090

reviews of this theme or some
screenshots<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.229> theme<00:05:18.440> rather<00:05:18.680> online

I<00:05:19.370> actually<00:05:19.759> did<00:05:20.090> think<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:20.330> was<00:05:20.449> pretty

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
I actually did think that was pretty

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.480 
I actually did think that was pretty
interesting<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.349> I<00:05:21.409> decided<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.949> take<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.190> look

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
interesting so I decided to take a look

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.790 
interesting so I decided to take a look
now<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.389> theme<00:05:23.690> actually<00:05:24.349> is<00:05:24.560> very

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
now this theme actually is very

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.499 
now this theme actually is very
different<00:05:25.009> from<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.400> others<00:05:25.610> it's<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:26.180> very

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
different from the others it's a very

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.689 
different from the others it's a very
radical<00:05:26.750> theme<00:05:27.229> in<00:05:27.409> that<00:05:27.889> regard<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.370> it<00:05:28.580> is

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
radical theme in that regard that it is

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.800 
radical theme in that regard that it is
very<00:05:28.849> different<00:05:29.120> from<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.449> others<00:05:29.630> because

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
very different from the others because

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.260 
very different from the others because
this<00:05:30.110> brings<00:05:30.380> back<00:05:30.440> a<00:05:30.590> lot<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.130> details<00:05:31.550> no

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
this brings back a lot of the details no

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.420 
this brings back a lot of the details no
again<00:05:32.449> this<00:05:32.690> theme<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:32.960> also<00:05:33.380> pretty<00:05:33.620> flat<00:05:34.039> but

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
again this theme is also pretty flat but

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.360 
again this theme is also pretty flat but
doesn't<00:05:35.030> actually<00:05:35.860> take<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.039> minimal

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
doesn't actually take the minimal

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.649 
doesn't actually take the minimal
approach<00:05:37.639> of<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.909> other<00:05:38.060> themes<00:05:38.389> and

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
approach of the other themes and

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.390 
approach of the other themes and
actually<00:05:39.199> adds<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.560> lot<00:05:39.740> of<00:05:39.889> detail<00:05:40.219> to<00:05:40.370> the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
actually adds a lot of detail to the

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.209 
actually adds a lot of detail to the
icons<00:05:40.880> now<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.479> icon<00:05:41.870> in<00:05:42.139> space<00:05:42.500> blueberry<00:05:42.949> as

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
icons now the icon in space blueberry as

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.249 
icons now the icon in space blueberry as
well<00:05:43.430> as<00:05:43.550> in<00:05:43.669> Zanella<00:05:44.090> for<00:05:44.599> winterboard<00:05:44.930> is

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
well as in Zanella for winterboard is

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.290 
well as in Zanella for winterboard is
almost<00:05:45.500> exactly<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:46.039> same<00:05:46.159> so<00:05:46.940> I<00:05:46.969> think<00:05:47.090> that

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
almost exactly the same so I think that

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.730 
almost exactly the same so I think that
one<00:05:47.479> of<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.690> themes<00:05:47.870> took<00:05:48.110> inspiration<00:05:48.259> from

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
one of the themes took inspiration from

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.709 
one of the themes took inspiration from
the<00:05:49.009> other<00:05:49.159> in<00:05:49.430> terms<00:05:49.639> of<00:05:49.820> their<00:05:50.120> icon<00:05:50.539> design

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
the other in terms of their icon design

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.350 
the other in terms of their icon design
I<00:05:51.080> also<00:05:51.740> really<00:05:52.130> really<00:05:52.159> do<00:05:52.520> like<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.969> icon

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
I also really really do like the icon

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.029 
I also really really do like the icon
design<00:05:53.509> for<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:53.930> tumblr<00:05:54.259> application<00:05:54.860> I

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
design for the tumblr application I

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.709 
design for the tumblr application I
think<00:05:55.310> it<00:05:55.430> is<00:05:55.460> one<00:05:55.669> of<00:05:55.699> my<00:05:55.880> favorite<00:05:56.210> icons<00:05:56.570> for

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
think it is one of my favorite icons for

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.200 
think it is one of my favorite icons for
tumblr<00:05:57.020> that<00:05:57.199> I<00:05:57.229> have<00:05:57.409> ever<00:05:57.620> seen<00:05:58.030> and<00:05:59.030> I
