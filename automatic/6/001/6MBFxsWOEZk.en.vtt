 make the same stylus marking 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.580
 because I'm using my database 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.410
 cut like mold but who does not have 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.990
 base has to do the marking 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.610
 pen with these measures

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:58.030
 67 finishes constant on first chat 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.049
 on the role of parents is the rain but 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:08.349
 I ended up responding with the help of two 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:14.040
 fillets or the scissors or guillotine who 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:18.129
 You have to cut that part now. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:25.450
 we have a measurement of 16 centimeters and 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:27.010
 half length is not the width is 14 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:37.629
 5 centimeters 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:41.950

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:46.359
 markings with the aid of the ruler and 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.209
 2 le over the markings 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.569
 You will pass the stylus very lightly. 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:57.819
 it's not to cut just to score 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:00.280
 to facilitate folds put bensati 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.879
 up the mark and pass leslie 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.879
 stiletto 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.530
 So we already have the brands alone. 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.980

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:55.849
 the current is very practical I do not do 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:06.469
 idea is to pass from glue only to join the two 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:09.219
 was not based on the invitation already 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.219

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.819
 so now with the finalizations every 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.229
 one will make of your theme your 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.330
 preference 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:24.830
 I'm using the appliques from here. 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:27.229
 debt on his behalf with treadmills and 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:33.520

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.520
 burning according to what you want 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.150
 so the invitation was just to put the 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.490
 software is ready 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.410
