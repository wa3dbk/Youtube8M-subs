00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
minutes but that's only because I didn't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.869 
minutes but that's only because I didn't
know<00:02:51.480> where<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:51.720> gone<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.819> see

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
know where I was gone now as you can see

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.420

the<00:02:54.120> shine<00:02:54.330> spray<00:02:54.599> has<00:02:54.780> landed<00:02:55.319> over<00:02:56.190> where

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the shine spray has landed over where

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.009 
the shine spray has landed over where
normally<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.239> would<00:02:57.360> have<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.660> wait<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
normally you would have to wait for the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.920 
normally you would have to wait for the
boats<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:59.370> only<00:02:59.519> reason<00:02:59.670> I've<00:02:59.879> done<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.269> I

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
boats the only reason I've done this I

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.900 
boats the only reason I've done this I
should<00:03:01.319> have<00:03:01.379> explained<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:02.819> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
should have explained this but then the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.940 
should have explained this but then the
reason<00:03:03.180> I'm<00:03:03.390> doing<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:04.049> 100<00:03:04.410> coins<00:03:04.590> now<00:03:04.799> is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
reason I'm doing the 100 coins now is

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.190 
reason I'm doing the 100 coins now is
because<00:03:05.099> we<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.459> either<00:03:05.580> wait<00:03:05.910> now<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.989> wait

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
because we can either wait now or wait

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.289 
because we can either wait now or wait
until<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.500> later<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> game<00:03:08.160> when<00:03:09.120> you

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
