00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it becomes that mad mad mad lib a bit

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.869 
it becomes that mad mad mad lib a bit
thinner<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> first<00:00:50.489> things<00:00:50.579> we'll<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
thinner one of the first things we'll be

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
thinner one of the first things we'll be
doing<00:00:50.969> Cilic<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.620> gets

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
doing Cilic up is because it's gets

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.549 
doing Cilic up is because it's gets
dented<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> gets<00:00:54.300> pushed<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.170> starts

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
dented and it gets pushed out it starts

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.290 
dented and it gets pushed out it starts
to<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.800> hard<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.340> silver<00:00:56.730> actually<00:00:57.059> gets

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
to get hard the silver actually gets

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
to get hard the silver actually gets
hard<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.930> any<00:00:58.140> mission<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.559> kids<00:00:58.739> getting

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
hard like any mission with kids getting

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
hard like any mission with kids getting
moved<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> over<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
moved about so we take it over to the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
moved about so we take it over to the
fold<00:01:01.289> we'll<00:01:01.949> give<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.340> little<00:01:02.460> soft<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:02.879> by

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
fold we'll give it a little soft now by

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
fold we'll give it a little soft now by
putting<00:01:03.180> heat<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.870> softens<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> metal

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
putting heat on to it softens the metal

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
putting heat on to it softens the metal
and<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> gives<00:01:05.610> us<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> chance<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.150> start

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and it gives us a chance to start

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.390 
and it gives us a chance to start
working<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> pushing<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.070> bruises

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
working on it and pushing these bruises

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.670 
working on it and pushing these bruises
out<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.750> stakes<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> tools

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
out this will do with stakes and tools

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
out this will do with stakes and tools
that<00:01:10.799> we've<00:01:11.010> got<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> them<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.420> 100

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that we've got some of them go back 100

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.719 
that we've got some of them go back 100
or<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.049> years<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.100> we'll<00:01:14.310> use<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
or so years and that's what we'll use to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
or so years and that's what we'll use to
push<00:01:14.939> these<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:16.259> planish<00:01:16.979> them

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
push these out and then planish them

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.710 
push these out and then planish them
over<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> hammer<00:01:17.729> before<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> polisher

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
over with a hammer before the polisher

over with a hammer before the polisher
gets<00:01:19.320> hold<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> polish<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
