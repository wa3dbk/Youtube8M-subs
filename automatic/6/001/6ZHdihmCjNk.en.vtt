00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.090
 if not 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.680
 and I explain to you why, as regards 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.969
 that we meet the same standards of 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.980
 security and regulatory requirements 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.410
 that we have implemented today 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.590
 on the web but not in terms of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 accessibility the channel application 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.480
 mobile is installed on the device by 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.580
 therefore, access is different from 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.140
 a web application 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.899
 we have directly installed in the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.309
 device accessing the application and 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.350
 we would accede without needing to depend 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.500
 of a browser as in the case of the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 Web 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.880
 in the mobile channel we can do 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.500
 different types of operations although 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.690
 it's true that we can not do all the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.700
 that today are made on the web 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.470
 but this is so on purpose what 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.690
 we seek is to generate content 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.750
 adapted to the terminal that is simple 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.280
 that suits a peculiarity of the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.110
 device that is smaller with a 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.940
 smaller screen and that's why we have 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.520
 have to make an effort to adapt the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.710
 functionality that we show in the channel 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 mobile so we believe that in the channel 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.899
 mobile - it's more and we have to equip 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.009
 of the necessary functionalities for 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.899
 that customers can do the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.640
 most frequent operations of nothing 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.000
 would provide the mobile channel with a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.229
 high complexity that I would then do 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.420
 that customers will not operate with 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.830
 normality so we believe that the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.360
 operations that there have to be are the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.850
 that customers perform with greater 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.680
 often on our website for example in 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.080
 the consultation of balances movements 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.320
 transfers that are the operations 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.950
 most important when it comes to operating with 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.950
 direct ing 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.140
 and operate through the mobile channel is very 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.570
 simple what we seek is to direct and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280
 guide the client by facilitating 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.590
 the operations that are carried out in the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 day by day what we are looking for is that the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.070
 user experience be as 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.810
 simple possible making life easier 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.610
 to all customers so they can 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.070
 do the operations with much greater 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.119
 agility so they operate on the mobile 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.119
 too easy 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.550
 the ing applications are found 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.769
 available in the android market and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.790
 of them in this case in the apple store 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.980
 and in google play and in both cases they are 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.930
 Free applications are very 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 well valued and has a level of 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.580
 download some and elevated and are 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.709
 working very well for the rest of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.510
 customers who do not have this type of 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.880
 devices we have solutions 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.700
 alternatives as is a web application 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.280
 adapted for mobiles in this case for 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.080
 blackberry and nokia so they can 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.220
 access through the services of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.220
 ing direct mobile channel 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.300
 if customers can make suggestions 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.069
 of mobile channel through three ways 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.660
 main in this case we can 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.220
 analyze the comments that the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.470
 clients leave on social networks 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.760
 we have a mailbox within the application 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.400
 of suggestions in which the clients 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.620
 They actively leave us their suggestions and 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.349
 finally we analyze the comments 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 that are made in the market place and 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.760
 be it apple store or google play in the case 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.110
 of android to analyze possible 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.519
 improvements that arise in the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.040
 comments that customers leave us 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.260
 in fact we have made improvements in the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 application derived from the comments 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.190
 of users in some of these three 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.580
 mailboxes and have already been implemented with 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.580
 success 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.440
 yes
