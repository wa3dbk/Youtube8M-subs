00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.360
 the comrades his friend rafa aka the fai 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:12.690
 here we have another tutorial again this 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.450
 I will explain a little about the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.140
 friends scales 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.279
 As I am already buying a new chord 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.580
 many good videos happen to come out in 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.470
 that accordion and no more because it 's so much 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.720
 of fano I think they say I can not touch 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 in that because they are tone of the sun that does not 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.110
 It's not going to be the same, because here I have 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.960
 a picture 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.020
 that take that they build to good 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 well here so this picture I'm going to put the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 facebook and today I'll explain more or 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.940
 less what is it that means that these 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.690
 they left on a sun accordion 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 the scale of the sun is the same as the scale 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.180
 of fa and the scale of me if you were 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.010
 playing a chord of me or an accordion of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.130
 fa 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.880
 if you see here like this 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.800
 so accordion accordion sun of my 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.130
 those beings accordion is if you know in the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.350
 scale of the accordion sun the sun go away 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.760
 namely the scale of the results of the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 same footsteps but you do not chew 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.160
 you know it's not going to be called this is load 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.990
 of sun knew love scale of fa 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.330
 also here is mile face is going to 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.440
 call the scale of me if an accordion of 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.850
 Sun is known on the scale of two 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.320
 they will automatically know why 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.510
 the same in some footsteps than in one 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.820
 scale that the scale of B flat and the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.080
 scale of course in a chord 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.210
 fa and on an accordion of me and here in 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.440
 sun scale if you know the scale of 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.330
 fa 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.700
 the new phase cord will know the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.280
 scale of my flat an accordion of me it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.590
 they will know the scale of r 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.480
 is that photo I'm going to have here is 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.490
 in the link below 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.650
 palin for my facebook that was going to be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.570
 that picture to make them easier 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.210
 because there are many people who ask 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.870
 I have some laces this under order 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 Then buy a band accordion and 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.650
 I'm doubting that if the footprints are 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.900
 the same things are exactly 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.740
 equal in each portion if they know a 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 scale of this in the tone more 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.810
 cities rather that scale or more than 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.240
 it's going to be obviously different tone 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.900
 now this scale today just like right now 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.620
 let's go a video we go in the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.620
 It is full of stones 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.800
 so 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.230
 it is here it is in the sun 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:49.230
 what turns huge column is also 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.230
 more expensive but they are the same 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.830
 and let's go 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.709
 with that kind of this one 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.300
 meats 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.300
 you are dad 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.060
 And p 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.769
 chord is not in this tone of it 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.620
 sun scale because it's running is 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.910
 in fa that scale the same footprints 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.260
 magically it is going to scale is going to 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.260
 name de facto scale 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.880
 the scale of two 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.910
 I looked back from here to not 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.170
 confuse them 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 I'm here like that 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.980
 scale of gift 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.359
 for me 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:22.169
 the scale of two were learned is 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.080
 here and this is an order from the sun and this 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.539
 It is a scale of two 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.539
 which scales automatically rocks 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.520
 come on let's take your time brothers 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.340
 take your time look here is you are 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.250
 the red cape makes the dona scale 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.949
 the sun reached the scale of blinding us with 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.960
 the pnv to that same scale and based on 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.740
 scale we decided to get to an accordion of 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.390
 me that scale based the scale of the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.160
 and friends 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.480
 and then the same will come for the scale 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:02.450
 of Fa they are understanding the 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.450
 concept to what today we are going to be here 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.860
 scale of fingers 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.860
 what song can be here my true 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.100
 and 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.100
 d 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.330
 but I could not 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.680
 do not 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.230
 that was on accordion scale of the sun is 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.230
 warm 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.880
 now now gift 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.250
 this funk accordion 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.790
 that same scale is not going to be 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.180
 around is going to be the scale of yes 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.180
 flat 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.250
 the scale of our red 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.800
 but here I like to compose the last 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.800
 where a voice 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.920
 and 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.220
 that's why 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.150
 apart from power 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.639
 for me 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.690
 a was 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.330
 was a little bit of information about 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.460
 the friends scales and if you have a 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.840
 accordion of zorita and want to buy a 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.900
 accordion of fa but in comparison to 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.330
 lace me a string of I do not know what x 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.689
 tone 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.069
 this one if you know on the scale I would say 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.479
 that is the main scale that more or 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:09.840
 minus all the simple entities 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:09.840
 they start with this scale to be here like this 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.990
 like me 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.800
 on those scales to the scale roughly 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.170
 the one that everyone starts because 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.910
 they always start and I started there all 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.560
 a majority start there 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.970
 so if you know that scale in 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.500
 any agreement even if they grab is going to 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.910
 be the same will sound a little to sound 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.070
 different obviously because it's another tone 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:42.770
 but the floors are going to be the same 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.380
 friends ok that has a sun crown and 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:49.580
 that in comparison to please me I do not know 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:53.300
 hurry the footsteps are the same and all 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.890
 the rate everything is equal we can step 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:00.190
 and so 

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:03.190
 and I hope that this seaweed has understood me 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.529
 have understood my point and perhaps the 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.939
 today 

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:09.479
 and so good friends here is everything 

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:11.300
 comrade rafael the next video with a 

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:14.349
 tutorial 

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.349
 maybe friends
