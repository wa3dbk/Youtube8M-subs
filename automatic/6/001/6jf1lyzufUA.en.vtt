00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
strange move pawn to a6 but it's very

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.290 
strange move pawn to a6 but it's very
flexible<00:00:29.910> move<00:00:30.449> basically<00:00:30.869> black<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.650> waiting

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
flexible move basically black is waiting

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.319 
flexible move basically black is waiting
to<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:34.440> white<00:00:34.710> does<00:00:35.010> before<00:00:35.610> committing

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
to see what white does before committing

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
to see what white does before committing
his<00:00:36.450> pawns<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> center<00:00:37.380> he<00:00:37.530> might<00:00:37.800> play<00:00:37.980> e6

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
his pawns in the center he might play e6

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.690 
his pawns in the center he might play e6
might<00:00:39.360> play<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.870> 5<00:00:40.200> sometimes<00:00:41.070> might<00:00:41.250> even<00:00:41.489> play

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
might play a 5 sometimes might even play

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
might play a 5 sometimes might even play
g6<00:00:42.390> depending<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:44.030> white<00:00:45.079> plays<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.379> his

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
g6 depending on how white plays with his

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.090 
g6 depending on how white plays with his
pieces<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.860> most

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
pieces so I'm going to look at the most

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.660 
pieces so I'm going to look at the most
critical<00:00:50.879> move<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.289> that's<00:00:55.289> Bishop<00:00:55.860> g5<00:00:56.340> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
critical move and that's Bishop g5 in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
critical move and that's Bishop g5 in
this<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.180> clip<00:00:58.309> now<00:00:59.309> black<00:00:59.699> has<00:01:00.170> many

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this first clip now black has many

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
this first clip now black has many
different<00:01:01.379> systems<00:01:01.800> against<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:04.820> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
different systems against this but I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.330 
different systems against this but I
should<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.600> point<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:07.909> but<00:01:10.159> 97<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
should just point out but 97 is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
should just point out but 97 is
currently<00:01:11.820> quite<00:01:12.060> popular<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:15.180> idea

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
currently quite popular with the idea

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.859 
currently quite popular with the idea
that's<00:01:15.869> after<00:01:16.170> f4<00:01:18.710> Queen<00:01:19.710> c7<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:21.659> with

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that's after f4 Queen c7 and then with

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
that's after f4 Queen c7 and then with
this<00:01:22.100> curious<00:01:23.100> idea<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.290> giving<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.890> porn

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this curious idea of giving up a porn

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.870 
this curious idea of giving up a porn
with<00:01:26.939> g5<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.799> worth<00:01:29.250> watching<00:01:29.490> out

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
with g5 now this is worth watching out

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.080 
with g5 now this is worth watching out
for<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.659> pawn<00:01:31.020> sacrifice<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:32.090> a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
for because this pawn sacrifice is a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.260 
for because this pawn sacrifice is a
very<00:01:33.630> common<00:01:34.049> idea<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> night<00:01:35.189> off<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
very common idea in the night off the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.240 
very common idea in the night off the
idea<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.290> by<00:01:39.799> exchanging<00:01:40.799> off<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> porn

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
idea is that by exchanging off the porn

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.569 
idea is that by exchanging off the porn
f4<00:01:41.820> black<00:01:42.390> wins<00:01:42.659> control<00:01:43.229> over<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> e5<00:01:44.310> square

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
f4 black wins control over the e5 square

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.249 
f4 black wins control over the e5 square
so<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:47.640> usually<00:01:48.329> things<00:01:48.570> continuing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so this is how usually things continuing

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.219 
so this is how usually things continuing
and<00:01:49.439> after<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.100> should<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.310> 395<00:01:51.299> although

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and after we should be 395 although

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.770 
and after we should be 395 although

safe in the mid of the board but it's
probably<00:03:18.030> better<00:03:18.570> for<00:03:18.750> white<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.320> try<00:03:19.560> castles
