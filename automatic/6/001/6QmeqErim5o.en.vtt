00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 little friends today's book is the ocean 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.109
 at the end of the road that is a book 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 he liked it a lot and by the way he won the prize 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.090
 to the best fantasy book in goodreads 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.849
 this year the story begins when the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.460
 narrator leaves a funeral and said some 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.470
 words at the funeral and has a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 free time before having to meet 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 with all those people again for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.730
 drink tea and stuff then this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 subject when leaving the funeral instead of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
 go directly to the meeting 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.550
 it deviates from the road and goes to the house where 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 the small video near your house 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 there was a pond in a pond 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
 ducks he goes straight to her 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.710
 he sits in a place he finds by 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 there and he starts to remember things about his 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.670
 childhood and that is the story that he 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 is counting on the novel for example you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.610
 account of when he turned seven 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.140
 his mom organized a party to which 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 no one was also aware when a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.010
 miner arrives at his house and runs over his 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.989
 kitten to which I wanted very clear the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.359
 miner is good people and gives him another 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 cat but it's a cat that I do not know 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.010
 He is well and he does not like it very much 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.570
 so 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.720
 in short this miner one day I grabbed the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.110
 daddy's car commits suicide they find the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.590
 car near the road with the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.210
 money inside drowned by the gas of 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 escape with a hose 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 you know how not to end the joke is that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.780
 there he finds in the car with the body 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.890
 of the miner inside and a comic that was 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.640
 for the child this and suddenly it is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.890

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.409
 takes the child not to his house and they pass 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.390
 there is a time with him and from there 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.130
 strange things start in this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.770
 book suddenly people started him 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.679
 to spend things with coins or money 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.750
 in a very strange way to people them 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.720
 They winnowed who know where coins 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.700
 they went out and things like that on one of those days 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.320
 the child has a nightmare and when 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.070
 wakes up has a golden coin in the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.230
 throat wakes up almost drowning 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.720
 when you pull out the coin you have blood and 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.790
 things so well ugly and tells you I told them 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.510
 Nestor the led and James Turk lives with his 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.470
 mom and her grandmother and they look like 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.140
 know what is happening 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.920
 because he says no yes I think it's like that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.880
 it must be and well says good 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.760
 I'm going to fix the problem 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.610
 right now I come and the boy says he hears you 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.740
 I can accompany and the two go by the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.980
 forest walking and they meet with a 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.520
 thing made of super large canvas 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.140
 who speaks or seems to speak or something like that and 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.000
 so I told him this that starts 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.010
 discuss with this crop of canvas 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.690
 gigantic and leads to line seized from 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.360
 your hand and he says you're not going to sit 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.720
 but in one of those the thing made of 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.430
 canvas like that throws something and the child gets 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.160
 sit in my hand I got to grab 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.730
 that throws the wool crop 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.470
 and feel a sting in the foot because I was going 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.150
 barefoot I think good to jog that the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.090
 style starts talking to the thing 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.750
 giant chaderon in a strange language 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.040
 a strange language good because that happens 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.690
 come back and the child goes home very 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 happy that it's all over and blah 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.360
 but there is one thing that happens after what 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.940
 what happens next is that picket 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.480
 child was a worm got a worm 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.340
 at the foot and he sees it and starts to take it out 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.870
 go to the bathroom to give some tweezers and company ' 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.660
 roll the worm inside the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.810
 foot the description in that part is to me 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.060
 gave me a lot of things I do not know and good what 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.180
 What happens next is that a new 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.250
 nanny to take care of the child who is the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.300
 narrator and his little sister and is a nanny 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.940
 very pretty and everything but there is a problem the 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.770
 problem is that I can not tell you which one 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.080
 is the problem because that would be a 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.840
 spoiler but that's when the story 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.250
 start to grasp as one more sense 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.320
 fanciful and all that the way in which 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.940
 it is written is father because in the end 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.230
 is the story as you will tell it 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.450
 child not as sitel to count the adult 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.989
 who is remembering but what language is 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.609
 very easy as a child because and that the 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.229
 child also has many complaints about 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.359
 of the adult world that if they put you to 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.250
 think a little bit not when you describe us 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.199
 something like troll to see if to me yes 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.720
 I was afraid that I do not know why it is not 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.699
 like a horror book if I do 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.169
 It was scary or maybe I'm a scared 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.630
 I know but it 's like a fantasy book 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.430
 in oviedo or at least that was the prize 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.990
 who won in good woods the story is 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.090
 very good the truth has turns that to me 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.530
 They surprised me a lot and the best thing is 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.110
 that the characters take it as well 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.050
 natural is like that how this happened 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.729
 the other did not and you stay like that 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.919
 that he thinks something that I also liked 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.900
 is that the narrator is telling you his 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.660
 memories but as if I were 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.729
 remembering at the time I do not know if I 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.320
 I explain the narrator is telling you his 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.570
 childhood when he was seven and 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.330
 then he tells you how the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.210
 things like he saw things 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.860
 in a very innocent way then it is 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.780
 saying as well as what or if this happened and 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.849
 Now that I'm big and you thought about it 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.639
 better than what such a thing meant and 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.740
 Well, that's what I have to say 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.409
 about this book is very good 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.000
 truth read no good that 's all for the 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.800
 video is not not true is not all for 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.569
 Today I am going to recommend the channel 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.469
 merit by line towers I leave the link 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.909

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:31.550

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.379
 have a very happy new year 2014 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.469
