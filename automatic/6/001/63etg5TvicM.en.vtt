00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.140 

well<00:00:03.090> what<00:00:03.330> I'm<00:00:03.449> saying<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.440> general

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
well what I'm saying is that in general

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.089 
well what I'm saying is that in general
you<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.359> condition<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.080> players<00:00:07.379> while

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
you can condition your players while

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.690 
you can condition your players while
they're<00:00:08.940> playing<00:00:09.120> football<00:00:10.070> because<00:00:11.070> if<00:00:11.340> if

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
they're playing football because if if

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.970 
they're playing football because if if
you<00:00:11.940> play<00:00:12.179> games<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.049> example<00:00:13.440> four<00:00:13.620> versus

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
you play games for example four versus

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670 
you play games for example four versus
four<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.210> play<00:00:15.450> 12<00:00:15.780> games<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.379> minute

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
four and you play 12 games of one minute

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.519 
four and you play 12 games of one minute
and<00:00:17.029> at<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.270> stage<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.810> players<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.350> two

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and at one stage the players have two

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.679 
and at one stage the players have two
minutes<00:00:19.830> rest<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> certain<00:00:20.880> stage<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
minutes rest and at a certain stage a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.359 
minutes rest and at a certain stage a
few<00:00:22.050> months<00:00:22.320> later<00:00:22.470> they<00:00:22.800> only<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.160> one

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
few months later they only have one

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.939 
few months later they only have one
minute<00:00:23.519> rest<00:00:23.880> then<00:00:24.779> basically<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.800> do

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
minute rest then basically what you do

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279 
minute rest then basically what you do
is<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.550> players<00:00:26.789> are<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.060> playing<00:00:27.449> but

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
is that the players are just playing but

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
is that the players are just playing but
in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> meantime<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.910> bodies<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> player

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
in the meantime the bodies of the player

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.569 
in the meantime the bodies of the player
have<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> deal<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> fact<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
have to deal with the fact that there is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.150 
have to deal with the fact that there is
less<00:00:32.850> rest<00:00:33.180> between<00:00:33.510> football<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> body

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
less rest between football so the body

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.720 
less rest between football so the body
will<00:00:35.460> learn<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.510> recover<00:00:36.870> more<00:00:37.110> quickly<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
will learn to recover more quickly and

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.280 
will learn to recover more quickly and
ultimately<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> game<00:00:39.270> players<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:40.020> able

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
ultimately in the game players are able

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
ultimately in the game players are able
to<00:00:40.320> recover<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.920> quickly<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.340> make<00:00:41.579> more

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to recover more quickly and make more

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.459 
to recover more quickly and make more
actions<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> play<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> higher<00:00:44.010> intensity

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
actions and play with a higher intensity

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
actions and play with a higher intensity
so<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.620> general<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.370> condition<00:00:47.879> your

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so in general you can condition your

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
so in general you can condition your
place<00:00:48.620> while<00:00:49.620> they're<00:00:49.800> playing<00:00:49.950> football

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
place while they're playing football

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
place while they're playing football
of<00:00:51.120> course<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> worked<00:00:51.629> at<00:00:51.780> Barcelona<00:00:52.350> also

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
of course you worked at Barcelona also

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
of course you worked at Barcelona also
Raymond<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> Frank<00:00:54.000> Rijkaard<00:00:54.420> tell<00:00:54.809> us<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
Raymond and the Frank Rijkaard tell us a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
Raymond and the Frank Rijkaard tell us a
bit<00:00:55.079> about<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.440> project<00:00:55.649> they're<00:00:56.210> basically

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bit about your project they're basically

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.650 
bit about your project they're basically
what<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.480> did<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.840> developed<00:00:59.210> let's<00:01:00.210> let's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
what we did was we developed let's let's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
what we did was we developed let's let's
say<00:01:00.809> long-term<00:01:01.440> fitness<00:01:01.910> because<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
say long-term fitness because a lot of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.109 
say long-term fitness because a lot of
coaches<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.809> precision<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.339> focused<00:01:05.760> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
coaches in precision are so focused on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.270 
coaches in precision are so focused on
fitness<00:01:06.659> training<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
fitness training that they do a lot of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
fitness training that they do a lot of
fitness<00:01:08.580> training<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.330> short<00:01:09.750> period<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
fitness training in a short period of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.030 
fitness training in a short period of
time<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.479> clear<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
time and it's very clear in in the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
time and it's very clear in in the
physiological<00:01:14.700> science<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
physiological science that if you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.950 
physiological science that if you
develop<00:01:16.619> Fitness<00:01:17.100> quickly<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.420> reality

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
develop Fitness quickly that in reality

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
develop Fitness quickly that in reality
you<00:01:19.439> develop<00:01:20.100> short-term<00:01:20.700> fitness<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you develop short-term fitness and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.200 
you develop short-term fitness and
that's<00:01:22.170> why<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.830> lot<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> football<00:01:23.490> players<00:01:23.670> at

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that's why a lot of football players at

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.570 
that's why a lot of football players at
the<00:01:24.299> end<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> season<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.110> breaking<00:01:25.500> down

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the end of the season are breaking down

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
the end of the season are breaking down
because<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:27.240> has<00:01:27.420> been<00:01:27.560> developed

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
because there has been developed

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.920 
because there has been developed
short-term<00:01:29.070> fitness<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.450> did<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> we

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
short-term fitness so what we did is we

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.980 
short-term fitness so what we did is we
develop<00:01:31.710> long<00:01:31.920> term<00:01:31.950> fitness<00:01:32.549> by<00:01:32.990> gradually

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
develop long term fitness by gradually

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230 
develop long term fitness by gradually
develop<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> fitness<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> players<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.090> at

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
develop the fitness of the players so at

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.490 
develop the fitness of the players so at
the<00:01:36.360> end<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> season<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.290> still

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the end of the season there was still

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340 
the end of the season there was still
very<00:01:37.680> fit<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> say<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
very fit so what would you say then if I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
very fit so what would you say then if I
told<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> majority<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> youth<00:01:42.000> coaches

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
told you that majority of youth coaches

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.219 
told you that majority of youth coaches
in<00:01:42.600> Australia<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.380> spend<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.950> least<00:01:44.720> 10<00:01:45.720> 15

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
in Australia will spend at least 10 15

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.800 
in Australia will spend at least 10 15
minutes<00:01:46.530> maybe<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.130> maybe<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.520> third<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.149> many

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
minutes maybe more maybe a third of many

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.230 
minutes maybe more maybe a third of many
of<00:01:48.960> their<00:01:49.110> sessions<00:01:49.610> doing<00:01:50.610> fitness<00:01:51.030> work

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
of their sessions doing fitness work

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.060 
of their sessions doing fitness work
which<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.840> no<00:01:52.020> relevance<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> football

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
which has no relevance to football

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.149 
which has no relevance to football
running<00:01:53.280> around<00:01:53.490> cones<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.240> flags<00:01:54.710> after<00:01:55.710> 10

years even at the highest level my
experience<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.719> fitness<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.960> never<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
experience is that fitness is never the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.490 
experience is that fitness is never the
difference<00:02:02.040> between<00:02:02.250> levels<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.060> play<00:02:03.500> it's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
difference between levels of play it's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
difference between levels of play it's
the<00:02:04.619> football<00:02:04.950> skill<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> makes<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the football skill that makes a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.309 
the football skill that makes a
difference<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.049> speed<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.710> actions<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
difference the speed of your actions the

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.449 
difference the speed of your actions the
your<00:02:10.319> knowledge<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> game<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.430> game

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
your knowledge of the game your game

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.059 
your knowledge of the game your game
inside<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
inside that

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.610 
inside that
at<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> end<00:02:13.579> of<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> day<00:02:13.909> your<00:02:14.120> technique

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
at the end of the day your technique

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.830 
at the end of the day your technique
decides<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:15.920> you're<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.099> good<00:02:16.310> player<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.840> if

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
decides if you're a good player and if

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.140 
decides if you're a good player and if
you're<00:02:18.079> a<00:02:18.139> good<00:02:18.319> player<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.670> next<00:02:19.939> step

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you're a good player then the next step

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.330 
you're a good player then the next step
is<00:02:20.329> that<00:02:20.359> you<00:02:20.719> try<00:02:21.139> to<00:02:21.170> make<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.859> good<00:02:22.069> player

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
is that you try to make this good player

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.819 
is that you try to make this good player
as<00:02:22.639> fit<00:02:22.909> as<00:02:23.120> possible<00:02:23.290> but<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.469> the

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
as fit as possible but that's the

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.910 
as fit as possible but that's the
perspective<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.760> fitness<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:27.439> what<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.739> see

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
perspective of fitness and what you see

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.099 
perspective of fitness and what you see
now<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.579> people<00:02:29.150> start<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:29.780> fitness

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
now is that people start with fitness

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.500 
now is that people start with fitness
and<00:02:30.319> they<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.489> fit<00:02:31.879> player<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.480> a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
and they think that a fit player is a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.330 
and they think that a fit player is a
better<00:02:32.780> player<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.290> that's<00:02:34.189> a

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
better player and that's a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.610 
better player and that's a
misunderstanding<00:02:34.609> I<00:02:35.569> think<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.379> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
misunderstanding I think it's the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.860 
misunderstanding I think it's the
tactical<00:02:37.189> insight<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.329> technique<00:02:38.750> of

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
tactical insight and the technique of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.470 
tactical insight and the technique of
players<00:02:39.200> at<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.219> end<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.579> day<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.969> makes

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
players at the end of the day that makes

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.580 
players at the end of the day that makes
the<00:02:41.659> difference<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.510> youth<00:02:45.049> problem

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the difference so the youth problem

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.500 
the difference so the youth problem
should<00:02:45.799> be<00:02:45.859> based<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.549> those<00:02:46.700> principles<00:02:46.939> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
should be based on those principles the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.259 
should be based on those principles the
players<00:02:48.169> in<00:02:48.469> Australia<00:02:49.010> should<00:02:49.669> be<00:02:49.819> developed

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
players in Australia should be developed

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.129 
players in Australia should be developed
in<00:02:50.359> a<00:02:50.419> technical<00:02:50.959> way<00:02:51.109> in<00:02:51.349> a<00:02:51.409> tactical<00:02:51.769> way<00:02:52.159> and

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
in a technical way in a tactical way and

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.110 
in a technical way in a tactical way and
when<00:02:54.139> you<00:02:54.290> do<00:02:54.439> that<00:02:54.469> you<00:02:55.250> will<00:02:55.609> get<00:02:55.819> better

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
when you do that you will get better

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.929 
when you do that you will get better
players<00:02:56.449> and<00:02:56.750> at<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.919> certain<00:02:58.310> age<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.730> want

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
players and at the certain age you want

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.059 
players and at the certain age you want
those<00:02:59.359> players<00:02:59.659> also<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.169> be<00:03:00.409> as<00:03:00.590> fit<00:03:00.889> as

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
those players also to be as fit as

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.809 
those players also to be as fit as
possible<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.699> then<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:03.829> can<00:03:04.040> also<00:03:04.219> make<00:03:04.400> use

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
possible and then you can also make use

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.089 
possible and then you can also make use
of<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:05.449> brilliant<00:03:06.049> knowledge<00:03:06.379> in<00:03:06.650> Australia

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
of the brilliant knowledge in Australia

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.369 
of the brilliant knowledge in Australia
because<00:03:07.719> everybody<00:03:08.719> in<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.959> world<00:03:09.139> knows

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
because everybody in the world knows

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.740 
because everybody in the world knows
that<00:03:09.680> Australia<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.519> one<00:03:11.419> of<00:03:11.659> the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
that Australia is one of the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.250 
that Australia is one of the
frontrunners<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:13.400> terms<00:03:13.699> of<00:03:13.939> knowledge<00:03:14.780> in

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
frontrunners in terms of knowledge in

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.530 
frontrunners in terms of knowledge in
strength<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:15.980> conditioning<00:03:16.400> but<00:03:17.120> if<00:03:17.329> you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
strength and conditioning but if you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.229 
strength and conditioning but if you
look<00:03:17.720> at<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.959> from<00:03:18.139> that<00:03:18.319> perspective<00:03:18.500> then

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
look at it from that perspective then

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.699 
look at it from that perspective then
football<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.509> reference<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.199> strength

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
football is the reference and strength

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.710 
football is the reference and strength
and<00:03:21.919> conditioning<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.609> part<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.479> that

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
and conditioning is part of that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.249 
and conditioning is part of that
reference<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.349> like<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.340> said<00:03:25.669> before<00:03:26.109> if<00:03:27.109> I

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:27.259 
reference and like I said before if I

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.599 
reference and like I said before if I
look<00:03:27.409> at<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.620> right<00:03:27.799> now<00:03:28.009> then<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.579> a

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
look at it right now then you have a

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.520 
look at it right now then you have a
football<00:03:29.030> reference<00:03:29.419> and<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:30.079> strength<00:03:30.349> and

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
football reference and a strength and

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.740 
football reference and a strength and
conditioning<00:03:30.979> reference<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.609> sometimes<00:03:32.090> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
conditioning reference and sometimes the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.629 
conditioning reference and sometimes the
strength<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.229> conditioning<00:03:33.709> coach<00:03:33.919> is<00:03:34.310> even

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
strength and conditioning coach is even

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.849 
strength and conditioning coach is even
in<00:03:34.759> charge<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.900> football<00:03:36.199> reference<00:03:36.560> so

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
in charge of the football reference so

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.429 
in charge of the football reference so
the<00:03:37.790> challenge<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.389> think<00:03:38.449> in<00:03:38.720> Australia<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.409> to

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
the challenge I think in Australia is to

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.469 
the challenge I think in Australia is to
put<00:03:39.829> things<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.459> little<00:03:40.579> bit<00:03:40.819> more<00:03:40.879> into<00:03:41.449> a

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
put things a little bit more into a

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.780 
put things a little bit more into a
football<00:03:41.900> perspective<00:03:42.650> one<00:03:43.489> thing<00:03:43.639> about

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
football perspective one thing about

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.599 
football perspective one thing about
Australians<00:03:44.419> is<00:03:44.659> we<00:03:45.560> like<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.889> theory<00:03:46.280> but<00:03:46.459> we

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
Australians is we like the theory but we

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.999 
Australians is we like the theory but we
would<00:03:47.060> like<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.269> see<00:03:47.540> results<00:03:48.019> we<00:03:48.379> like<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.709> say

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.009 
would like to see results we like to say

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.089 
would like to see results we like to say
that<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.459> has<00:03:49.639> worked<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.509> record<00:03:50.870> that

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
that it has worked you record that

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.259 
that it has worked you record that
professional<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.220> international<00:03:52.699> level<00:03:53.000> is

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
professional and international level is

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.759 
professional and international level is
beyond<00:03:53.629> question<00:03:53.870> what<00:03:54.290> about<00:03:54.470> at<00:03:54.590> youth

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
beyond question what about at youth

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.439 
beyond question what about at youth

level then I understand that you worked
with<00:03:56.719> Feyenoord<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.590> took<00:03:57.739> over<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:58.009> whole

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
with Feyenoord you took over the whole

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.039 
with Feyenoord you took over the whole
youth<00:03:58.459> program<00:03:58.939> tell<00:03:59.239> us<00:03:59.329> about<00:03:59.479> the<00:03:59.629> results

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
youth program tell us about the results

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.729 
youth program tell us about the results
yeah<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:01.250> was<00:04:01.669> I<00:04:02.090> was<00:04:02.239> brought<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.229> find<00:04:03.560> out

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
yeah I was I was brought to to find out

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.999 
yeah I was I was brought to to find out
in<00:04:03.859> 2006<00:04:04.519> because<00:04:04.969> I<00:04:05.540> always<00:04:06.290> say<00:04:06.650> as<00:04:06.859> a<00:04:06.889> joke

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:07.009 
in 2006 because I always say as a joke

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.839 
in 2006 because I always say as a joke
that<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:08.599> final<00:04:08.989> juice<00:04:09.169> system<00:04:09.620> was<00:04:09.849> well

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
that the final juice system was well

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.429 
that the final juice system was well
known<00:04:11.180> all<00:04:11.509> over<00:04:11.539> the<00:04:11.870> world<00:04:12.079> for<00:04:12.289> not

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
known all over the world for not

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.979 
known all over the world for not
producing<00:04:12.650> first<00:04:13.219> in<00:04:13.430> place<00:04:13.639> and<00:04:13.969> of<00:04:14.750> course

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
producing first in place and of course

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.310 
producing first in place and of course
that's<00:04:15.169> a<00:04:15.560> little<00:04:15.709> bit<00:04:16.130> cynical<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:17.389> that's

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
that's a little bit cynical but that's

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.129 
that's a little bit cynical but that's
the<00:04:18.440> way<00:04:18.530> people<00:04:18.560> look<00:04:19.009> at<00:04:19.159> it<00:04:19.280> in<00:04:19.549> Holland<00:04:20.139> so

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
the way people look at it in Holland so

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.360 
the way people look at it in Holland so
they<00:04:22.010> brought<00:04:22.279> me<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.639> and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
they brought me in and

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.629 
they brought me in and
they<00:04:24.060> wanted<00:04:24.990> me<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.650> all<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.130> other<00:04:26.250> people

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
they wanted me and all the other people

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.210 
they wanted me and all the other people
in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.419> youth<00:04:27.570> department<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.979> change

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
in the youth department to to change

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.460 
in the youth department to to change
that<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.729> so<00:04:30.510> what<00:04:30.810> we<00:04:30.930> did<00:04:31.080> was<00:04:31.290> we

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
that and so what we did was we

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.730 
that and so what we did was we
introduced<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.910> football<00:04:33.660> philosophy<00:04:33.900> into

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
introduced this football philosophy into

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.520 
introduced this football philosophy into
the<00:04:34.889> youth<00:04:35.070> system<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.610> manhood<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:37.080> went<00:04:37.320> from

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the youth system of manhood we went from

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.830 
the youth system of manhood we went from
six<00:04:37.979> training<00:04:38.400> sessions<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:39.030> week<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.540> four

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
six training sessions a week to four

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.140 
six training sessions a week to four
training<00:04:40.110> sessions<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.620> week<00:04:40.650> so<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.699> focus

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
training sessions a week so the focus

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.110 
training sessions a week so the focus
was<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.330> quality<00:04:43.160> which<00:04:44.160> means<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.639> players

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
was on quality which means that players

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.540 
was on quality which means that players
were<00:04:45.300> only<00:04:45.449> training<00:04:45.840> once<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.440> day<00:04:46.620> instead<00:04:47.430> of

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
were only training once a day instead of

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.640 
were only training once a day instead of
twice<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.120> day<00:04:48.389> sometimes<00:04:48.660> because<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.440> was

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
twice a day sometimes because that was

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.260 
twice a day sometimes because that was
that<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.100> what<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.370> did<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.760> past

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that is what they did in the past

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.990 
that is what they did in the past
so<00:04:51.870> only<00:04:52.229> one<00:04:52.440> training<00:04:52.740> session<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.370> day<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:53.910> a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
so only one training session a day in a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.779 
so only one training session a day in a
free<00:04:54.240> day<00:04:54.449> in<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.900> middle<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.320> youth<00:04:55.789> and

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
free day in the middle of the youth and

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.610 
free day in the middle of the youth and
therefore<00:04:57.240> we<00:04:57.389> created<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.930> situation<00:04:58.590> that

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
therefore we created a situation that

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.270 
therefore we created a situation that
players<00:04:59.010> were<00:04:59.690> rested<00:05:00.690> when<00:05:01.650> they<00:05:01.800> started

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
players were rested when they started

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.210 
players were rested when they started
each<00:05:02.600> new<00:05:03.600> training<00:05:04.050> session<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:04.919> each

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
each new training session so each

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.779 
each new training session so each
training<00:05:05.699> session<00:05:05.850> was<00:05:06.270> at<00:05:06.539> 100%<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:08.430> we<00:05:08.580> got<00:05:08.760> a

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
training session was at 100% so we got a

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.969 
training session was at 100% so we got a
lot<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.120> intensity<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.020> lot<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.289> quality<00:05:10.770> in

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
lot of intensity and a lot of quality in

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.120 
lot of intensity and a lot of quality in
all<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.370> those<00:05:11.520> four<00:05:11.850> sessions<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:13.130> basically

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
all of those four sessions and basically

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.620 
all of those four sessions and basically
what<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.550> players<00:05:14.880> did<00:05:15.060> was<00:05:15.270> they<00:05:15.479> only

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
what the players did was they only

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.990 
what the players did was they only
played<00:05:15.930> football<00:05:16.199> for<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.070> whole<00:05:17.340> training

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
played football for the whole training

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.810 
played football for the whole training
session<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:18.900> there<00:05:19.139> was<00:05:19.289> no<00:05:19.820> strength

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
session so there was no strength

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.779 
session so there was no strength
training<00:05:21.690> there<00:05:22.560> was<00:05:22.680> no<00:05:22.889> separate

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
training there was no separate

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.330 
training there was no separate
conditioning<00:05:24.479> training<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.949> other<00:05:26.100> thing

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
conditioning training the other thing

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.860 
conditioning training the other thing
that<00:05:26.370> we<00:05:26.760> skipped<00:05:27.090> was<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.479> static

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
that we skipped was the static

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.040 
that we skipped was the static
stretching<00:05:28.320> because<00:05:28.860> in<00:05:29.520> literature<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.570> can

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
stretching because in literature you can

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.050 
stretching because in literature you can
see<00:05:31.410> that<00:05:31.620> there<00:05:32.099> is<00:05:32.190> no<00:05:32.400> relationship

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
see that there is no relationship

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.480 
see that there is no relationship
between<00:05:33.470> static<00:05:34.470> stretching<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.160> injury

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
between static stretching and injury

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.250 
between static stretching and injury
prevention<00:05:35.720> because<00:05:36.720> that's<00:05:36.930> what<00:05:37.080> people

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
prevention because that's what people

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.640 
prevention because that's what people
say<00:05:37.590> you<00:05:37.860> have<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.700> stretch<00:05:38.940> statically<00:05:39.650> to

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
say you have to stretch statically to

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.390 
say you have to stretch statically to
prevent<00:05:41.039> injury<00:05:41.810> well<00:05:42.810> if<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.979> look<00:05:44.160> at<00:05:44.280> the

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
prevent injury well if you look at the

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.060 
prevent injury well if you look at the
literature<00:05:44.610> there<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.300> not<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.510> single<00:05:46.110> study

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
literature there is not a single study

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.790 
literature there is not a single study
that<00:05:47.220> has<00:05:47.729> proven<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:49.880> hypothesis<00:05:51.650> so<00:05:52.650> we

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
that has proven this hypothesis so we

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.770 
that has proven this hypothesis so we
skipped<00:05:53.099> all<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.370> static<00:05:53.699> stretching<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.210> by

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
skipped all the static stretching and by

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.589 
skipped all the static stretching and by
doing<00:05:55.139> that<00:05:55.260> you<00:05:55.500> win<00:05:55.770> another<00:05:56.729> five<00:05:57.150> or<00:05:57.419> ten

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
doing that you win another five or ten

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.920 
doing that you win another five or ten
minutes<00:05:57.960> football<00:05:58.800> time<00:05:59.360> so<00:06:00.360> basically<00:06:00.720> what

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
minutes football time so basically what
