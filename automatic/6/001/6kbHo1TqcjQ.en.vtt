00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 hi all well my name deal and I'm 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.179
 here to help you traveling 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 talk about my experience 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.540
 That's right. I came here in December. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.480
 2012 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.810
 I am now in 2014 in July in 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.269
 It's good to start by December in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.029
 December you have to bring two 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.949
 jackets if it is up to the knee 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.969
 better still invest in coats 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.350
 heavy 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.629
 That 's right and third dragon is up 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 you do not want to draw too much attention 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 that impression belongs to us all 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.700
 looking at me works in the colors 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.030
 black and brown because when you walk 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:56.210
 on the street are the things you most see 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 are black clothes dark clothes bring 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 boot in sneakers and a slipper for you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.900
 stay in the house so bring 2 house 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:16.170
 My tip is a blue coat. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:18.689
 braga is also lightweight or those mine 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.240
 thicker pants for you to wear 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.759
 second skin because in places 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 closed as restaurants theaters 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.810
 cinema in heater 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.430
 so always have a second skin for 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 under a shirt 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.700
 here or here as I am to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 You withdraw your wedding put on the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.220
 chair has place that has cat you have 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 hard to feel more comfortable because otherwise 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.990
 You'll be cold 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.040
 I was going to have a lot of people talking about snow 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.380
 so I need to put three blouses on 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.689
 please do not exaggerate much in the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.570
 down is a tip but it is not every 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.939
 person 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.179
 well this is the cold tip 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:13.230
 then both male and female 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:20.159

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:23.069

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.739
 a thermal underwear and a blazer 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.010
 one more thermal outfit that gives you 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.560
 stay the assembly places enclosed right 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.709

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.689
 July is a month I'm now is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:43.290
 very hot much heat in blouses a 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:46.650
 Bermuda skirt and pants 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.139
 It's okay you come here and buy it because 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.730
 missed is very cheap depending on the place 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:55.879
 if it's not cheap it's cheap 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.870
 Bring basic clothes of color bra 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.540

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.849
 she feels more at ease 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.159
 The cool thing is that this summer is only dark. 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.349
 at nine o'clock at night 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.189
 so if you have too much tourism to do in 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.479
 City 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:18.629
 a tip is you get to know a place where 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:22.229
 You'll eat, I'll catch the train knowing how. 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.709

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:37.530

 and in the summer this is what we already knew 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.370
 A lot of summer does not have much secrecy.
