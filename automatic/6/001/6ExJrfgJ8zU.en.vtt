quality barbecue because triggers are
very<00:02:07.799> popular<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> competition<00:02:08.879> circuit

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
very popular on the competition circuit

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.870 
very popular on the competition circuit
with<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.350> triggers<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:10.890> come<00:02:11.100> out<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:11.850> you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
with the triggers you come out now you

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.610 
with the triggers you come out now you
turn<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> dial<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.660> smoke<00:02:13.050> setting

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
turn the dial to the smoke setting

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
turn the dial to the smoke setting
I<00:02:13.650> give<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> five<00:02:14.370> minutes<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> start

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I give that five minutes when you start

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
I give that five minutes when you start
to<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> smoke<00:02:16.320> roll<00:02:16.590> out<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.860> there<00:02:17.010> turn

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
to see the smoke roll out of there turn

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
to see the smoke roll out of there turn
the<00:02:17.700> dial<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.450> temperature<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the dial to the temperature that you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.160 
the dial to the temperature that you
want<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.700> wait<00:02:21.480> about<00:02:21.570> five<00:02:21.900> minutes

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
want that's it wait about five minutes

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.660 
want that's it wait about five minutes
so<00:02:22.410> it'll<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.920> temperature<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.580> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
so it'll be to that temperature and you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.040 
so it'll be to that temperature and you
can<00:02:23.700> tell<00:02:24.030> because<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.360> has<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.630> electronic

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
can tell because it has an electronic

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.650 
can tell because it has an electronic
readout<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.670> models<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
readout on the models with the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
readout on the models with the
electronic<00:02:28.110> thermostat<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:29.070> trigger<00:02:29.310> does

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
electronic thermostat what trigger does

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.670 
electronic thermostat what trigger does
is<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.910> starts<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.690> fire<00:02:30.900> down<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.380> bottom

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
is it starts the fire down on the bottom

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680 
is it starts the fire down on the bottom
of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> grill<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> fire<00:02:32.400> pot<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.570> has

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
of the grill on the fire pot and it has

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.000 
of the grill on the fire pot and it has
a<00:02:33.720> couple<00:02:33.930> deflectors<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.740> create<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
a couple deflectors that create a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.550 
a couple deflectors that create a
convection<00:02:35.490> action<00:02:35.970> inside<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.540> grill<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.440> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
convection action inside the grill so it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.350 
convection action inside the grill so it
cooks<00:02:37.770> evenly<00:02:38.130> side<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.610> side<00:02:38.790> front<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.120> back

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
cooks evenly side to side front to back

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.960 
cooks evenly side to side front to back
and<00:02:39.630> top<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.230> bottom<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.340> even<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.760> don't

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and top to bottom it's so even you don't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.480 
and top to bottom it's so even you don't
even<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.450> flip<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:42.870> food<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.340> if

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
even have to flip your food you can if

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.710 
even have to flip your food you can if
you<00:02:44.580> want<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.060> want<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.300> grill<00:02:45.540> marks

you want to if you want the grill marks

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.150 
you want to if you want the grill marks

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
and low temperature settings they'll

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.810 
and low temperature settings they'll
burn<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.470> rate<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.680> about<00:04:04.950> two<00:04:05.340> pounds<00:04:05.580> an

the<00:04:40.110> elements<00:04:40.350> another<00:04:41.130> part<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.640> great

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
the elements another part with the great

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.800 
the elements another part with the great
ease<00:04:42.480> of<00:04:42.510> clean<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.920> they<00:04:44.160> have<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.820> drip<00:04:45.600> tray

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
ease of clean is they have a drip tray

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.330 
ease of clean is they have a drip tray
in<00:04:46.020> there<00:04:46.200> where<00:04:46.380> all<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.650> grease<00:04:46.890> will<00:04:47.130> run

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
in there where all the grease will run

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.970 
in there where all the grease will run
on<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.880> run<00:04:48.150> off<00:04:48.330> into<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:49.110> little<00:04:49.350> drip<00:04:49.560> bucket
