it<00:02:32.810> really<00:02:33.350> easily<00:02:33.709> same<00:02:34.550> thing<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.270> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it really easily same thing that you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.780 
it really easily same thing that you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
everything in proportion first if it's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.830 
everything in proportion first if it's
not<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.340> proportion<00:02:43.519> just<00:02:43.910> make<00:02:44.269> sure<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.660> is

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
not in proportion just make sure it is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.949 
not in proportion just make sure it is
and<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.650> once<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.870> would

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
and what once it is then you would

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.040 
and what once it is then you would
continue<00:02:48.200> drawing<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:50.120> more<00:02:50.420> into<00:02:50.600> detail

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
continue drawing like more into detail

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.330 
continue drawing like more into detail
like<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.500> Pens<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.910> arms<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.800> head<00:02:54.830> and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
like the Pens the arms the head and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.630 
like the Pens the arms the head and
detail<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.769> would<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:57.950> all<00:02:58.340> gather

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
detail and then it would just all gather

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.710 
detail and then it would just all gather
up<00:02:58.940> into<00:02:59.269> one<00:02:59.540> fold<00:03:00.410> figure<00:03:00.890> drawing<00:03:01.720> another

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
up into one fold figure drawing another

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.570 
up into one fold figure drawing another
thing<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.260> better<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.860> review<00:03:04.220> as<00:03:04.430> to
