00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
going into the tournament first they

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
going into the tournament first they
will<00:00:43.020> differ<00:00:43.260> slightly<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.980> more<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> an

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
will differ slightly a bit more of an

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
will differ slightly a bit more of an
