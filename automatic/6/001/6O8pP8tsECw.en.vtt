we have a couple investors back over

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.679 
we have a couple investors back over
here<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.640> we'll<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:23.939> how<00:00:23.970> those<00:00:24.269> investors

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
counteract those stores general sitting

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280 
counteract those stores general sitting
on<00:00:31.160> fourth<00:00:32.160> floors<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:33.120> sitting<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.630> 5<00:00:33.870> Thor's

now<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> also<00:00:35.040> using<00:00:35.460> medevacs<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.090> pick<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
now and also using medevacs to pick up a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
now and also using medevacs to pick up a
couple<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.899> those<00:00:36.989> stores<00:00:37.320> Thor's<00:00:37.920> are

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
couple of those stores Thor's are

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
couple of those stores Thor's are
however<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.730> upgraded<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
however are not upgraded and that really

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
however are not upgraded and that really
is<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.559> shame<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.520> does<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.760> fact<00:00:41.879> take<00:00:42.329> an

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is a shame as it does in fact take an

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.529 
is a shame as it does in fact take an
army<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.899> build<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> Thor<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.040> why<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.180> might<00:00:45.390> as

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
army to build a Thor so why you might as

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.040 
army to build a Thor so why you might as
well<00:00:45.750> start<00:00:46.079> upgrading<00:00:46.649> those<00:00:47.100> units<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.520> well

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
well start upgrading those units as well

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.540 
well start upgrading those units as well

ahead<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.690> neural<00:02:12.960> parasite<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> those

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
ahead and neural parasite one of those

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
ahead and neural parasite one of those
units<00:02:14.040> unable<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.790> deal<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.180> once<00:02:15.360> again

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
units unable to deal with once again

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
units unable to deal with once again
neural<00:02:15.810> parasite<00:02:15.930> another<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
neural parasite another that is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.500 
neural parasite another that is
definitely<00:02:17.430> longer<00:02:17.730> than<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> range<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.450> three

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
definitely longer than a range of three

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.650 
definitely longer than a range of three
so<00:02:19.290> able<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.740> grab<00:02:20.160> two<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.580> those<00:02:20.700> stores<00:02:21.060> door

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
so able to grab two of those stores door

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.150 
so able to grab two of those stores door
is<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:21.930> continuing<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> fight<00:02:22.680> back<00:02:22.920> not

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
is now continuing the fight back not

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.740 
is now continuing the fight back not
using<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.460> 250<00:02:23.970> millimeter<00:02:24.330> strike<00:02:24.540> count

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
using that 250 millimeter strike count

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.750 
using that 250 millimeter strike count
him<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.350> would<00:02:25.500> essentially<00:02:26.010> stop<00:02:26.490> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
him as that would essentially stop to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.370 
him as that would essentially stop to
all<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:27.180> those<00:02:27.270> units<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.020> two<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> those

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
all of those units so two of those

all of those units so two of those
investors<00:02:28.830> now<00:02:29.010> quickly<00:02:29.280> taking<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.790> more

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
investors now quickly taking out more

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.580 
investors now quickly taking out more
units<00:02:30.600> continuing<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.080> fight<00:02:31.260> these

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
units continuing to fight these

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.500 
units continuing to fight these
investors<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.250> however<00:02:32.640> are<00:02:32.880> far<00:02:33.150> enough<00:02:33.270> away

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
investors on however are far enough away

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.710 
investors on however are far enough away
did<00:02:34.140> not<00:02:34.320> it'd<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.980> easy<00:02:35.250> targets<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.360> Roche<00:02:36.570> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
did not it'd be easy targets so Roche is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.060 
did not it'd be easy targets so Roche is
now<00:02:36.840> coming<00:02:37.080> back<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.740> be<00:02:37.800> able<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
now coming back and going to be able to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.830 
now coming back and going to be able to
take<00:02:38.220> down<00:02:38.370> these<00:02:38.490> two<00:02:38.700> doors<00:02:39.000> trying<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.660> take

goes so able to reclaim one of those

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.690 
goes so able to reclaim one of those
doors<00:02:45.480> maybe<00:02:45.959> if<00:02:46.380> he<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.709> uses<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.130> 250

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
for general general could have gone

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.960 
for general general could have gone
ahead<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.860> done<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.280> same<00:03:26.430> thing<00:03:26.489> as<00:03:26.760> well
