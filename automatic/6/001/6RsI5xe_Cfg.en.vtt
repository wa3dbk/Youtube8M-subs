00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
entirely too long and then that the main

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.260 
entirely too long and then that the main
reason<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.129> there's<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.150> whole

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
aming the servers so you could either do

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
aming the servers so you could either do
one<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.349> two<00:02:16.470> things<00:02:16.590> either<00:02:17.340> waited<00:02:17.849> out<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
one of two things either waited out a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.050 
one of two things either waited out a
couple<00:02:18.360> days<00:02:18.660> until<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.709> know<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.880> big

couple days until you know that the big
rush<00:02:21.360> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.380> slows<00:02:22.860> down<00:02:23.099> or<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.940> could

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
rush kind of slows down or you could

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.150 
rush kind of slows down or you could
wait<00:02:24.239> let<00:02:24.930> us<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:25.319> long<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> takes<00:02:25.830> for
