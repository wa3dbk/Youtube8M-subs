have<00:03:38.590> been<00:03:38.709> my<00:03:38.860> choice<00:03:39.130> for<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.489> film<00:03:39.700> Seth

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
have been my choice for this film Seth

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.030 
have been my choice for this film Seth
MacFarlane<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.350> reason<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.680> picked<00:03:41.860> him

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
MacFarlane and the reason I picked him

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.710 
MacFarlane and the reason I picked him
in<00:03:42.519> particular<00:03:43.030> not<00:03:43.150> only<00:03:43.209> because<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.569> think

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
in particular not only because I think

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.300 
in particular not only because I think
he<00:03:43.780> does<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> good<00:03:44.140> job<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.500> pushing<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.220> edge

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
he does a good job of pushing the edge

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.370 
he does a good job of pushing the edge
of<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.489> envelope<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.600> knowing<00:03:46.840> where<00:03:46.959> comedy

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
of the envelope and knowing where comedy

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.380 
of the envelope and knowing where comedy
is<00:03:47.500> going<00:03:47.830> rather<00:03:48.040> than<00:03:48.190> where<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.459> been<00:03:48.730> but

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
is going rather than where it's been but

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.790 
is going rather than where it's been but
because<00:03:49.630> there's<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:49.930> fight<00:03:50.230> scene<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.560> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
because there's this fight scene in the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.229 
because there's this fight scene in the
film<00:03:50.950> like<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.250> fantasy<00:03:51.550> fight<00:03:51.880> scene<00:03:52.120> between

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
film like a fantasy fight scene between

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.420 
film like a fantasy fight scene between
Ben<00:03:52.569> Stiller<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:52.959> Adam<00:03:53.170> Scott<00:03:53.319> that<00:03:54.040> reminded

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
Ben Stiller and Adam Scott that reminded

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.539 
Ben Stiller and Adam Scott that reminded
me<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:54.550> much<00:03:54.850> of<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.269> scene<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.570> Family<00:03:55.989> Guy

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
me so much of the scene in Family Guy

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.520 
me so much of the scene in Family Guy
where<00:03:57.549> Peter<00:03:58.269> Griffin<00:03:58.630> fights<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.140> chicken

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
where Peter Griffin fights that chicken

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.259 
where Peter Griffin fights that chicken
and<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.280> was<00:04:00.400> just<00:04:00.549> like<00:04:00.670> that<00:04:00.850> was<00:04:00.940> done<00:04:01.090> better

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and I was just like that was done better

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.150 
and I was just like that was done better
there<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:02.260> movie<00:04:02.530> really<00:04:02.620> does<00:04:02.860> rely<00:04:03.130> on

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
there and this movie really does rely on

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.280 
there and this movie really does rely on
non<00:04:03.430> sequiturs<00:04:03.910> because<00:04:04.239> obviously<00:04:04.420> it's<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
non sequiturs because obviously it's the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.870 
non sequiturs because obviously it's the
whole<00:04:05.440> Walter<00:04:05.769> Mitty<00:04:05.950> going<00:04:06.250> into<00:04:06.519> having<00:04:06.790> a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
whole Walter Mitty going into having a

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.870 
whole Walter Mitty going into having a
dream<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.630> fantasy<00:04:07.959> escape<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.370> Family<00:04:09.850> Guy

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
dream a fantasy escape and Family Guy

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.330 
dream a fantasy escape and Family Guy
just<00:04:10.180> does<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.350> weekly<00:04:11.709> basis<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.250> a

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
just does that on a weekly basis in a

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.210 
just does that on a weekly basis in a
better<00:04:12.910> fashion<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:14.560> know<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.799> funnier

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
better fashion and you know it's funnier

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.800 
better fashion and you know it's funnier
and<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.579> think<00:04:15.820> you<00:04:16.209> know<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.570> dirtily

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
and I think you know it's dirtily

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.539 
and I think you know it's dirtily
funnier<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.289> I<00:04:17.350> think<00:04:17.560> Seth<00:04:18.160> MacFarlane

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
funnier and I think Seth MacFarlane

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.830 
funnier and I think Seth MacFarlane
would<00:04:18.789> have<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> capacity<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.479> go<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> little

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
would have the capacity to go a little

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.219 
would have the capacity to go a little
bit<00:04:20.049> deeper<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:22.690> was<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.020> was<00:04:23.140> my

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
bit deeper so that was that was my

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.570 
bit deeper so that was that was my
biggest<00:04:23.470> problem<00:04:23.860> with<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.039> movie<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.310> mean<00:04:24.490> it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
biggest problem with the movie I mean it

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.330 
biggest problem with the movie I mean it
is<00:04:24.729> visually<00:04:25.270> stunning<00:04:25.410> but<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.710> think<00:04:27.039> alike

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
is visually stunning but I think alike

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.430 
is visually stunning but I think alike
it<00:04:27.580> borrows<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> lot<00:04:28.360> from<00:04:28.419> being<00:04:28.960> able<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.229> show

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
it borrows a lot from being able to show

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.070 
it borrows a lot from being able to show
great<00:04:29.710> photos<00:04:30.100> from<00:04:30.280> Life<00:04:30.460> magazine<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.539> all

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
great photos from Life magazine and all

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.450 
great photos from Life magazine and all
of<00:04:32.260> which<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.560> think<00:04:32.590> are<00:04:32.860> more<00:04:33.130> compelling

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
of which I think are more compelling

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.040 
of which I think are more compelling
than<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.729> lot<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.090> shots<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.419> Ben<00:04:34.690> Stiller

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
than a lot of the shots that Ben Stiller

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.159 
than a lot of the shots that Ben Stiller
has<00:04:35.169> set<00:04:35.410> up<00:04:36.120> also<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.600> takes<00:04:37.840> place<00:04:37.960> in

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
has set up also this takes place in

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.659 
has set up also this takes place in
modern<00:04:38.320> day<00:04:38.680> but<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.070> had<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.220> very<00:04:39.400> vintage

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
modern day but it had a very vintage

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.190 
modern day but it had a very vintage
feel<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.270> particularly<00:04:40.539> in<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.870> beginning

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
feel to it particularly in the beginning

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.630 
feel to it particularly in the beginning
of<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.380> movie<00:04:41.590> which<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:41.800> found<00:04:42.010> distracting

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
of the movie which I found distracting

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.790 
of the movie which I found distracting
although<00:04:43.240> not<00:04:43.479> nearly<00:04:43.660> as<00:04:43.840> distracting<00:04:44.530> as

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
although not nearly as distracting as

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.529 
although not nearly as distracting as
some<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.250> crazy<00:04:45.550> product<00:04:45.940> placement<00:04:46.479> in

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
some of the crazy product placement in

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.390 
some of the crazy product placement in
this<00:04:46.630> movie<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.169> haven't<00:04:47.830> seen<00:04:48.039> crazy<00:04:48.250> I

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
this movie I haven't seen crazy I

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.890 
this movie I haven't seen crazy I
haven't<00:04:48.700> seen<00:04:48.880> blatant<00:04:49.210> product<00:04:49.419> placement

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
haven't seen blatant product placement

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.420 
haven't seen blatant product placement
like<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.140> in<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.289> long<00:04:50.440> time<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.100> was<00:04:51.280> really

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
like that in a long time so I was really

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.190 
like that in a long time so I was really
surprised<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:51.970> see<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.180> here<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.840> started

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
surprised to see it here and it started

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.659 
surprised to see it here and it started
out<00:04:53.289> kind<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.560> endearing<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.130> as<00:04:54.190> his<00:04:54.430> joke

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
out kind of endearing and as his joke

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.100 
out kind of endearing and as his joke
but<00:04:55.210> then<00:04:55.360> by<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.600> time<00:04:55.780> they<00:04:55.930> got<00:04:56.050> to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
but then by the time they got to

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.890 
but then by the time they got to

you just can't get the money from
somewhere<00:05:01.330> else<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:03.400> thing<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.820> impressed

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
somewhere else the thing that impressed

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.159
