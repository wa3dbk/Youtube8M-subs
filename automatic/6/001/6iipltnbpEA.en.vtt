the back corners here here's a piece of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.190 
the back corners here here's a piece of
one<00:00:43.969> just<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.270> there<00:00:45.539> were<00:00:45.660> two<00:00:45.899> pieces

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
one just then there were two pieces

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
one just then there were two pieces
squared<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> corners<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.329> hide<00:00:48.539> the

pipes in everything what have you and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.970 
pipes in everything what have you and
basically<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.489> silicones<00:00:54.030> cut<00:00:54.329> off<00:00:54.980> but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
basically all the silicones cut off but

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.139 
basically all the silicones cut off but
I<00:00:56.190> still<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:57.000> residue<00:00:57.870> marks<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.920> glass

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149

the<00:01:28.049> scrap<00:01:28.380> piece<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.650> glass<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.490> been

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the scrap piece of glass and it's been

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.679 
the scrap piece of glass and it's been
on<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.210> hours<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.659> hasn't

it<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.149> there's<00:02:00.630> nothing<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> can't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it all there's nothing there you can't

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
it all there's nothing there you can't
feel<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.310> nail<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:03.000> finger

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.760 
feel it with your nail or your finger
it's<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:05.180> dirty<00:02:06.180> water<00:02:07.079> mark<00:02:07.500> that

won't come off
you<00:02:11.060> can<00:02:11.239> see<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.540> over<00:02:11.690> here<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.709> I've<00:02:12.860> got

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
you can see it over here and I've got

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.030 
you can see it over here and I've got
that<00:02:13.250> on<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.000> foot<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.599> looks<00:02:14.659> worse<00:02:15.140> with<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
that on the foot it looks worse with the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.789 
that on the foot it looks worse with the
tank<00:02:16.280> empty<00:02:16.760> when<00:02:17.150> it's<00:02:17.330> full<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.170> water<00:02:18.349> you

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
tank empty when it's full of water you

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.640 
tank empty when it's full of water you
can<00:02:19.159> still<00:02:19.340> notice<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:21.110> half<00:02:21.409> as

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
can still notice it but it's not half as

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.089 
can still notice it but it's not half as
bad<00:02:21.920> obviously<00:02:22.730> I've<00:02:23.060> got<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.569> same<00:02:23.920> down<00:02:24.920> in

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
bad obviously I've got the same down in

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.640 
bad obviously I've got the same down in
this<00:02:25.280> corner<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:25.849> well<00:02:26.260> running<00:02:27.260> all<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> way

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
this corner as well running all the way

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.220 
this corner as well running all the way
along<00:02:27.890> here<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.489> inside<00:02:28.959> also<00:02:29.959> there<00:02:30.140> I'm

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
along here on the inside also there I'm

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.750 
along here on the inside also there I'm
not<00:02:30.349> worried<00:02:30.590> about<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.950> side<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.610> my

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
not worried about the side because my

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.039 
not worried about the side because my
background<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.269> going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.569> covering<00:02:32.959> that

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
background is going to be covering that

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.420 
background is going to be covering that
but<00:02:33.260> I'd<00:02:33.349> like<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.739> off<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.670> front<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:37.250> and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
but I'd like it off the front here and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.509 
but I'd like it off the front here and
here<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> basically<00:02:39.260> I've<00:02:39.920> tried<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
here so basically I've tried on the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.520 
here so basically I've tried on the
scrap<00:02:40.790> piece<00:02:41.060> for<00:02:41.450> two<00:02:41.599> hours<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.230> says

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
scrap piece for two hours it says

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.309 
scrap piece for two hours it says
minimum<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.459> two<00:02:43.970> hours<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.540> leave<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.019> set

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
minimum of two hours to leave it to set

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.819 
minimum of two hours to leave it to set
to<00:02:46.010> remove<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> silicon<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.840> hasn't<00:02:48.109> done

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
to remove the silicon and it hasn't done

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.449 
to remove the silicon and it hasn't done
anything<00:02:49.129> that<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.519> can<00:02:49.790> see<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:51.040> I'm<00:02:52.040> going<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
anything that I can see and I'm going to

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.979 
anything that I can see and I'm going to
put<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> bit<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.180> tank<00:02:53.450> now<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:55.750> see<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
put a bit on the tank now and see if it

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.390 
put a bit on the tank now and see if it
does<00:02:57.200> anything<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:59.030> don't<00:02:59.810> think<00:03:00.400> it's

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
does anything but I don't think it's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.910 
does anything but I don't think it's
going<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.700> do<00:03:01.819> anything<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.359> be<00:03:02.450> honest<00:03:02.920> we
