pretty<00:00:35.579> easy<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.970> find<00:00:36.180> they're<00:00:36.600> usually

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
pretty easy to find they're usually

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
pretty easy to find they're usually
relatively<00:00:37.500> inexpensive<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.519> you<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.820> find

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
relatively inexpensive when you do find

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
wheels sometimes they come with the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.099 
wheels sometimes they come with the
blower<00:00:52.769> sometimes<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.609> don't<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.780> anyway

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
they're big and heavy a lot of times you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
they're big and heavy a lot of times you
can<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.710> nothing<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.309> you'll<00:00:59.519> just

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
can get them for nothing if you'll just

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.189

that way I don't have to worry about the
blower<00:01:11.450> because<00:01:12.450> they're<00:01:12.660> not<00:01:12.810> making<00:01:12.990> any

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

this<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:24.990> sander<00:01:25.620> I<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.190> my<00:01:26.310> sanding

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
this is a sander I do all of my sanding

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.510 
this is a sander I do all of my sanding
on<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:28.290> shaking<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:28.980> he'll<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
on it so if I'm shaking and he'll I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.000 
on it so if I'm shaking and he'll I
would<00:01:30.330> rough<00:01:30.600> sand<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> until<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.800> at<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
would rough sand it until I get at the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.219 
would rough sand it until I get at the
shape<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.400> want

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
shape I want

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.340 
shape I want
and<00:01:33.320> you're<00:01:33.439> not<00:01:33.530> fine<00:01:33.950> stand<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:35.990> I

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
and you're not fine stand it and then I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.999 
and you're not fine stand it and then I
always<00:01:36.979> keep<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.280> cup<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.640> water<00:01:37.939> here

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
always keep a cup of water here

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.130 
always keep a cup of water here
and<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.100> little<00:01:40.369> foam<00:01:40.579> brush<00:01:40.969> because<00:01:41.780> not<00:01:42.110> only

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
and a little foam brush because not only

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.080 
and a little foam brush because not only
can<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.649> shape<00:01:42.950> things<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.520> sander<00:01:43.909> you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
can you shape things on the sander you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.410 
can you shape things on the sander you
can<00:01:44.270> always<00:01:44.420> also<00:01:45.200> get<00:01:45.500> them<00:01:45.880> really<00:01:46.880> polished

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
can always also get them really polished

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.200 
can always also get them really polished
so<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:48.439> would<00:01:48.740> rough<00:01:48.979> seeing<00:01:49.310> something<00:01:49.610> get<00:01:50.090> at

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
so I would rough seeing something get at

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.039 
so I would rough seeing something get at
the<00:01:50.299> shape<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:50.659> want<00:01:50.799> fine<00:01:51.799> stand<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.869> dip<00:01:53.869> my

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
the shape I want fine stand it dip my

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.350 
the shape I want fine stand it dip my
brush<00:01:54.259> in<00:01:54.439> water<00:01:54.649> wet<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.000> what<00:01:56.210> that

brush in water wet it and what that

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.880 
brush in water wet it and what that
water<00:01:56.569> does<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.289> makes<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:57.590> leather

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
water does is it makes the leather
