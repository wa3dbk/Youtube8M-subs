00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to as we ever sink in for episode what

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.510 
to as we ever sink in for episode what
you<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.640> from<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> last<00:00:18.029> episode<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
you see and from the last episode we

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
you see and from the last episode we
thought<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.390> make<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.900> trickin<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.980> tricks

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
thought to make some trickin some tricks

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000 
thought to make some trickin some tricks
and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.590> were<00:00:25.740> quite

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and I think that we are we were quite

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460 
and I think that we are we were quite
successful<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.849> especial<00:00:27.779> comments<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
successful and especial comments as to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
successful and especial comments as to
the<00:00:28.769> last<00:00:28.980> week<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.730> was<00:00:30.349> quite<00:00:31.349> risky<00:00:31.880> maybe

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the last week it was quite risky maybe

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.060 
the last week it was quite risky maybe
in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> video<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.680> but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
in the video you could not see it but

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.510 
in the video you could not see it but
actually<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.760> car<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.149> moving<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.520> just

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
actually the car was moving and just

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
actually the car was moving and just
jumping<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.660> front<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> car<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.739> always

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
jumping in front of the car it's always

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
jumping in front of the car it's always
risky<00:00:41.329> whatever<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> speed<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> car<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
risky whatever the speed of the car is

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
risky whatever the speed of the car is
at<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.980> moment<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.640> therefore<00:00:44.850> we

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
at that moment and therefore we

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
at that moment and therefore we
qualified<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:47.010> risky<00:00:47.340> than<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
qualified it as a more risky than this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
qualified it as a more risky than this
one<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> head<00:00:49.559> spinning<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
one we are as kind of head spinning on

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.979 
one we are as kind of head spinning on
the<00:00:50.160> roof<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.420> could<00:00:51.600> jump<00:00:52.140> away<00:00:52.489> sideways

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the roof I just could jump away sideways

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.860 
the roof I just could jump away sideways
so<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.289> anyway<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.160> episode<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.149> would

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so but anyway in this episode I would

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.680
