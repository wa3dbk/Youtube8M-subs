00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello my name is jacques 10 rue ben 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.340
 I am a cabinetmaker and today I am going 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.330
 show you a technique to strip 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.820
 quickly waxed varnished woods for 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.820
 realize this stripping I will use a 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.989
 stripper called stripper 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.489
 American there is also another 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.610
 similar remover called the 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.599
 stripper she who has that pretty much 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.480
 the same effects 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.120
 concerning the safety rules for 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.129
 the use of this product 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.030
 an important note this product is 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.550
 a product rather dangerous than healy 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.649
 recognizable by his pictograms x is 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.620
 harmful is a product if it is bad 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.929
 employee or if we do not put the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.120
 adapted protections can outright 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.760
 poisoned concerning the elements of 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.980
 personal protection must be worn 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.140
 rubber gloves fit the heard 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.940
 apron and goggles 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.340
 for the eyes in case of projection for 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.409
 apply the product on treated wood 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.360
 we have several possibilities either 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.079
 we use a brush or we use a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.420
 spray 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.800
 today I'm going to use the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.700
 spray technique so game 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.590
 take the original container I pour 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.780
 product in the spray bottle 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.680
 so small clarification regarding the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.930
 spray 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.010
 you have to use a calf 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.590
 vaporizer suitable for use with 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.040
 products if they dilute incident and so 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 right now 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.730
 so the tools that I 'm going to use 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:50.070
 to treat this piece of wood so a 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:55.360
 sprayer filled American stripper 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:59.020
 of small spatula of bodybuilders and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.990
 gex do not use steel wool 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.780
 to prevent metal fibers 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.090
 remain trapped in the wood for 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.290
 product application 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:15.420
 I will go over the entire surface of the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.420
 product wood 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
 using the vaporizer apply the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.680
 produced on the entire surface of the wood 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.460
 treated and let's act a few 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.130
 minutes so that a 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:42.040
 a kind of little crust cracked in 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:47.320
 surface and there it's time to spend the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.310
 spatula to unhook the old layer 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.900
 varnish 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:58.540
 so after removing the group from the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:03.730
 varnish we can iron a small 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.570
 layer of american dca fist let 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:11.230
 act a few minutes and we'll finish 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.360
 with the last jex blow of spatula for 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.040
 still remove the bulk of the varnish that 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:26.500
 can stay on the surface and after finishing 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:31.209
 with the jex so that's a double 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.800
 advantage it removes the small ones 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.680
 traces of varnish that could stay there 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.650
 and in addition to Seychelles a little bit 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.420
 wood of course we see of course the jex 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.850
 the traces of residual varnish that we have 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.680
 removed from the wooden board 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.340
 this is our small stripping board 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.730
 accuracy brought the American stripper 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.500
 do not stain the woods and are not born 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.420
 does not require rinsing with water 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.910
 you know now command cap and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.470
 efficiently and quickly a lath of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.950
 wood 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.510
 wooden slats and now 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.489
 able to receive sanding and a 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.489
 finishing either to niÃ§ois syria 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.560
 and
