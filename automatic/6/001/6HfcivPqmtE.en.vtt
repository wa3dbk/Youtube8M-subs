basically<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.899> courses<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.470> teaching<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.189> up

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
basically the courses on teaching are up

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.499 
basically the courses on teaching are up
to<00:00:09.150> date<00:00:09.179> research<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.050> practices<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.940> very

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
to date research and practices and very

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.939 
to date research and practices and very
often<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:14.330> research<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.750> developed<00:00:16.740> so

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
often the the research is developed so

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.540 
often the the research is developed so
quickly<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:18.330> your<00:00:18.750> training<00:00:19.289> may<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.310> been

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
quickly that your training may have been

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.810 
quickly that your training may have been
10<00:00:21.090> years<00:00:21.119> ago<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.650> much<00:00:22.859> has<00:00:23.070> changed<00:00:23.160> in

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
10 years ago and so much has changed in

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870 
10 years ago and so much has changed in
the<00:00:24.480> last<00:00:24.600> 10<00:00:25.080> years<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.769> terms<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.369> what<00:00:26.670> there

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the last 10 years in terms of what there

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.750 
the last 10 years in terms of what there
is<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> offer<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.720> programs<00:00:28.550> in<00:00:29.550> my

is to offer in these programs in my

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.709 
is to offer in these programs in my
course<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.720> looks<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.320> how<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:32.480> use<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
course it really looks at how to use the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.560 
course it really looks at how to use the
most<00:00:33.899> up-to-date<00:00:34.190> practices<00:00:35.190> based<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.329> good

the<00:00:40.950> two<00:00:41.219> courses<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.850> I've<00:00:41.969> developed<00:00:42.260> go

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the two courses that I've developed go

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.790 
the two courses that I've developed go
hand<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.710> hand<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.160> terms<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:45.800> strengthening

that person effectively without
contaminating<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.439> information<00:01:49.950> you're

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
contaminating the information you're

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.609 
contaminating the information you're
getting<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.610> being<00:01:51.479> able<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> draw<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.259> as

much<00:01:52.890> information<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.700> possible<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> would

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
much information as possible so I would

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.709 
much information as possible so I would
say<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.549> cognitive<00:01:56.549> interviewing<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.299> one

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
say that cognitive interviewing is one

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.590 
say that cognitive interviewing is one
very<00:01:58.200> effective<00:01:58.350> tool<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> evolved<00:02:00.180> only<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
very effective tool is evolved only in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.999 
very effective tool is evolved only in
the<00:02:00.689> last<00:02:00.899> 20<00:02:01.259> years<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.850> has<00:02:03.439> become<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the last 20 years and has become a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.760 
the last 20 years and has become a
standard<00:02:05.399> practice<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.210> many<00:02:07.110> people<00:02:07.380> still

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
standard practice that many people still

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.820 
standard practice that many people still
haven't<00:02:07.950> learned

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
haven't learned

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.950 
haven't learned
and<00:02:09.340> yet<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:09.790> extremely<00:02:10.330> useful<00:02:10.510> for

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
and yet it's extremely useful for

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.550 
and yet it's extremely useful for
investigating<00:02:11.860> any<00:02:12.010> kind<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.370> an<00:02:12.490> event<00:02:12.820> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
investigating any kind of an event and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.170 
investigating any kind of an event and
that's<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.920> areas<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.580> cover<00:02:15.910> in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
that's one of the areas that we cover in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.170 
that's one of the areas that we cover in
this<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.750> these<00:02:16.900> courses<00:02:17.170> over<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.310> last<00:02:18.610> 25

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
this in these courses over the last 25

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.050 
this in these courses over the last 25
years<00:02:19.210> probably<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.950> most<00:02:21.160> significant

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
years probably the most significant

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.930 
years probably the most significant
factor<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.350> has<00:02:23.500> influenced<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.250> change<00:02:24.640> in
