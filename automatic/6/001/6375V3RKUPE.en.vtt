so

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.170 
so
so<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.710> don't<00:03:01.040> think<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.580> about<00:03:01.820> how

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.730 
so I don't think that this is about how
a<00:03:02.210> low<00:03:02.510> payment<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.340> object<00:03:04.490> is<00:03:05.740> this

strange I don't see
I<00:03:10.320> don't<00:03:11.320> see<00:03:11.820> any<00:03:12.820> reason<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.960> think<00:03:14.140> that

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
I don't see any reason to think that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.370 
I don't see any reason to think that
this<00:03:14.740> could<00:03:14.800> be<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> balloon<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:18.460> these<00:03:18.610> people
