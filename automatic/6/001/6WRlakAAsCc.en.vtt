00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.840
 Many people are in close proximity 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.089
 metropolitan areas 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 that is a challenge for him 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.260
 the way to smart city expert asse 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.830
 stockinger explains what it's all about 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.420
 smart city means the cities and the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 especially to make the city of vienna fit 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 for a twentieth century 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.399
 the challenges are the city 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
 The challenge is that we are growing 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.880
 want to switch our energy system up 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 a postfossil and on a 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680
 renewable energy world and in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 mobility we increasingly us from 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.370
 get used to your own car if possible 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 to renounce 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.480
 the first changes are already in the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 go instead of your own car use the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.129
 people increasingly carsharing deals 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 Cycling bus and subway will always be 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.039
 more popular 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.230
 the use of transport varies 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.180
 The future of mobility is mine 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.170
 View marked by more variety 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 and more flexibility and we will 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 also with great offered increasingly 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.060
 be confronted where we just 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.619
 be perfused through the intermodal 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 Find and explain groups easily 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.710
 easy to navigate 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.409
 quando the wiener lines space 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 demonstrated with an innovative 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.009
 mobility platform connects smile 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.170
 all public and individual 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.900
 services in the research project 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.759
 let's try wiener Stadtwerke 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.979
 the lines and together with the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.680
 Austrian Federal Railways one 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.200
 multimodal in formation future and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 pay platform to test 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 we hope that with this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Research project funded by the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 climate and energy fund of vision 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 mobile on demand depending on mobility 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.790
 requires a big step closer to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 come 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.830
 versatility and flexibility for a new one
