00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
we pulled that tractor out it actually

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
we pulled that tractor out it actually
broke<00:01:28.439> into<00:01:28.680> two<00:01:28.860> separate<00:01:29.159> pieces<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.610> there

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
broke into two separate pieces so there

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
broke into two separate pieces so there
was<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> considerable<00:01:30.479> amount<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> fire<00:01:30.990> damage

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
was a considerable amount of fire damage

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
was a considerable amount of fire damage
so<00:01:31.950> why<00:01:32.400> did<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.909> nearly<00:01:33.270> five<00:01:33.630> hours<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
so why did it take nearly five hours to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
so why did it take nearly five hours to
clear<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> roadway<00:01:35.400> well<00:01:35.939> first

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
clear the roadway well first

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240 
clear the roadway well first
firefighters<00:01:37.200> had<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> put<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> flames

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
firefighters had to put out the flames

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.700 
firefighters had to put out the flames
and<00:01:38.670> deal<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.180> fuel<00:01:39.540> spill<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and deal with a fuel spill this is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.560 
and deal with a fuel spill this is
ridiculous<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> truck<00:01:42.150> actually

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
ridiculous because of the truck actually

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
ridiculous because of the truck actually

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
investigation took some time and then

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.550 
investigation took some time and then
heavy<00:01:47.670> tow<00:01:47.970> trucks<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> come<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.259> lift

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
heavy tow trucks had to come in and lift

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
heavy tow trucks had to come in and lift
