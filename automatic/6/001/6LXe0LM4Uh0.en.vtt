00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 due to subsidence there or due to old age 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.000
 a sewer 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.370
 once replaced in a while 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 farmed infrastructure is more than 50 in this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.389
 specialized and has 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.160
 an extensive flew of modern 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.199
 material 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.789
 our employees are motivated and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.580
 often have the years 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.109
 experience in this sector 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 after placing the required 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.400
 deposition is carried out with a loading shovel, the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.960
 pavement removed 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 the houses are made of plastic 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 road plates kept accessible from 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 pedestrians 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 the work area and sidewalk 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.620
 separated by a building fence 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.480
 so that safety is guaranteed 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 local residents can be so safe and with 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 achieve little nuisance in homes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.700
 properties are on both sides of the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700
 accessible by road 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.770
 the appropriate source drainage so that too 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.420
 work under the water surface 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.970
 when the balloon is struck it becomes 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.190
 connected to a ring line 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.290
 a pump then sawed the groundwater 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.019
 and temporarily dispose of it in the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.630
 nearby sewer system 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.940
 we carry one on a lowloader 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.490
 hydraulic crane the crane will be first 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.690
 old ria or uncover and dig 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.590
 old careless 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.590
 do the sewer 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.929
 the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.450
 we place to prevent collapse 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.580
 a heavy steel box in the slot 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.380
 then dig the operator in further 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 decision making the crate in place 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.049
 the old sewage system drops gently 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.270
 dug up and taken away 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.060
 older sewer pipes had no rubber 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.180
 seal and were sometimes say of gray 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.340
 but made breakable baked stone 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.290
 nowadays all pipes are made of concrete 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.280
 equipped with rubber seal 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.320
 which means fewer leaks occur in 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 this cross section you can clearly see how the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.019
 home connections from the main sewer 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.940
 walk to the houses and lie a lot 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.320
 cables and pipes into the ground 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.180
 The Netherlands 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.650
 if we come across these then they become 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.910
 carefully released by hand 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.550
 replacing the new sewer pipes 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.440
 goes in phases of about 10 each time 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.600
 meter 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 the new concrete rubble supplied 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.319
 careful in the previous place the boss 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.970
 concerned 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.150
 A rubber ring ensures that there 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.070
 no water can leak from the boss 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.010
 with a read is checked whether the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.720
 downs are under the right grade 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 the sewer is still in use 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.310
 that's why we place a rubber 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.670
 and Flemish Jobs ball to the sewer down to 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.670
 can close 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.769
 here you see how a so-called pestle 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.659
 which soon weighs more than 50 pounds 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.659
 is shared by the stall in the well 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.950
 by editing the sand next to the boss 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.420
 these stamps prevent the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.690
 direction of the new sewer pipe 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.790
 changed and stomp for the close with 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.430
 ours can be 700 beats per minute 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.650
 the substrate the operator expands and 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.690
 next layer of sandra which in turn 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.160
 is being compacted again on the new one 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.230
 sewer pipes are already the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.420
 position pipe installed on which the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.620
 notes can then be connected 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.690
 this allows during around the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.930
 work the residents just use 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.760
 continue to make their wife water off 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.090
 at this height my chest can be again 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.090
 seduced 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.549
 the main duo is now temporarily on the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.549
 old house connections 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.120
 as you can see there are many connections 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.070
 in property that use it 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.930
 sewer 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.000
 now that the box has been removed, the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.760
 last layer of sand are applied and 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.150
 divide this time there will be use 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.040
 made from a so-called curl paste 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.580
 here you can clearly see from above that the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.350
 replacement of the sewer in phases 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.270
 in the bottom right of the screen you can see ours 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.360
 other team is now working on it 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.250
 replacing the house connections 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.820
 And so we go house by house throughout 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.820
 pile 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.090
 Also in the house connections, the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.550
 sand layer will be good point closed now 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.200
 Be the first to put the curbstones in 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.480
 the street 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.870
 we do it due to health and safety reasons 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.430
 this as much as possible mechanically as the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.160
 band then the sidewalk tiles go 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.880
 here too, there is as much as possible 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.650
 worked mechanically and mini crane makes this 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.000
 hole for the tree and the planted 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.800
 to become 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.120
 the won hole is first filled with 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.120
 special trees ground 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.780
 eventually the tree can become 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.220
 placed 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.880
 it also becomes other street furniture 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.010
 placed like the light towers in it 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.190
 the so-called street pots come on the road 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.870
 who have to feed the rainwater 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.950
 the swirls are connected to it 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.840
 sewer or on a separate rainwater drain 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.180
 then the parking spaces first 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.660
 the street because the street work is related 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.760
 often different from the highway section 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.260
 the roadway is added last 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.430
 in swept and resigned as work 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.410
 the required amount 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:40.210
 deposits together with the construction fences 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.340
 removed and the equipment becomes 8 for 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.720
 after which traffic and living in use 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.720
 able to make from ribesstraat 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.100
 and we are already on our way to one 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.100
 next job
