00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.950 
we're making some special fried rice
using<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.210> fantastic<00:00:15.210> new<00:00:15.630> wok<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.750> you

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
using my fantastic new wok so first you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.939 
using my fantastic new wok so first you
preheat<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.560> wok<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:19.949> medium<00:00:20.369> heat<00:00:21.859> then<00:00:22.859> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
preheat the wok at medium heat then I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.849 
preheat the wok at medium heat then I
put<00:00:23.189> 1<00:00:23.699> tablespoon<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> cooking<00:00:25.140> oil<00:00:25.289> into<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
put 1 tablespoon of cooking oil into the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.740 
put 1 tablespoon of cooking oil into the
wok<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> coconut<00:00:28.260> oil<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
wok so I use a coconut oil which is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
wok so I use a coconut oil which is
pretty<00:00:30.750> resistant<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.470> heat<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> won't

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
pretty resistant to heat so it won't

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.700 
pretty resistant to heat so it won't
burn<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:33.000> easily<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> other<00:00:34.860> oils

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
burn as easily as some of the other oils

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.049
