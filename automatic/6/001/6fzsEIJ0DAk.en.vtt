on<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:29.940> first<00:04:30.210> intro<00:04:30.630> level<00:04:31.010> well<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.250> don't

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
on this first intro level well I don't

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.770 
on this first intro level well I don't
know<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.760> designers<00:04:33.180> been<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.630> way

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
know if the designers been it that way

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.170 
know if the designers been it that way
but<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.110> found<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.590> very<00:04:34.650> very<00:04:35.070> funny<00:04:35.430> so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
but I found it very very funny so

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.220 
but I found it very very funny so
basically<00:04:36.420> you're<00:04:36.660> going<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.870> how<00:04:36.930> about<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
basically you're going to how about the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.110 
basically you're going to how about the
back<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.620> point<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.280> he's<00:04:38.640> probably<00:04:38.910> i'm

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
back of the point and he's probably i'm

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.550 
back of the point and he's probably i'm
saying<00:04:39.150> you're<00:04:39.510> smart<00:04:39.810> for<00:04:39.960> figuring<00:04:40.260> stuff

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
saying you're smart for figuring stuff

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.770 
saying you're smart for figuring stuff
out<00:04:40.890> so<00:04:41.760> you're<00:04:41.970> going<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.300> jump<00:04:42.540> out<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.750> back

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
out so you're going to jump out the back

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.170 
out so you're going to jump out the back
here<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.950> course<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.250> whole<00:04:44.370> plane<00:04:44.610> goes

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
here and of course the whole plane goes

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.820 
here and of course the whole plane goes
up<00:04:45.360> smoke<00:04:45.540> so<00:04:46.110> i'll<00:04:46.260> go<00:04:46.380> ahead<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.530> skip<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
up smoke so i'll go ahead and skip the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.230 
up smoke so i'll go ahead and skip the
explosion<00:04:47.340> here<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.730> now<00:04:47.880> we're<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.150> the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
explosion here and now we're on the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.080 
explosion here and now we're on the
island<00:04:48.600> below<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.250> I'm<00:04:50.250> caught<00:04:50.700> in<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:50.850> tree

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
island below and I'm caught in a tree

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.430 
island below and I'm caught in a tree
a'course<00:04:51.420> over<00:04:51.720> there<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.020> right<00:04:52.080> hand

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
a'course over there on the right hand

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.290 
a'course over there on the right hand
side<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.520> what<00:04:53.640> do<00:04:53.700> you<00:04:53.760> have<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:53.940> do<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.150> course

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
side so what do you have to do of course

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.510 
side so what do you have to do of course
you<00:04:54.600> have<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.840> shake<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.770> get<00:04:55.890> down<00:04:56.130> out<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.460> the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
you have to shake to get down out of the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.690 
you have to shake to get down out of the
tree<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:58.440> like<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.710> would<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.430> set

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
tree and just like you would you set

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.490 
tree and just like you would you set
there<00:04:59.850> and<00:04:59.880> hold<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.720> know<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:01.200> remote

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
there and hold the you know we remote

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.440 
there and hold the you know we remote
and<00:05:01.650> shake<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:01.830> reminds<00:05:02.820> me<00:05:02.940> quite<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.240> bit<00:05:03.270> of

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
and shake it reminds me quite a bit of

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.030 
and shake it reminds me quite a bit of
Rayman<00:05:03.840> Raving<00:05:03.870> Rabbids<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.740> with<00:05:04.919> better

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
Rayman Raving Rabbids just with better

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.420 
Rayman Raving Rabbids just with better
graphics<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.820> homes<00:05:06.120> more<00:05:06.540> fun<00:05:06.780> gameplay

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430

alright<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.730> now<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:08.940> got<00:05:09.210> out<00:05:09.360> of<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.540> tree

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
alright so now I got out of the tree

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.650 
alright so now I got out of the tree
there<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:11.520> planes<00:05:11.820> on<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.030> compression

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
there and the planes on the compression

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.930 
there and the planes on the compression
out<00:05:12.840> on<00:05:12.960> this<00:05:13.050> little<00:05:13.230> island<00:05:13.410> I'm<00:05:13.830> on<00:05:14.010> so

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
out on this little island I'm on so

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.920 
out on this little island I'm on so
they're<00:05:15.120> going<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.330> go<00:05:15.390> ahead<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.630> show<00:05:15.810> it

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
they're going to go ahead and show it

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.360 
they're going to go ahead and show it
here<00:05:16.110> well<00:05:16.440> after<00:05:16.710> they<00:05:16.980> showed<00:05:17.160> me<00:05:17.190> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
here well after they showed me the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.490 
here well after they showed me the
treasure<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.940> inside<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.570> treasure<00:05:18.930> box<00:05:19.260> is

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
treasure and inside that treasure box is

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.010 
treasure and inside that treasure box is
actually<00:05:20.100> barbaros<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.450> think<00:05:21.690> that's<00:05:21.870> how<00:05:21.990> you

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
actually barbaros I think that's how you

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.200 
actually barbaros I think that's how you
say<00:05:22.320> his<00:05:22.350> name<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.250> just<00:05:23.460> skip<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.730> part<00:05:24.000> of

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
say his name so I just skip the part of

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.180 
say his name so I just skip the part of
the<00:05:24.690> plane<00:05:25.200> but<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.500> can<00:05:25.650> see<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.890> up<00:05:25.980> there<00:05:26.010> in

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
the plane but you can see it up there in

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.960 
the plane but you can see it up there in
the<00:05:26.250> top<00:05:26.430> left<00:05:26.930> ok<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:27.990> here's<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.970> basically

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
the top left ok so here's the basically

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.430 
the top left ok so here's the basically
I'm<00:05:30.090> trying<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.390> push<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.720> tree<00:05:30.990> down<00:05:31.169> here

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
I'm trying to push the tree down here

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.110 
I'm trying to push the tree down here
I'm<00:05:31.740> going<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:31.950> shake<00:05:32.160> it<00:05:32.370> now<00:05:32.760> thats<00:05:32.940> not

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
I'm going to shake it now thats not

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.380 
I'm going to shake it now thats not
