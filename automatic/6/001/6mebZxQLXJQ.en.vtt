00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.540
 First, clean the glass with kitchen paper soaked in alcohol, and then place it on the template. 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.980
 Start by drawing a tree with a black universal contour. 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.340
 Always work with pulling movements. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.660
 Draw flowers with a transparent contour. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.580
 Highlight the leaves with a golden universal contour. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 Use the same contour for the remaining lines. 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:26.580
 Tip: Remove the excess from the outline by wiping periodically with kitchen paper. 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.780
 The drying time for the universal loop is at least 30 minutes. 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:43.180
 Then begin to fill the tree trunk with a dark brown and transparent alcohol-based glass paint. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.700
 Mix the two colors with a brush. 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.460
 Continue until you reach the base. 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.860
 Tip: Wipe off any accidental drops of the surface immediately. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 Always clean the brush in aloe-base cleaning solution if you will use another color or have finished the job. 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.020
 Color the leaves by blending green and yellow. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.220
 Use different colors and a thin brush for flowers. 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.980
 Fill rectangles with solid colors. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.580
 Paint the background by blending transparent and blue paint. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.340
 Wait for at least 2 hours to dry the glass paint. Then decorate the branches with the outline. 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.260
 And then the tree trunk. 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.540
 Use a gold border to decorate the flowers and leaves.
