you own the stove so that you can save

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.960

yourself a little money and a little

yourself a little money and a little
headache<00:00:27.859> first<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.130> I'd<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> point

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
headache first of all I'd like to point

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.120 
headache first of all I'd like to point
out<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> two<00:00:30.420> blowers<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.109> either<00:00:31.349> side<00:00:31.769> are

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
out the two blowers on either side are

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
out the two blowers on either side are
very<00:00:32.309> effective<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.059> pulling<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.960> room<00:00:34.230> air

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
very effective at pulling the room air

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.950 
very effective at pulling the room air
through<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> stove<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.640> getting<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> heat

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
through the stove and getting the heat

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
through the stove and getting the heat
out<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> stove<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.370> they're<00:00:38.489> 2<00:00:38.760> 200

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
out of the stove I think they're 2 200

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.229 
out of the stove I think they're 2 200
cubic<00:00:39.660> feet<00:00:40.020> per<00:00:40.320> minute<00:00:40.760> blowers<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> they

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
cubic feet per minute blowers and they

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
cubic feet per minute blowers and they
work<00:00:42.450> excellent<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.250> hear

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
work excellent and as you can hear

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.959 
work excellent and as you can hear
they're<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.940> high<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> that's<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.850> they

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
they're on high now so that's what they

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
they're on high now so that's what they
sound<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.600> high<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.469> gonna

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
sound like on high and then I'm gonna

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
sound like on high and then I'm gonna
turn<00:00:49.890> them<00:00:50.100> down<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> rheostat<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
turn them down with the rheostat so you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.910 
turn them down with the rheostat so you
can<00:00:51.770> turn<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.070> way<00:00:53.190> down<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> can

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
can turn it all the way down so you can

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
can turn it all the way down so you can
barely<00:00:56.160> hear<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:56.940> watching<00:00:57.059> TV<00:00:57.510> or

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
barely hear it if you're watching TV or

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
barely hear it if you're watching TV or
you<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.410> you're<00:00:58.649> talking<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.640> barely

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you know you're talking you can barely

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.490 
you know you're talking you can barely
hear<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.420> low<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.320> great<00:01:01.559> feature

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
hear it on low so it's a great feature

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.469 
hear it on low so it's a great feature
next<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.280> firebox

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
next is the firebox

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.390 
next is the firebox
it's<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.930> 2.25<00:01:07.740> cubic<00:01:08.610> foot<00:01:08.909> firebox<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
it's a 2.25 cubic foot firebox which is

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's a 2.25 cubic foot firebox which is
considered<00:01:11.400> medium<00:01:11.880> medium<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> large

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
considered medium medium to large

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
considered medium medium to large
firebox<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.159> usually<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.790> 3

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
firebox they go up to usually around 3

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120 
firebox they go up to usually around 3
or<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.630> over<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.500> bigger<00:01:16.710> stoves

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
or a little over and some bigger stoves

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.660 
or a little over and some bigger stoves
but<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.450> hold<00:01:18.659> an<00:01:18.869> 18<00:01:19.320> inch<00:01:19.530> log<00:01:19.890> which

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
but this will hold an 18 inch log which

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
but this will hold an 18 inch log which
I<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> wish<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.540> hold<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> bigger

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
I kind of wish it would hold a bigger

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
I kind of wish it would hold a bigger
log<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.549> every<00:01:24.210> once

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
log just because you know every once

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
log just because you know every once
while<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.140> too<00:01:25.350> big<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> have

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
while you get one too big and you have

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.560 
while you get one too big and you have
to<00:01:25.979> go<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.220> cut<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.420> nice

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to go out and cut it so it would be nice

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.240 
to go out and cut it so it would be nice
if<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.159> bigger<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
if it was a little bit bigger but as you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
if it was a little bit bigger but as you
can<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.909> firebox<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.780> lined<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
can see the firebox is lined on the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.789 
can see the firebox is lined on the
inside<00:01:35.479> okay<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.659> I've<00:01:36.750> got<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> small<00:01:37.530> fire

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
inside okay and I've got a small fire

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
inside okay and I've got a small fire
going<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.150> easier<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
going in there because it's easier to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.719 
going in there because it's easier to
see<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.950> video<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:43.430> one<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.579> nice

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
see in the video and one of the nice

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
see in the video and one of the nice
features<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> damper<00:01:45.960> system<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.710> lever

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
features is the damper system this lever

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.240 
features is the damper system this lever
actually<00:01:47.790> controls<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:49.079> inputs<00:01:49.740> into<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually controls two inputs into the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.999 
actually controls two inputs into the
fire<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.869> straight<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> front

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
fire one is straight into the front

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.950 
fire one is straight into the front
which<00:01:53.310> feeds<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> bottom<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> fire<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
which feeds the bottom of the fire and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
which feeds the bottom of the fire and
then<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> second<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.369> there's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> tube<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
then the second one there's a tube that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.880 
then the second one there's a tube that
runs<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.840> back<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> stove<00:01:58.649> which

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
runs to the back of the stove which

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.310 
runs to the back of the stove which
heats<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> air<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.200> at

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
heats up the air and if you can see at

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.530 
heats up the air and if you can see at
the<00:02:01.469> top<00:02:01.710> there's<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:03.979> reburn<00:02:04.979> system<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the top there's a reburn system that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.469 
the top there's a reburn system that
blows<00:02:07.320> air<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> top<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
blows air in the top and then that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.229 
blows air in the top and then that
reburn<00:02:10.140> x'<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.679> gas<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.400> coming<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> fire

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
reburn x' the gas is coming off the fire

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.170 
reburn x' the gas is coming off the fire
which<00:02:12.599> is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
which is

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.110 
which is
very<00:02:13.359> effective<00:02:13.629> so<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.819> pretty<00:02:16.030> much

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
very effective so this is pretty much

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.209 
very effective so this is pretty much
the<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:16.689> an<00:02:16.900> excellent<00:02:17.260> stove<00:02:17.590> one<00:02:17.950> feature

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
the it's an excellent stove one feature

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.899 
the it's an excellent stove one feature
is<00:02:18.519> if<00:02:18.700> you're<00:02:18.879> gonna<00:02:19.030> open<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.569> door<00:02:20.909> don't

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
is if you're gonna open the door don't

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.699 
is if you're gonna open the door don't
just<00:02:22.180> open<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.659> door<00:02:22.840> because<00:02:23.109> smoke<00:02:23.530> will

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
just open the door because smoke will

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.619 
just open the door because smoke will
come<00:02:23.859> into<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.250> room<00:02:24.489> one<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.060> negatives

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
come into the room one of the negatives

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.630 
come into the room one of the negatives
of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> stoves<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.500> doesn't<00:02:26.859> have<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> bypass

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
of the stoves it doesn't have a bypass

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.250 
of the stoves it doesn't have a bypass
in<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.090> back<00:02:28.329> that<00:02:28.599> some<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.930> other<00:02:29.079> ones

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
in the back that some of the other ones

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.280 
in the back that some of the other ones
like<00:02:29.409> low<00:02:29.709> P<00:02:30.090> will<00:02:31.090> have<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.299> bypass<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
like low P will have a bypass in the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.339 
like low P will have a bypass in the
back<00:02:32.469> which<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.859> can<00:02:33.040> bypass<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:34.349> reborn'

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
back which you can bypass the reborn'

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.240 
back which you can bypass the reborn'
system<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.209> it'll<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:38.739> smoke<00:02:39.010> will<00:02:39.219> go

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
system and it'll the smoke will go

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
system and it'll the smoke will go
directly<00:02:39.549> out<00:02:39.969> of<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> back<00:02:40.299> of<00:02:40.329> the<00:02:40.659> stove

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
directly out of the back of the stove

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.959 
directly out of the back of the stove
and<00:02:41.319> then<00:02:41.980> it'll<00:02:42.129> keep<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.670> know<00:02:42.700> from

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
and then it'll keep it you know from

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.000 
and then it'll keep it you know from
letting<00:02:43.659> smoking<00:02:44.260> when<00:02:44.409> you<00:02:44.500> open<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.829> door

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
letting smoking when you open the door

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.360 
letting smoking when you open the door
but<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.310> can<00:02:45.959> open<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.079> door<00:02:47.290> very<00:02:47.620> slowly

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
but you can open the door very slowly

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.199 
but you can open the door very slowly
and<00:02:49.079> then<00:02:50.079> let<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.560> draught<00:02:50.950> change<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:52.030> then

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
and then let the draught change and then

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.000 
and then let the draught change and then
very<00:02:52.480> slowly<00:02:52.569> open<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.530> door<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.889> then<00:02:53.980> you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
very slowly open the door and then you

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.640 
very slowly open the door and then you
won't<00:02:54.250> get<00:02:54.459> smoke<00:02:54.909> into<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.480> room<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.200> then

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
won't get smoke into the room and then

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.319 
won't get smoke into the room and then
you<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.829> open<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.400> door<00:02:57.549> very<00:02:57.760> effectively

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
you can open the door very effectively

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.699 
you can open the door very effectively
so<00:02:58.719> that's<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.230> tip<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.510> other<00:03:01.659> tip<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.319> in

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
so that's one tip the other tip is in

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.459 
so that's one tip the other tip is in
the<00:03:03.129> on<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.609> top<00:03:03.909> there's<00:03:04.329> these<00:03:04.510> two<00:03:04.569> baffles

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
the on the top there's these two baffles

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.679 
the on the top there's these two baffles
that<00:03:05.590> run<00:03:05.950> along<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:07.000> can't<00:03:07.180> really<00:03:07.299> see<00:03:07.599> them

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
that run along you can't really see them

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.929 
that run along you can't really see them
but<00:03:07.930> there's<00:03:08.349> these<00:03:08.560> two<00:03:08.620> baffles<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.669> run

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
but there's these two baffles that run

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.959 
but there's these two baffles that run
along<00:03:10.419> the<00:03:10.659> top<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.169> the<00:03:11.260> stove<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.879> know

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 
along the top of the stove and you know

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.000 
along the top of the stove and you know
putting<00:03:13.359> wood<00:03:13.629> in<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.169> you<00:03:14.409> tear<00:03:14.709> them<00:03:14.829> up

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
putting wood in you you tear them up

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.789 
putting wood in you you tear them up
pretty<00:03:15.280> good<00:03:15.400> if<00:03:15.700> you're<00:03:15.819> not<00:03:15.849> careful

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
pretty good if you're not careful

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.890 
pretty good if you're not careful
somebody<00:03:17.799> told<00:03:18.040> me<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.340> those<00:03:19.030> baffles<00:03:19.359> are

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
somebody told me that those baffles are

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.839 
somebody told me that those baffles are
really<00:03:20.739> supposed<00:03:20.949> to<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.159> replaced<00:03:21.579> with

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
really supposed to be replaced with

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.939 
really supposed to be replaced with
brick<00:03:22.180> which<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.229> know<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.379> replace<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
brick which you know to replace the

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.250 
brick which you know to replace the
baffles<00:03:24.340> they're<00:03:24.519> 80<00:03:24.729> bucks<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.930> replace

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
baffles they're 80 bucks but to replace

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.469 
baffles they're 80 bucks but to replace
it<00:03:26.409> with<00:03:26.530> brick<00:03:26.799> it's<00:03:26.979> like<00:03:27.129> $15<00:03:27.819> at<00:03:27.970> Menards

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
it with brick it's like $15 at Menards

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.879 
it with brick it's like $15 at Menards
and<00:03:28.569> that's<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.900> way<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.109> was<00:03:29.169> designed<00:03:29.620> but

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
and that's the way it was designed but

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.589 
and that's the way it was designed but
they<00:03:30.010> put<00:03:30.189> the<00:03:30.310> baffles<00:03:30.699> up<00:03:30.879> there<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.419> it'll

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
they put the baffles up there so it'll

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.080 
they put the baffles up there so it'll
save<00:03:32.229> them<00:03:32.409> on<00:03:32.530> shipping<00:03:32.859> which<00:03:33.729> I<00:03:33.879> thought

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
save them on shipping which I thought

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.819 
save them on shipping which I thought
was<00:03:34.239> very<00:03:34.299> interesting<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.260> takes<00:03:35.470> six

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
was very interesting so it takes six

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.460 
was very interesting so it takes six
bricks<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:36.790> top<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.419> it<00:03:37.959> can<00:03:38.109> probably

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
bricks on the top and it can probably

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.710 
bricks on the top and it can probably
make<00:03:38.889> your<00:03:39.069> stove<00:03:39.310> more<00:03:39.549> efficient<00:03:40.389> so<00:03:40.569> I'm

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
make your stove more efficient so I'm

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.369 
make your stove more efficient so I'm
gonna<00:03:40.900> do<00:03:41.199> that<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:42.569> as<00:03:43.569> soon<00:03:43.750> as<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.989> can<00:03:44.199> get

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
gonna do that just as soon as I can get
