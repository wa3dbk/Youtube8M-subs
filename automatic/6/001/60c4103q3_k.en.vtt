okay<00:00:01.070> this<00:00:02.070> model<00:00:02.610> represents<00:00:03.200> what

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
okay this model represents what

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.499 
okay this model represents what
structure<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:06.170> long<00:00:07.170> back<00:00:09.170> less<00:00:10.170> than<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.469> lobe

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
structure a long back less than a lobe

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.250 
structure a long back less than a lobe
just<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.990> little<00:00:13.580> lobule<00:00:14.580> okay<00:00:15.599> there's<00:00:15.990> more

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
just a little lobule okay there's more

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950 
just a little lobule okay there's more
than<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.470> alveolar<00:00:17.010> sac<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.550> mean<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.480> say

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
than one alveolar sac I mean here say

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.150 
than one alveolar sac I mean here say
that<00:00:19.640> that's<00:00:20.640> an<00:00:20.850> alveolar<00:00:21.150> sac<00:00:21.980> by<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> way

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that that's an alveolar sac by the way

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.370 
that that's an alveolar sac by the way
is<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.340> pointer<00:00:23.640> show<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:23.880> okay<00:00:24.150> okay

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is this pointer show up okay okay

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
is this pointer show up okay okay
that's<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:26.039> alveolar<00:00:26.310> sac<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:27.420> around<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that's an alveolar sac see around the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.609 
that's an alveolar sac see around the
single<00:00:28.349> antrum<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.230> various

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
single antrum and we have the various

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.520 
single antrum and we have the various
alveoli<00:00:32.399> too<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.329> open<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.290> one

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
alveoli too all open into this one

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.910 
alveoli too all open into this one
Antrim<00:00:35.239> okay<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.200> feelers<00:00:37.530> sack

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
Antrim okay and this out feelers sack

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
Antrim okay and this out feelers sack
then<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> end<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.930> turn<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.230> on

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
then is it the end of if I turn it on

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.350 
then is it the end of if I turn it on
around<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.670> show<00:00:41.879> alveolar

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
around you can see they show alveolar

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440 
around you can see they show alveolar
ducts<00:00:42.719> quite<00:00:43.020> nicely<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:44.210> okay

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
ducts quite nicely here okay

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.790 
ducts quite nicely here okay
now<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.829> confusing<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.149> model

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
now the thing is confusing on this model

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.709 
now the thing is confusing on this model
is<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.730> learned<00:00:50.940> about<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> anatomy<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
is we have learned about the anatomy of

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.540 
is we have learned about the anatomy of
the<00:00:54.719> circulatory<00:00:55.140> system<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.370> lung

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the circulatory system in the lung

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.250 
the circulatory system in the lung
family<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.829> vessel<00:00:59.190> here

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
family and we know that this vessel here

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.690 
family and we know that this vessel here
next<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> airway<00:01:02.399> must<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.420> an

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
next to the airway must be a what an

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
next to the airway must be a what an
artery<00:01:05.700> huh<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.350> color<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.200> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
artery huh and what color is it and what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.250 
artery huh and what color is it and what
color<00:01:10.560> should<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.210> blue<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
color should it be blue because it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.060 
color should it be blue because it
should<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.740> carrying<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:16.070> deoxygenated

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
should be carrying what deoxygenated

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.719 
should be carrying what deoxygenated
blood<00:01:17.990> being<00:01:18.990> carried<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.040> alveoli

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
blood being carried down to the alveoli

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
blood being carried down to the alveoli
okay<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> capillary<00:01:22.650> networks

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
okay and we see the capillary networks

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.030 
okay and we see the capillary networks
on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> alveoli<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> oxygen

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
on the alveoli here to do the oxygen

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
on the alveoli here to do the oxygen
exchange<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.360> carbon<00:01:27.630> dioxide<00:01:27.990> exchange

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
exchange and the carbon dioxide exchange

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.819 
exchange and the carbon dioxide exchange
a<00:01:29.210> little<00:01:30.210> bit<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.450> today's<00:01:30.720> lecture<00:01:30.930> big<00:01:31.439> time

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a little bit in today's lecture big time

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.760 
a little bit in today's lecture big time
and<00:01:32.159> next<00:01:32.369> lecture<00:01:32.759> okay<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and next lecture okay and then that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
and next lecture okay and then that
blood<00:01:35.009> gathers<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.549> together<00:01:35.700> comes<00:01:36.090> over

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
blood gathers back together comes over

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.560 
blood gathers back together comes over
here<00:01:36.509> into<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.960> vessel<00:01:37.259> which<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
here into this vessel which is the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
here into this vessel which is the
pulmonary<00:01:39.570> vein<00:01:40.020> which<00:01:40.409> should<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.970> nice<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
pulmonary vein which should be nice and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
pulmonary vein which should be nice and
bright<00:01:42.390> red<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> understand<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> mistake

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
bright red so you understand the mistake

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.800 
bright red so you understand the mistake
on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.820> way<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.329> made<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.979> shows<00:01:47.850> okay

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on the way this is made it shows okay

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.710 
on the way this is made it shows okay
the<00:01:48.960> airway<00:01:49.670> coming<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.299> would<00:01:51.540> be

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the airway coming down and this would be

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
the airway coming down and this would be
a<00:01:51.750> quat<00:01:53.840> bronchus<00:01:55.280> because<00:01:56.280> what's<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.579> blue

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
a quat bronchus because what's this blue

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.590 
a quat bronchus because what's this blue
stuff<00:01:57.740> hyaline<00:01:58.740> cartilage<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.450> get

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
stuff hyaline cartilage and as we get

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.340 
stuff hyaline cartilage and as we get
down<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> smaller<00:02:01.850> bronchi<00:02:03.170> we<00:02:04.170> have

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
down to the smaller bronchi we have

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.160 
down to the smaller bronchi we have
plates<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.040> cartilage<00:02:05.899> somewhere<00:02:06.899> down<00:02:07.140> here

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
plates of cartilage somewhere down here

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.850 
plates of cartilage somewhere down here
the<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.310> cartilage<00:02:08.849> goes<00:02:09.119> away<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:10.619> soon

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the the cartilage goes away and as soon

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.950 
the the cartilage goes away and as soon
as<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> cartilage<00:02:11.610> goes<00:02:11.849> away<00:02:12.150> these

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
as the cartilage goes away these

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.940 
as the cartilage goes away these
their<00:02:13.140> ways<00:02:13.320> are<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:14.690> bronchioles<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.140> then

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
their ways are what bronchioles and then

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890 
their ways are what bronchioles and then
they<00:02:17.070> become<00:02:17.340> respiratory<00:02:17.940> bronchioles<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
they become respiratory bronchioles and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.850 
they become respiratory bronchioles and
then<00:02:19.200> alveolar<00:02:19.680> ducts<00:02:21.020> what<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.200> model<00:02:22.590> also

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
then alveolar ducts what this model also

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.020 
then alveolar ducts what this model also
shows<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.610> importance<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> us<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.790> nice

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
shows of importance to us is this nice

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.810 
shows of importance to us is this nice
bright<00:02:27.540> red<00:02:27.780> vessel<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.590> they're<00:02:29.460> showing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
bright red vessel here they're showing

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.360 
bright red vessel here they're showing
it<00:02:29.970> redder<00:02:30.270> than<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:32.250> to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
it redder than this one just to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.310 
it redder than this one just to
delineate<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.450> think<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.960> see<00:02:34.200> it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
delineate it I think so you can see it

we<00:03:00.090> think<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.750> don't<00:03:00.840> need<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.140> take<00:03:01.290> oxygen

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
we think you don't need to take oxygen

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.530 
we think you don't need to take oxygen
to<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> lungs<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.460> there<00:03:02.580> are<00:03:02.790> places<00:03:03.120> that

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
thing works is this way okay these are

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.310 
thing works is this way okay these are
retinoids<00:05:54.630> swivel<00:05:56.190> they<00:05:57.190> turn<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:58.030> as<00:05:58.930> they

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
retinoids swivel they turn and as they

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.650 
retinoids swivel they turn and as they
swivel<00:05:59.740> as<00:06:00.130> they<00:06:00.460> turn<00:06:00.760> they<00:06:00.970> can<00:06:01.030> open<00:06:01.479> and

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
swivel as they turn they can open and

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.920 
swivel as they turn they can open and
close<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.110> glottis<00:06:02.530> open<00:06:03.010> close<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.970> they

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
close the glottis open close and they

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.629 
close the glottis open close and they
can<00:06:05.110> increase<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:05.740> decrease<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:06.340> pressure

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
can increase and decrease the pressure

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.310 
can increase and decrease the pressure
now<00:06:07.740> they<00:06:08.740> open<00:06:09.160> and<00:06:09.310> close<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.699> glottis

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
now they open and close the glottis

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.110 
now they open and close the glottis
that's<00:06:11.320> very<00:06:11.590> important<00:06:12.010> they<00:06:12.099> increase<00:06:12.910> and

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
that's very important they increase and

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.150 
that's very important they increase and
decrease<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.510> pressure<00:06:13.979> apparently<00:06:14.979> there's

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
decrease the pressure apparently there's

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.240 
decrease the pressure apparently there's
more<00:06:15.220> involved<00:06:15.760> in<00:06:15.880> that<00:06:16.169> okay<00:06:17.250> increasing

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
more involved in that okay increasing

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.680 
more involved in that okay increasing
and<00:06:18.400> decreasing<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.940> pressure<00:06:19.240> on<00:06:19.570> those

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
and decreasing the pressure on those

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.480 
and decreasing the pressure on those
vocal<00:06:20.110> folds<00:06:20.440> changes<00:06:20.919> the<00:06:21.039> pitch<00:06:21.250> of<00:06:21.460> your

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
vocal folds changes the pitch of your

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.200 
vocal folds changes the pitch of your
voice<00:06:23.010> you<00:06:24.010> can<00:06:24.160> run<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.490> pressure<00:06:24.760> up<00:06:25.030> and

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
voice you can run the pressure up and

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.439 
voice you can run the pressure up and
make<00:06:25.330> it<00:06:25.449> vibrate<00:06:25.630> fast<00:06:26.460> or<00:06:27.460> you<00:06:27.610> can<00:06:27.669> run<00:06:28.300> the

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
make it vibrate fast or you can run the

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.890 
make it vibrate fast or you can run the
pressure<00:06:28.690> down<00:06:29.020> let<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.620> vibrates<00:06:30.250> low<00:06:30.900> but

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
pressure down let it vibrates low but

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.560 
pressure down let it vibrates low but
there's<00:06:32.139> another<00:06:32.470> thing<00:06:32.860> do<00:06:33.460> it<00:06:33.669> there's

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
there's another thing do it there's

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.640 
there's another thing do it there's
another

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
another

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.850 
another
to<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:36.280> pitch<00:06:36.699> and<00:06:37.540> if<00:06:37.930> you<00:06:38.229> put<00:06:38.830> your

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
to that pitch and if you put your

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.840 
to that pitch and if you put your
fingers<00:06:39.460> on<00:06:39.729> your<00:06:40.180> larynx<00:06:40.630> and<00:06:41.520> make<00:06:42.520> it<00:06:42.699> and

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
fingers on your larynx and make it and

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:49.140 
fingers on your larynx and make it and
just<00:06:43.030> hum<00:06:43.360> a<00:06:43.389> high<00:06:43.720> pitch<00:06:46.169> he'll<00:06:47.169> go<00:06:47.410> up<00:06:47.850> okay<00:06:48.850> I

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
just hum a high pitch he'll go up okay I

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.680 
just hum a high pitch he'll go up okay I
think<00:06:49.750> as<00:06:50.169> it<00:06:50.320> goes<00:06:50.530> up<00:06:50.560> that<00:06:51.550> that<00:06:51.789> stretches

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
think as it goes up that that stretches

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.240 
think as it goes up that that stretches
the<00:06:53.620> vocal<00:06:54.610> cords<00:06:55.000> and
