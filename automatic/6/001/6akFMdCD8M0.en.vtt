hello friends welcome to gizmo advisors

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.770 
hello friends welcome to gizmo advisors
in<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.370> video<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.700> am<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.420> review<00:00:12.719> the

Eureka<00:00:16.170> place<00:00:16.379> comes<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> 13<00:00:17.550> megapixel

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Eureka place comes with the 13 megapixel

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
Eureka place comes with the 13 megapixel
camera<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:19.800> has<00:00:20.070> Sony<00:00:21.029> BSI<00:00:21.510> sensor<00:00:21.720> this

camera and it has Sony BSI sensor this

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.500 
camera and it has Sony BSI sensor this
enhances<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> camera<00:00:23.640> performance<00:00:24.150> when

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
enhances the camera performance when

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
enhances the camera performance when
compared<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> Eureka<00:00:25.460> now<00:00:26.460> let's<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
compared to Eureka now let's have a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
compared to Eureka now let's have a
quick<00:00:27.150> look<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> camera<00:00:28.260> interface<00:00:28.560> of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
the Eureka plus it has similar interface
as<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.579> saw<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> Eureka<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.899> other

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
as we saw on the Eureka and other

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.250 
as we saw on the Eureka and other
solution<00:00:38.100> mode<00:00:38.309> devices<00:00:38.660> now<00:00:39.660> let's<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.230> a
