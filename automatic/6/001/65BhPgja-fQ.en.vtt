 main initiates 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.990
 the nozzles serve as a trigger for 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.210
 the mixture of combustible air in a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.730
 internal combustion engine spark plug 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.380
 real is designed to get the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.540
 maximum performance of an engine to 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.430
 different revolutions 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.610
 the components of a music are the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.330
 following the cap or cap 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.840
 screwed the ceramic base the hexagon 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.909
 for the tap the thread and the electro 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.560
 the slots of the ceramic surface of 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.659
 a spark plug ensure insulation 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.340
 electric these also avoid 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.960
 electric shocks from outside of 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.329
 this component as we can 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.310
 appreciate in the following image as 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.420
 can see the operation of the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.329
 machine in a combustion engine 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.039
 internal in the third time we call him 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.130
 explosion and it is an inside the sparkplug 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.729
 work here brito let's see how 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.189
 enters the gasoline compresses explodes and 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.079
 here escapes this is the operation of 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.370
 a spark plug in no combustion engine 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.560
 internal 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.720
 The thermal range of a spark plug is 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.520
 measure of heat dissipated in this and it 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.470
 expressed by a number in this 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.320
 occasion we have a real spark plug and with 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.390
 rtc nomenclature 8 that tells us 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.340
 which is a cold spark plug for tall 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.290
 speeds and high revolutions 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.000
 the real music and you can find it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.810
 very economical and excellent price 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.950
 quality 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.959
 You will also find it in six 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.640
 different nomenclatures that comply with 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.620
 the applications of motorcycles that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.239
 today they circulate around your city for the elderly 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.239
 reports consult the process 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.769
 on behalf of many cracks and equipment and 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.049
 the group heaps thank you 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.879
 and we hope that this information has
