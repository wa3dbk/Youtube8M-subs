00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 web video prepare yourself in this 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.099
 case the video is dedicated to the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 repair of a solenoid valve 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.469
 water input from washing machine or from 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.539
 dishwasher using the accessory that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.270
 you have seen in another previous video for 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.310
 try to hook the solenoid valve to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 the other module we will apply a little 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 of oil to the car we will apply the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.529
 accessory that we have made in the other 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 video and using an air pump the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 bike 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.239
 will promote the oil through the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 valve so that pennetta in the same 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 let's try the solenoid valve first 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.320
 and we will see that it is damaged and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 how can we solve it for this 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.879
 small repair we will use the one of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.489
 another mangÃº the accessory a little 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.360
 a pump action tape complaint 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.670
 bike 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.940
 an oil pan with car oil 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.280
 car engine 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.489
 the water gum from our washing machine for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.100
 to be able to test our valve 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.060
 the multipurpose test cable that you know 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.830
 of the website for yourself and we're going to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.830
 proceed to test the hard lock 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.940
 all 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.000
 why 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.930
 we connect the same 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.680
 to the water hose of our 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 washing machine 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.270
 we open the stopcock 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 and that of this valve drips slightly 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.130
 this valve has a water leak and the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.470
 plugged in before I had a little more of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.020
 water now lose a little bit but one 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 drop that should not be lost therefore 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.930
 let's proceed to grease the same 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.930
 close the stopcock 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.980
 we dismantle 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.509
 the letter valve 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.640
 previously before recording them in this 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.610
 case I'm not going to do it but what 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.380
 you should be to take the path of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.319
 front and clean with soapy water 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.989
 the whole part 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.760
 of water intake to try to withdraw 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.159
 the remains of lime the small stones 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.629
 I had and others I'm not going to 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.130
 organize since this is organized in 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.440
 other videos 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.790
 the same as trying to clean with a 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.790
 brush on the front 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.070
 we will not give away hook 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.160
 our power cord 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.220
 to the solenoid valve because the thread of 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.849
 our utensil does not close 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.810
 hermetically we will apply a little 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.810
 of Teflon tape 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.430
 tape used by plumbers 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.349
 and a little more 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.640
 yes 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.300
 we apply oil 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.790
 we fill 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.520
 the whole entry 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.980
 Y 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.780
 with thread, our accessory 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.220
 we plug in 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.830
 in the bicycle air pump 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.810
 As you can see in this video, use gloves 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 especially for precautionary issues and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.940
 that we are going to be touching water and 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.690
 electric current to avoid 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.690
 accidents 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.720
 we plug in and we make sure that the same 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.720
 that is offline 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.480
 you have the cable explained in the 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.530
 web page for yourself and others 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.530
 my previous times 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.120
 we apply current to the letter valve 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.670
 Now that we have it ready 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.670
 we will proceed 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.290
 to pump air 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.090
 if we remove the power supply the 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.090
 of swallowing is repaired 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.979
 two 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.750
 we see that he still has a small 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:21.190
 air loss therefore 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.190
 it would be a matter of 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:29.300
 reapply 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:33.110
 another oil sheet 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.520
 that as we can see the oil has passed 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.229
 inside the high valve 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.020
 we would apply oil again and 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.000
 we would repeat the operation in order 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.350
 of greasing the entire interior of the 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.540
 electro valve properly 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.580
 as you see a small utensil that we 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.220
 It can be useful to repair 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.370
 electro washer valves and 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.370
 dishwasher 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.940
 I have already commented that you do not have explained 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.490
 in another video this video is the second 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.070
 of a series of two where it is explained in 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.040
 the first how to make the utensil and 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.760
 the second we are going to repair oiling in 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.760
 electrovalve 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:15.030
 I hope the video has been of 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.990
 utility that encourages you to try to repair 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.970
 certain elements of our 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.310
 appliances that can be 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.720
 comparable and that you keep visiting the 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.720
 chrome website for the same
