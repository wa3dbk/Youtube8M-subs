a dyno is all set will actually sit back

00:01:31.490 --> 00:02:11.450 
a dyno is all set will actually sit back
and<00:01:31.670> watch<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.120> show

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.660 

right<00:02:12.290> looks<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.740> good<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> real

right looks really good we have a real
nice<00:02:15.000> clean<00:02:16.340> 300<00:02:17.340> horsepower<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.540> we've<00:02:19.080> got

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
nice clean 300 horsepower and we've got

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.720 
nice clean 300 horsepower and we've got
enough<00:02:21.710> 550<00:02:22.710> foot-pounds<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.400> torque

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
enough 550 foot-pounds of torque

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.630 
enough 550 foot-pounds of torque
so<00:02:24.710> looks<00:02:25.710> really<00:02:25.980> good<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.400> got<00:02:26.550> to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so looks really good now you got to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.560 
so looks really good now you got to
remember<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:28.070> 20%<00:02:29.070> loss<00:02:29.390> from<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
remember this is a 20% loss from the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.840 
remember this is a 20% loss from the
engine<00:02:30.960> due<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.320> running<00:02:31.650> gear<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.160> this

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
engine due to the running gear so this

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.340 
engine due to the running gear so this
engine<00:02:33.060> stock<00:02:33.540> should<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.200> around

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
engine stock should be right around

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.860 
engine stock should be right around
three<00:02:34.770> sixty<00:02:35.220> five<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.750> six<00:02:36.750> hundred

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
three sixty five and six hundred

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.170 
three sixty five and six hundred
foot-pounds<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.700> looks<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:38.910> we're

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
foot-pounds and so it looks like we're

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.960 
foot-pounds and so it looks like we're
right<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.570> money<00:02:40.070> losing<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.160> 20%<00:02:41.880> in

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
right on the money losing that 20% in

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.720 
right on the money losing that 20% in
our<00:02:42.090> number<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.660> everything<00:02:43.290> looks<00:02:43.500> good<00:02:43.730> now

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
our number and everything looks good now

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.370 
our number and everything looks good now
