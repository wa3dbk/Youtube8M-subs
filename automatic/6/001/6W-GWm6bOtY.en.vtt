the<00:01:16.280> IMP<00:01:16.430> totalbiscuit<00:01:17.030> said<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.360> only

the IMP totalbiscuit said the only
answer<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.200> can<00:01:18.320> think<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.620> is<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:18.920> about

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
answer you can think of is it's about

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.990 
answer you can think of is it's about
money<00:01:19.900> really<00:01:20.950> not<00:01:21.950> selling<00:01:22.430> people<00:01:22.580> things

somehow<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.780> about<00:01:24.020> money<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:25.460> doesn't<00:01:25.729> help

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
somehow is about money that doesn't help

make<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.030> lot<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.360> sense<00:01:27.190> well<00:01:28.190> of<00:01:28.250> course<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
make a lot of sense well of course the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.940 
make a lot of sense well of course the
idea<00:01:28.940> is<00:01:29.180> if<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.600> withhold<00:01:29.990> something<00:01:30.560> long

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
idea is if you withhold something long

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.440 
idea is if you withhold something long
enough<00:01:30.979> more<00:01:31.549> people<00:01:31.700> will<00:01:31.880> buy<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.119> when<00:01:32.360> you

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
enough more people will buy it when you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.550 
enough more people will buy it when you
do<00:01:32.600> sell<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.020> because<00:01:33.110> you'll<00:01:33.380> build

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
do sell it because you'll build

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.539

habit<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.740> refusing<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.430> make<00:01:55.549> enough<00:01:55.820> copies

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
habit of refusing to make enough copies

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.580 
habit of refusing to make enough copies
to<00:01:56.360> meet<00:01:56.540> demand<00:01:56.930> they<00:01:57.229> would<00:01:57.380> withhold

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
to meet demand they would withhold

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.620 
to meet demand they would withhold
things<00:01:58.010> for<00:01:58.189> long<00:01:58.280> periods<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.640> time<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.150> all

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
things for long periods of time and all

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.420 
things for long periods of time and all
sorts<00:02:00.049> of<00:02:00.110> things<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.680> they<00:02:00.950> even<00:02:01.070> sunk

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
sorts of things like that they even sunk

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.850 
sorts of things like that they even sunk
as<00:02:01.580> low<00:02:01.610> as<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.970> make<00:02:02.090> their<00:02:02.240> games<00:02:03.170> last<00:02:03.500> left

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
as low as to make their games last left

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.980 
as low as to make their games last left
last<00:02:04.130> for<00:02:04.340> less<00:02:04.490> time<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.330> course<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.869> can

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
last for less time and of course you can

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.179 
last for less time and of course you can
probably<00:02:06.229> guess<00:02:06.350> how<00:02:06.590> well<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:07.009> was

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
probably guess how well that was

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.929 
probably guess how well that was
received<00:02:07.610> not<00:02:08.360> very<00:02:08.599> well<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.700> thing<00:02:10.909> that

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
received not very well so the thing that

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.170 
received not very well so the thing that
the<00:02:11.419> thing<00:02:11.689> is<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:13.400> not<00:02:13.639> about<00:02:13.879> money

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
the thing is it's not about money

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.560 
the thing is it's not about money
because<00:02:15.109> both<00:02:15.469> logically<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.219> appear

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
because both logically and appear

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.820 
because both logically and appear
withholding<00:02:17.570> product<00:02:17.960> from<00:02:18.050> people<00:02:18.440> does<00:02:18.650> not

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
withholding product from people does not

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.060 
withholding product from people does not
make<00:02:19.100> more<00:02:19.370> money<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.660> why<00:02:21.650> would<00:02:21.890> game

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
make more money so why would game

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.980 
make more money so why would game
companies<00:02:22.490> be<00:02:22.670> doing<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.480> possible

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
companies be doing this what possible

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.240 
companies be doing this what possible
reason<00:02:24.320> could<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> if<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.860> not<00:02:27.920> muff

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
reason could it be so if it's not muff

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
reason could it be so if it's not muff
it's<00:02:28.520> not<00:02:28.640> about<00:02:28.790> money<00:02:29.800> why<00:02:30.800> would<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.790> game

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
it's not about money why would a game

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.960 
it's not about money why would a game
company<00:02:32.480> would<00:02:33.170> not<00:02:33.200> sell<00:02:33.830> games<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.520> public

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
company would not sell games to a public

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.580 
company would not sell games to a public
that<00:02:35.120> wants<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.570> what<00:02:35.990> reason<00:02:36.350> would<00:02:36.470> they

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
that wants it what reason would they

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
that wants it what reason would they
have<00:02:37.720> well<00:02:38.720> what<00:02:39.020> if<00:02:39.140> they<00:02:39.320> wanted<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:40.010> but

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
have well what if they wanted to but

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.180 
have well what if they wanted to but
they<00:02:40.730> couldn't<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.590> think<00:02:42.590> that's<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.800> much<00:02:42.950> more

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
they couldn't I think that's a much more

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.110 
they couldn't I think that's a much more
reasonable<00:02:43.520> idea<00:02:43.960> so<00:02:45.730> who<00:02:46.730> logically<00:02:47.510> could

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
reasonable idea so who logically could

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.270 
reasonable idea so who logically could
prevent<00:02:50.120> could<00:02:50.750> prevent<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.560> company<00:02:51.980> from

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
prevent could prevent a company from

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.010 
prevent could prevent a company from
selling<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.850> public<00:02:53.270> who<00:02:53.450> wanted<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> buy<00:02:53.990> it

negotiate your way through a lot of
bureaucracy<00:03:17.210> before<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.440> them<00:03:18.640> self

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
bureaucracy before you can them self

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.460 
bureaucracy before you can them self
before<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.180> can<00:03:20.240> sell<00:03:20.600> things<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.900> Australia

before you can sell things to Australia
if<00:03:21.560> you're<00:03:21.739> not<00:03:21.920> from<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.430> part<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.270> some

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
if you're not from there part of some

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.780 
if you're not from there part of some
preserving<00:03:24.410> their<00:03:24.530> heritage<00:03:24.860> nonsense<00:03:25.640> or

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
preserving their heritage nonsense or

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.160 
preserving their heritage nonsense or
something<00:03:26.060> like<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.209> i'm<00:03:26.690> not<00:03:26.750> sure<00:03:26.930> what

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
something like that i'm not sure what

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.400 
something like that i'm not sure what
the<00:03:27.320> rationale<00:03:27.800> is<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.870> yeah<00:03:30.020> so<00:03:30.200> let's<00:03:30.350> think

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
the rationale is but yeah so let's think

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.500 
the rationale is but yeah so let's think
about<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.790> game<00:03:31.970> company<00:03:32.120> wants<00:03:32.480> to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
about it so if a game company wants to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.060 
about it so if a game company wants to
sell<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.810> australia<00:03:33.350> they<00:03:33.770> have<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.950> go

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
sell to australia they have to go

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.590 
sell to australia they have to go
through<00:03:34.100> more<00:03:34.459> bureaucracy<00:03:34.790> which<00:03:35.360> means

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
through more bureaucracy which means

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.229 
through more bureaucracy which means
more<00:03:35.900> time<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.500> more<00:03:36.650> money<00:03:36.920> spent<00:03:37.280> do<00:03:38.180> you

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
more time and more money spent do you

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.460 
more time and more money spent do you
think<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:38.600> would<00:03:38.750> discourage<00:03:39.140> game

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
think this would discourage game

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.840 
think this would discourage game
companies<00:03:39.830> from<00:03:39.950> selling<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.400> australia<00:03:40.790> at

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
companies from selling to australia at

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.890 
companies from selling to australia at
the<00:03:40.880> same<00:03:41.090> time<00:03:41.270> as<00:03:41.330> everyone<00:03:41.720> else

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
the same time as everyone else

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.690 
the same time as everyone else
considering<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.620> takes<00:03:42.860> longer<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.400> cost

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
considering it takes longer and cost

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.130 
considering it takes longer and cost
more<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.239> order<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:44.720> i<00:03:45.520> think<00:03:46.520> so<00:03:46.760> and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
more in order to do so i think so and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.420 
more in order to do so i think so and
doesn't<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.320> explanation<00:03:48.680> make<00:03:49.040> far<00:03:49.400> more
