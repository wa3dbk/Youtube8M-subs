00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.940 
straighter than them I mean it's pretty
straight<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:26.000> might<00:01:26.299> curve<00:01:26.720> out<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.229> little<00:01:27.740> bit

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
straight it might curve out a little bit

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.980 
straight it might curve out a little bit
at<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.130> tip<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:28.880> that's<00:01:29.090> here<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.570> don't<00:01:29.750> sit

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
at the tip but that's here you don't sit

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.370 
at the tip but that's here you don't sit
there<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.259> just<00:01:30.380> gradually<00:01:31.479> turn<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:33.079> just

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
there and just gradually turn it's just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.700 
there and just gradually turn it's just
like<00:01:33.909> straight<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.240> usually<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.170> tip<00:01:36.439> is

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
like straight and usually the tip is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.609 
like straight and usually the tip is
worth<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:37.939> cannot<00:01:38.329> get<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:39.079> straight

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
worth that but you cannot get a straight
