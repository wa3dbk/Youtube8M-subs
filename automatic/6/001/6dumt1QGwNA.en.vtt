00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
job of being stealthy here dropping over

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
to our one hopefully pick up the back

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.309 
to our one hopefully pick up the back
smack<00:03:56.800> which<00:03:57.400> he<00:03:57.550> does<00:03:57.819> appear<00:03:58.810> he<00:03:58.959> just<00:03:59.140> needs

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
smack which he does appear he just needs

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
great decision to back off they're not

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.270 
great decision to back off they're not
to<00:04:05.110> risk<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:08.140> he<00:04:08.290> sees<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.650> gun<00:04:08.830> are<00:04:09.040> one

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
to risk that so he sees that gun are one

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.580 
to risk that so he sees that gun are one
again<00:04:09.700> nice<00:04:09.940> awareness<00:04:10.540> he<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.170> act<00:04:11.349> old

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
again nice awareness he and act old

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.449 
again nice awareness he and act old
working<00:04:11.950> well<00:04:12.130> together<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:14.290> he<00:04:14.950> gets<00:04:15.130> naked

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
working well together and he gets naked

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.000 
working well together and he gets naked
unfortunately<00:04:16.450> his<00:04:16.989> awareness<00:04:17.229> again<00:04:17.739> could

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
unfortunately his awareness again could

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.229 
unfortunately his awareness again could
have<00:04:18.100> been<00:04:18.190> just<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.489> bit<00:04:18.790> better<00:04:18.940> there

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
have been just a bit better there

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.020 
have been just a bit better there
because<00:04:19.510> those<00:04:19.720> guys<00:04:19.870> came<00:04:20.109> from<00:04:20.290> r1<00:04:20.799> but<00:04:21.760> it's

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
because those guys came from r1 but it's

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.090 
because those guys came from r1 but it's
also<00:04:22.210> kind<00:04:22.960> of<00:04:23.020> his<00:04:23.139> teammates<00:04:23.500> fault<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:24.010> not

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
also kind of his teammates fault for not

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.190 
also kind of his teammates fault for not
calling<00:04:24.340> them<00:04:24.610> out

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
calling them out

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.750 
calling them out

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
gameplay from not light that was a

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.230 
gameplay from not light that was a
little<00:06:55.569> 50<00:06:55.900> ml<00:06:56.199> g<00:06:56.380> guys<00:06:56.590> and<00:06:56.919> his<00:06:57.130> team<00:06:57.370> ended

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
up with the six-point lead you might be

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.550 
up with the six-point lead you might be
saying<00:07:00.910> you<00:07:01.090> know<00:07:01.270> oh<00:07:01.630> they<00:07:01.900> were<00:07:01.960> up<00:07:02.169> a<00:07:02.289> player

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
but the play that quit out was a bit

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.409 
but the play that quit out was a bit
weaker<00:07:04.599> so<00:07:04.990> that's<00:07:05.949> how<00:07:06.099> it<00:07:06.220> goes<00:07:06.419> anyway

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
weaker so that's how it goes anyway
