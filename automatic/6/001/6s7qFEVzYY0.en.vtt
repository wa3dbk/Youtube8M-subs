in my brackish water tank ah so anyway
yeah<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:16.830> day<00:02:17.400> number<00:02:17.700> two<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.240> can't

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
yeah that's day number two I can't

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.450 
yeah that's day number two I can't
believe<00:02:18.600> how<00:02:18.870> clear<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.470> water<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.710> today<00:02:22.460> it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
believe how clear the water is today it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.610 
believe how clear the water is today it
looks<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.820> little<00:02:23.970> cloudy<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.840> camera<00:02:25.140> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
looks a little cloudy on this camera I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
looks a little cloudy on this camera I
think<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.640> air<00:02:26.880> bubbles<00:02:27.300> on<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
think because of the air bubbles on the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.440 
think because of the air bubbles on the
side<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.020> tank<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> haven't<00:02:30.120> wiped

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
side of the tank that I haven't wiped

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.610 
side of the tank that I haven't wiped
off<00:02:30.690> yet<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:33.080> completely<00:02:34.080> crystal

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
off yet but it is completely crystal

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.160 
off yet but it is completely crystal
clear<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:37.830> stay<00:02:38.100> too
