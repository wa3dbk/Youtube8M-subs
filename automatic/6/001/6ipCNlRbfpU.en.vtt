00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
red game red case RDS and my cousin also

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.290 
red game red case RDS and my cousin also
known<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.800> Bray<00:00:32.009> days<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.340> YouTube<00:00:32.669> will

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
known as Bray days on YouTube will

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.220 
known as Bray days on YouTube will
likely<00:00:33.510> get<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.079> blue<00:00:34.770> vs<00:00:35.489> Book<00:00:36.450> One<00:00:36.630> X<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
likely get the blue vs Book One X and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
likely get the blue vs Book One X and
the<00:00:37.469> blue<00:00:37.590> case<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> figure<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> will<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the blue case so I figure that will just

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
the blue case so I figure that will just
keep<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.420> opposites<00:00:39.809> because<00:00:40.050> that's<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
keep it opposites because that's how I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
keep it opposites because that's how I
usually<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.340> things<00:00:41.610> anyway<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:43.020> take<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
usually do things anyway I'll take the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.420 
is kind of nice i think i'm going to
enjoy<00:03:26.530> playing<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.980> i<00:03:27.070> think<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.370> to

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
enjoy playing it i think it's going to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.060 
enjoy playing it i think it's going to
serve<00:03:27.670> its<00:03:27.790> purpose<00:03:28.260> let's<00:03:29.260> also<00:03:29.440> take<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.920> look

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
serve its purpose let's also take a look

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.280 
serve its purpose let's also take a look
at<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.400> case<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:31.000> i<00:03:31.030> got<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.450> official<00:03:32.050> in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
at the case that i got the official in

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.470 
at the case that i got the official in
federal<00:03:32.500> carrying<00:03:32.739> cases<00:03:32.920> 1299<00:03:33.670> not<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.300> bad

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
federal carrying cases 1299 not a bad

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.930 
federal carrying cases 1299 not a bad
deal<00:03:34.630> at<00:03:34.690> all<00:03:35.370> obviously<00:03:36.370> because<00:03:36.520> this

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
deal at all obviously because this

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.030 
deal at all obviously because this
doesn't<00:03:37.300> fold<00:03:37.600> like<00:03:37.810> its<00:03:37.959> predecessors<00:03:38.560> you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
doesn't fold like its predecessors you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.380 
doesn't fold like its predecessors you
do<00:03:39.160> want<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.340> have<00:03:39.459> some<00:03:39.640> sort<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:39.970> case<00:03:40.150> 24

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
do want to have some sort of case 24

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.760 
do want to have some sort of case 24
then<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.660> probably<00:03:41.050> wanna<00:03:41.290> recommend<00:03:41.530> just

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
then I probably wanna recommend just

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.680 
then I probably wanna recommend just
carrying<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.100> around<00:03:42.190> asses<00:03:42.880> socially

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
carrying it around asses socially

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.729 
carrying it around asses socially
because<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.930> could<00:03:44.050> probably<00:03:44.200> easily<00:03:44.380> drop

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
because you could probably easily drop

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.350 
because you could probably easily drop
it<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.040> stuff<00:03:45.310> I'm<00:03:45.790> sure<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.150> get<00:03:46.270> some

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
it and stuff I'm sure you can get some

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.670 
it and stuff I'm sure you can get some
kind<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.570> nice<00:03:46.780> case<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.350> actually<00:03:47.380> just

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
kind of nice case it actually just

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.140 
kind of nice case it actually just
covers<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.070> whole<00:03:48.190> device<00:03:48.610> when<00:03:49.000> you're

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
covers the whole device when you're

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.729 
covers the whole device when you're
playing<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.630> but<00:03:50.110> I'm<00:03:50.230> not<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.410> kind<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.620> guy

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
playing it but I'm not the kind of guy

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.410 
playing it but I'm not the kind of guy
who<00:03:50.800> likes<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.250> have<00:03:51.459> cases<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.970> interfere

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
who likes to have cases that interfere

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.030 
who likes to have cases that interfere

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
with my usability I like that a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.010 
with my usability I like that a
protection<00:03:54.430> case<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.150> they<00:03:55.510> protects<00:03:55.840> it

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
protection case and they protects it

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.870 
protection case and they protects it
when<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.260> don't<00:03:56.470> need<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.830> otherwise<00:03:57.520> though<00:03:57.850> I

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
some gains in there I think so not bad

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.580 
some gains in there I think so not bad
at<00:04:39.700> all<00:04:39.910> cool<00:04:40.570> little<00:04:40.780> case<00:04:41.020> definitely<00:04:41.380> worth

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
at all cool little case definitely worth

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.320 
at all cool little case definitely worth
the<00:04:41.680> 12<00:04:41.920> bucks<00:04:42.190> let's<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:42.700> how<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.850> dsi

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
the 12 bucks let's see how the dsi

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.060 
the 12 bucks let's see how the dsi
actually<00:04:43.540> fits<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:43.930> there<00:04:44.050> so<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.620> think<00:04:44.770> you

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
actually fits in there so I think you

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.500 
actually fits in there so I think you
put<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:45.400> there<00:04:45.550> right<00:04:45.730> like<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.210> or

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
put it in there right like this or

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.970 
put it in there right like this or
actually<00:04:46.870> since<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.200> games<00:04:47.380> are<00:04:47.560> on<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.770> end

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
actually since the games are on this end

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.590 
actually since the games are on this end
maybe<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> put<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.850> in<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> other<00:04:49.150> way<00:04:49.360> I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
maybe you put it in the other way I

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.360 
maybe you put it in the other way I
