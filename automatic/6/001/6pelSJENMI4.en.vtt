00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.700
 so here is a short video that you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.460
 will make your own tank 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 matter an assessor the packaging the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 first step of brewing everything would go 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 so first of all the material you will have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.330
 need a cooler of about 45 to 50 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.490
 liters 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 ideally with a hole on the side 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 like that you will not need to 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.250
 to drill one with a drill 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.519
 then you will not need in the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.140
 tube about 48 inches long a tube 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.149
 for devices that use 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 hot water like embers 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.090
 what is interesting is that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.090
 in the parish and small holes that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 will allow you to do the filtration 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.829
 then I needed little threads 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 aluminum 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 then you need a wave 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.219
 of a half an inch gold the times of a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.539
 adapter boast half an inch at the same 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 time rings for tightening a 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 small pan of a half post tax times 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.129
 snui always being the adapters 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.500
 of night inches and then finally some 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 lock nuts why Latvian 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 because it's a solution that's 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.530
 more expensive which allows you to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.159
 keep an equipment that does not see 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.290
 quickly forget the whole 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.890
 material explained in the description 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.159
 of video so let's start first 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.680
 you need to davis and the system that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.890
 close the small hole on the side by 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 frosty so it's very simple challenge you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 it's all and then you keep it small 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.509
 ring here that allows you to close 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.890
 much more watertight 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.399
 then you come to place the little 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 rubber ring that you kept 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 on the bridge being like these and then 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 you just place the coin inside 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.210
 of your cooler 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.149
 once all in place you come 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.149
 place the nuts on both sides 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:25.670
 then you come slip nada by remove 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.620
 everything you need to take your hose from 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.880
 dishwasher or screw machines 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.880
 steel come cut the ends 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.630
 once the end cut well you have to 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.170
 remove the plastic tube from the sheath 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.060
 in metal so you just pushed here 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.500
 against the metal tube to 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.020
 take out the plastic pipe 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.550
 once the plastic tube well 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.310
 removed you have to fold the titles 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.320
 metal size that stand out from 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.320
 not to cut your fingers 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.150
 then you take your son 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.410
 of aluminum and you surround him around 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.560
 of a pencil so as to make it a 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.769
 tube that you can then insert 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.870
 in your filtration tube so 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:39.769
 to give it a structure to not 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.210
 that they crash under the weight of one 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.760
 time 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.560
 the well-rolled metal wire you do not have 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.070
 that at their entry into your stuff like 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.070
 This site 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.850
 Then came his calves adapting 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.850
 half an inch to your end a time 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:14.100
 then go and place the rings in 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.100
 stainless steel at the end of your tube 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:31.210
 and then fix it on your end haunt them 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:39.370
 rings one is then you just have 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:41.470
 life is your wave outside and 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.780
 finally you add your last 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.780
 adopting a half inch to the valve 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.510
 now the morning cub and four for 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.510
 the tests 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.300
 the morning tank is full one can 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.610
 see its sealing and then 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.500
 opens in laval we see that the water flows 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.480
 normally gold here you are 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.210
 now able to build your 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.920
 own cube matter less than 50 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.100
 dollars 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.100
 cheers
