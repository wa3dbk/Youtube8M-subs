00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.040
 you know that in the world of internet 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.410
 there are many deceptions and frauds for that 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.599
 every time I publish a news 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.670
 I'm in charge of investigating the background and 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.910
 check that the sources of the news 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.940
 they are true never published by 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.920
 publish and today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.900
 something that seems surprising but that 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.000
 it is also true a cyclops shark one 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.240
 one-eyed shark that was 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.789
 found in mexico when the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.609
 uterus of one of a female shark 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.089
 bull as you can see the following 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:42.760
 photos in the shark is completely 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.679
 just like a bull shark but with a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.089
 eye only after having performed 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.670
 certain experiments after having 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.190
 analyzed the shark tissue that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.289
 obviously he was already dead 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.319
 they found that his eye was made of 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.300
 functional optical fabric with which therefore 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.789
 there was a plastic eye 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 it was about a real eye and the shark was 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:12.050
 a real shark taken from the uterus 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.330
 of a bull shark mother 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.820
 it is unlikely that the evil creature 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.450
 formed would have survived outside the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.990
 matrix 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 the expert felipe galván magaña del 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.390
 interdisciplinary mexico center 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.300
 marine science said that this was 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 extremely rare and as far as 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.080
 they have data the case of a shark with 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.420
 only one eye has been produced 50 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.820
 times in what leads to the species 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.820
 human researching these specimens 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.810
 the odds of this rare mutation 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.180
 Genetics are scarce 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.640
 here we have another video talking about the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.670
 more rare animal mutations that 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.619
 exist on planet earth I do not know if 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 this mutation will have been caused by the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.240
 pollution or if it will be a mutation 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.619
 natural but it is clear that here there is 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.619
 something that does not work well
