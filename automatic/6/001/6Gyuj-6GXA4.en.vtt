so<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.669> is<00:02:50.790> how<00:02:50.909> it<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.090> sound<00:02:51.919> regular

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
so this is how it will sound regular

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.179 
so this is how it will sound regular
okay<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.299> when<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.169> hit<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.500> D<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:56.010> when

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
okay so when you hit this D is when

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:28.290 
okay so when you hit this D is when
you'll<00:02:56.370> hit<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.760> b-flat

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:04:00.930 

come<00:03:29.230> on<00:03:29.320> do<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.470> again

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.470 

so<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.720> that's<00:04:03.230> okay<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.650> play<00:04:04.210> but<00:04:05.210> if<00:04:05.330> you

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
so that that's okay to play but if you

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.210 
so that that's okay to play but if you
really<00:04:05.810> want<00:04:05.960> to<00:04:06.050> excel<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.530> really<00:04:06.890> kind<00:04:07.100> of

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
really want to excel and really kind of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.730 
really want to excel and really kind of
work<00:04:07.580> on<00:04:07.820> your<00:04:09.460> fluidity<00:04:10.460> it's<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.210> great<00:04:11.390> word

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
work on your fluidity it's a great word

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.020 
work on your fluidity it's a great word
this<00:04:12.740> is<00:04:12.800> how<00:04:13.130> you<00:04:13.220> kind<00:04:13.460> of<00:04:13.550> want<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.820> each

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
this is how you kind of want to do each

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.000 
this is how you kind of want to do each
hand<00:04:14.390> completes<00:04:14.750> each<00:04:14.870> other<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.739> what<00:04:18.890> I<00:04:18.920> do

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
hand completes each other so what I do

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.380 
hand completes each other so what I do
is<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.610> are<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:21.620> I'll<00:04:21.799> go<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.940> I'm<00:04:23.060> gonna<00:04:23.240> roll

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
is you are so I'll go and I'm gonna roll

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:39.240 
is you are so I'll go and I'm gonna roll
it

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:47.490 

i'ma<00:04:40.250> show<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.580> again

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.400 

see<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.370> demo<00:04:48.670> pulse<00:04:49.110> I'll<00:04:50.110> show<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.350> it

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
see this demo pulse I'll show you it

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.210 
see this demo pulse I'll show you it
again<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.220> watch<00:04:51.310> both<00:04:51.550> hands

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.560 

what<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.250> just<00:04:58.340> did<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.669> I<00:04:58.790> rolled<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.240> did<00:04:59.419> at

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
what I just did is I rolled I did at

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.290 
what I just did is I rolled I did at
that<00:04:59.600> fifth<00:05:00.020> sometimes<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.590> do<00:05:00.650> add<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.040> fifth

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
that fifth sometimes I do add the fifth

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:16.390 
that fifth sometimes I do add the fifth
but<00:05:02.300> on<00:05:02.360> occasion

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:30.830 

second<00:05:17.400> time<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.669> do

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.800 

for<00:05:31.840> us<00:05:35.040> normally<00:05:36.040> on<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.280> chorus<00:05:36.640> I'll<00:05:36.820> pulse

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
for us normally on the chorus I'll pulse

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.310 
for us normally on the chorus I'll pulse
it

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
it

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.970 
it
and<00:05:38.710> I'll<00:05:38.890> break<00:05:39.070> it<00:05:43.320> it's<00:05:44.320> just<00:05:44.560> chords<00:05:44.860> but

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
and I'll break it it's just chords but

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:52.860 
and I'll break it it's just chords but
you'll<00:05:45.130> see<00:05:45.250> my<00:05:45.430> inversions

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.070 

so<00:05:53.800> when<00:05:53.980> I'm<00:05:54.070> playing<00:05:54.220> this<00:05:54.430> G<00:05:54.730> um<00:05:55.139> G<00:05:56.139> minor

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
so when I'm playing this G um G minor

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.170 
so when I'm playing this G um G minor
inversion<00:05:59.080> of<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.320> flat<00:06:00.870> inversion<00:06:01.870> of<00:06:01.900> C<00:06:02.080> minor

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
inversion of a flat inversion of C minor

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.700 
inversion of a flat inversion of C minor
and<00:06:04.180> what<00:06:04.330> you're<00:06:04.450> playing<00:06:04.690> here<00:06:04.990> is<00:06:05.200> B<00:06:05.560> flat

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
and what you're playing here is B flat

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.279 
and what you're playing here is B flat
over<00:06:05.950> F<00:06:07.680> D<00:06:08.680> over<00:06:09.010> F<00:06:09.160> sharp

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
over F D over F sharp

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.950 
over F D over F sharp
this<00:06:11.069> just<00:06:11.309> works<00:06:11.639> for<00:06:12.300> placement<00:06:12.689> instead<00:06:12.869> of

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
this just works for placement instead of

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.269 
this just works for placement instead of
trying<00:06:13.139> to<00:06:13.199> figure<00:06:13.439> out<00:06:13.499> how<00:06:13.740> to<00:06:13.770> go<00:06:14.039> across

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
trying to figure out how to go across

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.010 
trying to figure out how to go across
the<00:06:14.399> keyboard<00:06:14.729> to<00:06:14.819> find<00:06:14.999> your<00:06:15.119> chords<00:06:15.449> they're

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
the keyboard to find your chords they're

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.389 
the keyboard to find your chords they're
all<00:06:16.169> in<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.379> same<00:06:16.529> place<00:06:16.740> it's<00:06:17.009> just<00:06:17.279> very

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
all in the same place it's just very

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.760 
all in the same place it's just very
subtle<00:06:17.819> movements<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.330> some<00:06:18.930> fingers<00:06:19.229> mostly

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
subtle movements of some fingers mostly

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.499 
subtle movements of some fingers mostly
your<00:06:19.889> hand<00:06:20.039> will<00:06:20.159> stay<00:06:20.279> in<00:06:20.339> the<00:06:20.399> same<00:06:20.520> place<00:06:20.639> so

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
your hand will stay in the same place so

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.629 
your hand will stay in the same place so
that's<00:06:21.719> the<00:06:21.899> chorus<00:06:22.289> then<00:06:23.099> you'll<00:06:23.339> go<00:06:23.460> back

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
that's the chorus then you'll go back

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.609 
that's the chorus then you'll go back
into<00:06:23.819> a<00:06:23.909> verse<00:06:24.149> so<00:06:24.360> you'll<00:06:24.509> go<00:06:24.659> immediately<00:06:25.050> in

00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:25.619 
into a verse so you'll go immediately in

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.889 
into a verse so you'll go immediately in
to<00:06:26.309> the<00:06:26.819> melody<00:06:27.180> of<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.300> verse<00:06:27.539> I'm<00:06:27.779> gonna

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:27.899 
to the melody of the verse I'm gonna

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:31.700 
to the melody of the verse I'm gonna
show<00:06:28.050> you<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.169> chorus<00:06:29.719> and<00:06:30.719> if<00:06:31.229> you<00:06:31.349> want<00:06:31.529> you<00:06:31.619> to

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
show you a chorus and if you want you to

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.480 
show you a chorus and if you want you to
have<00:06:31.800> to<00:06:31.889> do<00:06:31.979> this<00:06:32.099> you<00:06:32.909> just<00:06:33.089> the<00:06:33.180> chord

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:57.580 

I<00:06:35.630> just<00:06:36.630> do<00:06:36.720> what<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:36.930> do

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.220 

okay<00:06:58.100> so<00:06:58.160> when<00:06:59.090> we<00:06:59.120> finish<00:06:59.450> that<00:06:59.480> verse<00:06:59.840> then

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
okay so when we finish that verse then

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.350 
okay so when we finish that verse then
we<00:07:00.320> go<00:07:01.100> into<00:07:01.220> the<00:07:01.400> chorus<00:07:01.790> then<00:07:02.060> we<00:07:02.150> go<00:07:02.270> into

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
we go into the chorus then we go into

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.960 
we go into the chorus then we go into
the<00:07:02.510> bridge<00:07:02.720> so<00:07:03.590> then<00:07:03.770> I<00:07:03.950> pulse

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970 
the bridge so then I pulse

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.920 
the bridge so then I pulse
it's<00:07:05.240> just<00:07:05.480> chords<00:07:05.720> again<00:07:05.840> like<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.110> chorus

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:38.990 

I'll<00:07:12.440> usually<00:07:12.620> do<00:07:12.830> a<00:07:12.860> walk<00:07:13.100> down

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.010 

then<00:07:40.000> they'll<00:07:40.150> go<00:07:40.270> after<00:07:40.480> that<00:07:40.750> they're<00:07:40.900> going

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020 
then they'll go after that they're going

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.310 
then they'll go after that they're going
to<00:07:41.080> go<00:07:41.200> into<00:07:41.320> a<00:07:41.500> drum<00:07:42.160> bridge<00:07:42.840> and<00:07:43.840> then<00:07:44.140> when

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.320 
to go into a drum bridge and then when

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.140 
to go into a drum bridge and then when
they<00:07:44.410> start<00:07:44.710> to<00:07:45.010> they'll<00:07:45.520> do<00:07:45.640> it<00:07:45.730> maybe<00:07:45.910> like<00:07:46.120> a

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.150 
they start to they'll do it maybe like a

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.360 
they start to they'll do it maybe like a
full<00:07:46.480> progression<00:07:46.960> through<00:07:47.230> and<00:07:47.650> then<00:07:48.010> again

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.370 
full progression through and then again
