out<00:00:49.260> today<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.829> how<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> works<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.610> galaxy

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
out today see how it works on my galaxy

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
out today see how it works on my galaxy
s6<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.260> let's<00:00:52.410> open<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:54.469> when<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> open<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
s6 so let's open it up when you open it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.229 
s6 so let's open it up when you open it
up<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.550> instruction<00:00:57.180> manual<00:00:59.239> see

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
up you get these instruction manual see

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.740 
up you get these instruction manual see
and<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.980> says<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.579> fisheye<00:01:03.210> lens<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and it says it's fisheye lens so that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
and it says it's fisheye lens so that
would<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> big<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.920> comes<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
would be the big one it comes with the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.260 
would be the big one it comes with the
lenses<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.790> here

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
lenses right here

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.440 
lenses right here
that's<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.380> fisheye<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> other<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.299> is

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that's the fisheye and the other one is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's the fisheye and the other one is
the<00:01:10.170> wide-angle<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.130> small<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.630> if

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the wide-angle the small one and then if

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.860 
the wide-angle the small one and then if
you<00:01:13.830> pull<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.220> apart

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
you pull it apart

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.800 
you pull it apart
we<00:01:15.990> try<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> focus<00:01:17.240> there<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.300> go<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.450> pull<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we try to focus there you go you pull it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.090 
we try to focus there you go you pull it
apart<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.410> this<00:01:19.740> one

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
apart on this one

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.000 
apart on this one
and<00:01:20.760> because<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.690> macro<00:01:22.020> lens<00:01:22.170> he<00:01:22.650> tells<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
and because the macro lens he tells you

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.750 
and because the macro lens he tells you
to<00:01:23.040> open<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.120> up<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> taking<00:01:26.190> apart<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> small

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
to open it up so taking apart the small

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.700 
to open it up so taking apart the small
one<00:01:26.940> this<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.690> give<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.170> macro<00:01:28.590> lens

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
one this one will give you a macro lens

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
one this one will give you a macro lens
all<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.460> let's<00:01:29.610> try<00:01:29.730> it<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.420> comes<00:01:30.540> with

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
all right let's try it out it comes with

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.140 
all right let's try it out it comes with
a<00:01:30.750> cloth<00:01:31.820> right<00:01:32.820> there

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150

pretty cool and these are the lenses so
let's<00:01:36.420> start<00:01:36.600> off<00:01:36.690> with<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> fisheye<00:01:37.560> wide

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
let's start off with the fisheye wide

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.620 
let's start off with the fisheye wide
fullscreen<00:01:39.150> lens<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:41.580> lens<00:01:41.940> feels<00:01:42.330> awesome

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
fullscreen lens this lens feels awesome

look at that you just clip it in there
it's<00:02:23.030> real<00:02:23.239> nice<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.599> let's<00:02:23.780> see<00:02:23.870> what<00:02:24.050> it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
it's real nice so let's see what it

it's real nice so let's see what it
gives<00:02:24.290> us<00:02:24.500> kind<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.010> view<00:02:25.190> again

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
gives us kind of view again

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.710 
gives us kind of view again
alright<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:26.569> this<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.110> fisheye

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
alright so this is the fisheye

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.410 
alright so this is the fisheye
widescreen<00:02:29.720> lens<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.910> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> hard<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
widescreen lens and it's kind of hard to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.720 
widescreen lens and it's kind of hard to
adjust<00:02:32.599> without<00:02:33.110> getting<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.470> black<00:02:33.739> corners

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
adjust without getting the black corners

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.759 
adjust without getting the black corners
you<00:02:34.970> see<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.360> sides<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.080> blurry<00:02:36.349> kind<00:02:36.680> of

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
you see the sides and the blurry kind of

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.460 
you see the sides and the blurry kind of
sides<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:37.970> did<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.750> for<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.080> second

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
sides but I did have it for a second

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.009 
sides but I did have it for a second
without<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.849> you<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.420> get<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> clearer

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
without it so you can get a clearer

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.220 
without it so you can get a clearer
image<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:44.030> looks<00:02:44.239> pretty<00:02:44.569> wide<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.959> me<00:02:45.079> it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
nice now we'll be trying on the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.289 
nice now we'll be trying on the
widescreen<00:03:33.920> Plus<00:03:34.920> macro<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.700> first<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
widescreen Plus macro so first it's the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
white screen they take apart for the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.849 
white screen they take apart for the
macro<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.879> this<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.510> without<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.260> lens<00:03:40.500> we're

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
macro so this is without the lens we're

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.259 
macro so this is without the lens we're
about<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.129> put<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.400> lens<00:03:41.609> on<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.090> we'll<00:03:42.239> see

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
about to put the lens on and we'll see

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.550 
about to put the lens on and we'll see
what<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.569> looks<00:03:42.599> like<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.019> take<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> good<00:03:43.410> look

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
