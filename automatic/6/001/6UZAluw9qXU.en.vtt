really really good I don't have to worry

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
really really good I don't have to worry
about<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> foundations<00:00:52.800> breaking<00:00:53.370> or

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
about the foundations breaking or

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
about the foundations breaking or
anything<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.600> spilling<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.170> over

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
anything like that or spilling all over

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
anything like that or spilling all over
so<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
so I really really like that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.889 
so I really really like that
um<00:00:57.590> one<00:00:58.590> thing<00:00:58.620> since<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> matte<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
um one thing since it is matte this is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
um one thing since it is matte this is
just<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> something<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just kind of something that's going on

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.840 
just kind of something that's going on
with<00:01:02.460> matte<00:01:02.670> foundations<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:05.100> tend<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
with matte foundations they can tend to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
with matte foundations they can tend to
clean<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.330> dry<00:01:06.570> patches<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
clean too dry patches but there's a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
clean too dry patches but there's a
really<00:01:08.340> easy<00:01:08.580> fix<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
really easy fix for that and that is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.670 
really easy fix for that and that is
just<00:01:11.400> adding<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> oil<00:01:12.680> for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
just adding a little bit of oil for

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.820 
just adding a little bit of oil for
example<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.760> use<00:01:15.030> argan<00:01:15.540> oil<00:01:15.780> sometimes<00:01:16.470> when

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
example I use argan oil sometimes when

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
example I use argan oil sometimes when
someone<00:01:17.280> has<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.610> dry<00:01:17.880> patches<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.420> their

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
someone has like dry patches on their

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.660 
someone has like dry patches on their
skin<00:01:18.869> even<00:01:19.229> after<00:01:19.619> moisturizing<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.430> stuff

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
skin even after moisturizing and stuff

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
skin even after moisturizing and stuff
I'll<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.509> add<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> argan<00:01:22.439> oil

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I'll just add a little bit of argan oil

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
I'll just add a little bit of argan oil
mix<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:23.850> you're<00:01:24.000> good<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
mix it in there and then you're good to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
mix it in there and then you're good to
go<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.750> easy<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> blend<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> these

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
go it's easy to blend out all of these

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
go it's easy to blend out all of these
are<00:01:26.250> super<00:01:26.700> creamy<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.150> although<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.720> sizes

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
are super creamy and although the sizes

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.710 
are super creamy and although the sizes
aren't<00:01:28.409> huge<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.299> right<00:01:30.479> size

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
aren't huge they're just the right size

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.899 
aren't huge they're just the right size
and<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.890> use<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> lot<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.640> little

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and you don't have to use a lot a little

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
and you don't have to use a lot a little
bit<00:01:33.030> goes<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.450> long<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.869> especially<00:01:34.740> when

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bit goes a very long way especially when

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
bit goes a very long way especially when
you<00:01:35.400> add<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> argan<00:01:36.090> oil<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> makes

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you add the argan oil because it makes

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710 
you add the argan oil because it makes
it<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.560> liquidy<00:01:38.100> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> foundation

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it more of a liquidy kind of foundation

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
it more of a liquidy kind of foundation
but<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.650> nice<00:01:40.890> having<00:01:41.159> them<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
but it's really nice having them in the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.359 
but it's really nice having them in the
