why<00:00:19.550> first<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.600> Kindle

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
why first of all I like the Kindle

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.939 
why first of all I like the Kindle
device<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:24.230> very<00:00:25.230> easy<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.680> read

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
device because it is very easy to read

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.759 
device because it is very easy to read
when<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.369> outdoors<00:00:26.930> not<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.230> much<00:00:28.470> with

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
when you're outdoors not so much with

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.880 
when you're outdoors not so much with
the<00:00:28.830> iPad<00:00:29.460> or<00:00:30.000> even<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.289> Kindle<00:00:31.710> HD<00:00:32.399> fire

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
the iPad or even the Kindle HD fire

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.560 
the iPad or even the Kindle HD fire
because<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.309> high<00:00:35.489> resolution<00:00:35.670> screen

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
because of the high resolution screen

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.200 
because of the high resolution screen
unless<00:00:37.500> you're<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.860> shade<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.940> very

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
unless you're in shade it's very

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.740 
unless you're in shade it's very
difficult<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:41.120> we<00:00:42.120> decided<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> go

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
difficult to see so we decided to go

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.290 
difficult to see so we decided to go
with<00:00:42.780> these<00:00:43.140> candles<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.969> what's<00:00:44.969> different

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
with these candles and what's different

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
with these candles and what's different
about<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.960> Kindle<00:00:46.379> paperwhite<00:00:46.579> couple

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
about the Kindle paperwhite couple

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.240 
about the Kindle paperwhite couple
things<00:00:47.760> first<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.899> it's

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
things first of all do you see that it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.889 
things first of all do you see that it's
got<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.489> backlight<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.570> thought<00:00:51.750> was

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
got a backlight which I thought was

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.689 
got a backlight which I thought was
great<00:00:52.730> because<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.230> dark

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
great because when you're in the dark

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
great because when you're in the dark
you<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> read<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.960> didn't<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you want to read if this didn't have the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
you want to read if this didn't have the
backlight<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.160> wouldn't<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.489> able<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> see

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
backlight you wouldn't be able to see

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
backlight you wouldn't be able to see
and<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.690> change<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> by<00:01:01.789> clicking

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and you can just change it by clicking

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
and you can just change it by clicking
up<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:03.930> light<00:01:04.110> bulb<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
up here to the little light bulb and you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.670 
up here to the little light bulb and you
can<00:01:04.949> change<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.519> brightness<00:01:08.930> okay<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.650> other

thing<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.159> liked<00:01:11.369> about<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.260> my<00:01:13.260> husband

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
thing I liked about this is my husband

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
thing I liked about this is my husband
had<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> hard<00:01:14.100> time<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.520> he's<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> real<00:01:15.000> reason

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
had a hard time and he's the real reason

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.039 
had a hard time and he's the real reason
why<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.630> changed<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:17.270> candles<00:01:18.270> because

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
why we changed out our candles because

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.600 
why we changed out our candles because
he<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.400> needs<00:01:20.610> bifocals<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.280> he<00:01:23.280> has

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
he really needs bifocals and he has

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
he really needs bifocals and he has
contacts<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.720> distance<00:01:25.189> but<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.430> would

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
contacts to see distance but he would

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.039 
contacts to see distance but he would
need<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.820> wear<00:01:26.970> readers<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:29.299> print<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
need to wear readers to see print so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.460 
need to wear readers to see print so
this<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.250> little<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.909> feature<00:01:33.840> which<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this has this little a feature which is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.260 
this has this little a feature which is
going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> allow<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.400> change<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:36.030> font

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
going to allow you to change your font

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.420 
going to allow you to change your font
size<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:36.930> go<00:01:37.259> tiny<00:01:38.479> or<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.689> go

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
size so you can go tiny or you can go

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.750

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
so that's kind of a really nice feature

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.020 
so that's kind of a really nice feature
and<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.110> got<00:01:51.290> some<00:01:51.470> other<00:01:51.680> things<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:52.850> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
standard Kendall doesn't have there's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.300 
standard Kendall doesn't have there's

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
this thing called x-ray if you want

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.730 
this thing called x-ray if you want
you're<00:01:59.180> reading<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.480> complicated<00:02:00.200> book<00:02:00.410> this

when you use this you are going to need

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.550 
when you use this you are going to need
a<00:04:06.650> converter<00:04:07.159> and<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:08.450> converter<00:04:08.810> what<00:04:09.349> all<00:04:09.530> I

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
a converter and the converter what all I

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.660 
a converter and the converter what all I
did<00:04:09.889> was<00:04:10.069> I<00:04:10.189> googled<00:04:10.639> how<00:04:11.269> do<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.569> convert

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
did was I googled how do you convert

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.670

worked for me really well and you can

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.050 
worked for me really well and you can
convert<00:04:33.349> it<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.560> then<00:04:33.860> load<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.610> up<00:04:34.759> on<00:04:34.940> your
