that I have done to increase my odds of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.899 
that I have done to increase my odds of
finding<00:00:39.719> chanterelles<00:00:40.589> today<00:00:40.979> is<00:00:41.280> pick<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909 
finding chanterelles today is pick the

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.910 
finding chanterelles today is pick the
time<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.659> the<00:00:42.929> season<00:00:43.229> that<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.440> grow<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.800> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
time or the season that they grow in I

secret behind this forest is I'm
surrounded<00:00:50.999> by<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.629> oak<00:00:52.170> trees<00:00:52.589> in

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
surrounded by a lot of oak trees in

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.009 
surrounded by a lot of oak trees in
these<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> believe<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.940> white<00:00:54.149> oak<00:00:54.329> trees<00:00:54.659> I

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
these I believe our white oak trees I

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.869 
these I believe our white oak trees I
have<00:00:55.710> some<00:00:55.920> leaves<00:00:56.159> here<00:00:58.459> there's<00:00:59.459> a<00:00:59.549> smaller

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have some leaves here there's a smaller

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.829 
have some leaves here there's a smaller
one<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:01.979> know<00:01:02.159> about<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.179> shame<00:01:03.359> about

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
one what we know about the shame about

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.200 
one what we know about the shame about
the<00:01:04.140> chanterelle<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.850> rest<00:01:06.030> or

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the chanterelle is that it is at rest or

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
the chanterelle is that it is at rest or
terrestrial<00:01:06.630> mushroom<00:01:07.409> first<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.190> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
terrestrial mushroom first of all so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.620 
terrestrial mushroom first of all so
you're<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> find<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> growing<00:01:09.450> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you're not going to find it growing on

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.070 
you're not going to find it growing on
dead<00:01:10.020> wood<00:01:10.580> or<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> sides<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.390> trees<00:01:12.660> where

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
dead wood or on the sides of trees where

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.300 
dead wood or on the sides of trees where
you're<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> find<00:01:13.620> it<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.830> growing<00:01:14.190> on

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you're going to find it is growing on

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.040 
you're going to find it is growing on
the<00:01:14.430> ground<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.300> grows<00:01:15.510> on<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.810> ground

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
the ground it grows on the ground

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.350 
the ground it grows on the ground
because<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.530> connected<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.220> these<00:01:17.760> kinds<00:01:18.300> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because it's connected to these kinds of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
because it's connected to these kinds of
trees<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:18.810> Oaks<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.440> what's<00:01:19.920> called<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
trees these Oaks in what's called the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420 
trees these Oaks in what's called the
mycorrhizal<00:01:20.990> relationship<00:01:22.340> it's<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
mycorrhizal relationship it's a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
mycorrhizal relationship it's a
symbiotic<00:01:23.790> relationship<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> tree<00:01:25.080> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
symbiotic relationship where the tree is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
symbiotic relationship where the tree is
helping<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> mushroom<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> mushroom<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
helping the mushroom in the mushroom is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.960 
helping the mushroom in the mushroom is
helping<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.480> tree<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:29.160> I've<00:01:29.520> increased<00:01:29.820> my

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
helping the tree so I've increased my

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.520 
helping the tree so I've increased my
odds<00:01:30.210> by<00:01:30.360> looking<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.810> an<00:01:30.900> area<00:01:31.200> where<00:01:31.350> there's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
odds by looking in an area where there's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.680 
odds by looking in an area where there's
an<00:01:31.650> abundance<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.810> these<00:01:33.810> trees<00:01:38.090> I'm<00:01:39.090> starting

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
an abundance of these trees I'm starting

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.390 
an abundance of these trees I'm starting
to<00:01:39.720> find<00:01:40.050> some<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.760> this<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> reason<00:01:42.540> why

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
to find some and this is the reason why

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.180 
to find some and this is the reason why
not<00:01:44.400> only<00:01:44.580> do<00:01:44.760> these<00:01:44.880> things<00:01:45.180> taste<00:01:45.570> amazing

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
not only do these things taste amazing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.740 
not only do these things taste amazing
but<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.580> other<00:01:47.700> reason<00:01:47.909> I've<00:01:48.330> spent

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
but this is the other reason I've spent

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
but this is the other reason I've spent
hours<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.440> hours<00:01:49.560> looking<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.100> morels<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
hours and hours looking for morels and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.000 
hours and hours looking for morels and
other<00:01:50.880> kinds<00:01:51.300> of<00:01:51.420> mushrooms<00:01:51.600> morels<00:01:52.590> tend<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
other kinds of mushrooms morels tend to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.399 
other kinds of mushrooms morels tend to
blend<00:01:53.220> into<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> environment<00:01:54.290> when<00:01:55.290> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
blend into the environment when you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.320 
blend into the environment when you
start<00:01:55.710> finding<00:01:56.070> kin<00:01:56.640> Tourelles<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.940> can<00:02:00.090> see

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
start finding kin Tourelles you can see

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.390 
start finding kin Tourelles you can see
how<00:02:00.540> easy<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:01.140> becomes<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
how easy it becomes they just kind of

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.390 
how easy it becomes they just kind of
here's<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.030> small<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.930> nice<00:02:04.860> golden

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
here's a small one here nice golden

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.460 
here's a small one here nice golden
yellowish<00:02:05.820> color<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:07.140> look<00:02:07.260> at<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
yellowish color and then look at this

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.690 
yellowish color and then look at this
I'm<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.740> even<00:02:07.920> looking<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.280> hard<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> was

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I'm not even looking very hard I was

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.070 
I'm not even looking very hard I was
