then and Hoenn or the emerald sapphire
drew<00:00:25.830> B<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.400> Taillow<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.570> so

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
drew B it was Taillow and so on so

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
drew B it was Taillow and so on so
anyway<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.529> he<00:00:28.800> actually<00:00:28.949> changed<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
anyway but he actually changed the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.339 
anyway but he actually changed the
formula<00:00:29.699> completely<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.779> he's<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.050> just

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
formula completely but he's not just

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
formula completely but he's not just
flying<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.769> normal<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> them<00:00:32.850> are

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
flying a normal like a lot of them are

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.580 
flying a normal like a lot of them are
like<00:00:33.540> Pidgey

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
like Pidgey

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
like Pidgey
to<00:00:34.890> start<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> did<00:00:36.059> pitchy

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
to start you know what you did pitchy

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
to start you know what you did pitchy
he's<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> reason<00:00:37.110> why<00:00:37.320> every<00:00:37.800> freaking

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
he's the reason why every freaking

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.030 
he's the reason why every freaking
flying<00:00:38.370> type<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.879> normal<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> flying

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
flying type is not normal and flying

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
flying type is not normal and flying
anyway<00:00:41.040> let's<00:00:41.219> get<00:00:41.340> past<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.790> uh<00:00:42.030> he's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
anyway let's get past that uh he's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
anyway let's get past that uh he's
firing<00:00:42.840> flying<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.379> he<00:00:43.440> changed<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> formula

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
firing flying so he changed the formula

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
firing flying so he changed the formula
completely<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.480> but

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
completely and I really like that but

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.750 
completely and I really like that but
there's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> huge<00:00:46.680> combination<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> makes<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there's a huge combination it makes it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.950 
there's a huge combination it makes it
where<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.090> take<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.480> steel<00:00:48.719> types

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
where he can just take out steel types

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
where he can just take out steel types
and<00:00:49.140> fighting<00:00:49.410> types<00:00:49.620> he's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> lot<00:00:50.640> more

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and fighting types he's a lot more

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.319 
and fighting types he's a lot more
useful<00:00:51.000> than<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> normal<00:00:51.870> flying<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> anyway

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
useful than a normal flying so anyway

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
useful than a normal flying so anyway
yeah<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.590> is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
but like other than that even if it's
just<00:01:30.840> normally<00:01:31.290> effective<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.189> gonna

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
just normally effective it's also gonna

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
just normally effective it's also gonna
take<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.030> hits<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
take it out one or two hits I know the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
take it out one or two hits I know the
only<00:01:34.110> problem<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.680> brain<00:01:35.070> bird

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
only problem with that is brain bird

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.520 
only problem with that is brain bird
definitely<00:01:35.850> does<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.210> recoil<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.990> that's<00:01:37.350> why

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
definitely does do recoil and that's why

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.539 
definitely does do recoil and that's why
I<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.189> people<00:01:38.430> who<00:01:38.490> actually

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
I don't like some people who actually

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.420 
I don't like some people who actually
roll<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:40.290> life<00:01:40.770> form<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> very

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
roll this with life form that is very

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
roll this with life form that is very
dumb<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.240> opinion<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.960> hurt

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
dumb in my opinion but then you get hurt

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
dumb in my opinion but then you get hurt
twice<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.490> killing

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
twice so you pretty much killing

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.370 
twice so you pretty much killing
yourself<00:01:45.240> especially<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.170> against

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
yourself especially if you go against

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
yourself especially if you go against
something<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.710> Chauncey<00:01:47.280> which<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.790> what

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
something like a Chauncey which is what

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
something like a Chauncey which is what
I'd<00:01:48.210> intestine<00:01:48.720> braver<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.369> since<00:01:50.369> they

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
I'd intestine braver it on since they

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'd intestine braver it on since they
have<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:50.939> health<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:52.470> recoil<00:01:53.189> for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
have so much health you get recoil for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
have so much health you get recoil for
how<00:01:53.430> much<00:01:53.549> health<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.060> down<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> since

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
how much health you take down and since

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.319 
how much health you take down and since

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you take so much of chancy's you go down

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
you take so much of chancy's you go down
pretty<00:01:57.570> much<00:01:57.719> almost<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.170> half<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.250> one

know what that is depending which makes

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.900 
know what that is depending which makes
it<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.500> he<00:02:10.590> goes<00:02:10.800> first<00:02:11.129> which<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it where he goes first which it really

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
it where he goes first which it really
doesn't<00:02:12.239> matter<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.780> gale<00:02:12.959> wings<00:02:13.230> but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
doesn't matter if is of gale wings but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.840 
doesn't matter if is of gale wings but
that's

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
that's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.850 
that's
flying<00:02:14.150> moves<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.990> since<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.350> roll<00:02:15.560> him<00:02:15.740> with

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
flying moves but since I roll him with

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.640 
flying moves but since I roll him with
flare<00:02:16.100> blitz<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:17.510> both<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.990> them<00:02:18.140> actually<00:02:18.560> on

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
flare blitz on both of them actually on

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.840 
flare blitz on both of them actually on
all<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.890> my<00:02:19.010> Lauren<00:02:19.250> just<00:02:19.370> flare<00:02:19.640> blitz

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
all that my Lauren just flare blitz

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.000 
all that my Lauren just flare blitz
brave<00:02:20.240> bird<00:02:20.480> ruched<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:20.990> u-turn<00:02:21.320> usually

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
brave bird ruched in u-turn usually

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.850 
brave bird ruched in u-turn usually
ruched<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.660> switched<00:02:23.660> out<00:02:23.810> with<00:02:23.900> tailwind<00:02:24.620> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
ruched is switched out with tailwind I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.040 
ruched is switched out with tailwind I
think<00:02:25.760> that's<00:02:25.880> what<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.120> called<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.780> makes

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
think that's what it's called it makes

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.540 
think that's what it's called it makes
it<00:02:27.170> were<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:27.500> four<00:02:27.830> four<00:02:28.010> moves<00:02:28.250> your<00:02:28.430> whole

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
it were just four four moves your whole

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.820 
it were just four four moves your whole
team's<00:02:28.790> speed<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.480> better<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.230> go<00:02:30.410> first

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
team's speed is better so you go first

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.370 
team's speed is better so you go first
um<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.880> yet<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.390> usually<00:02:32.750> choice<00:02:32.960> car<00:02:33.230> from

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
um but yet I usually choice car from

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.020 
um but yet I usually choice car from
just<00:02:33.530> because<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:34.220> makes<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.460> relatable<00:02:34.550> it's

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
just because it makes it relatable it's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.780 
just because it makes it relatable it's
is<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.210> lot<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.810> useful<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.280> it's<00:02:37.490> all<00:02:37.640> you're

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
is a lot more useful so it's all you're

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.730 
is a lot more useful so it's all you're
also<00:02:37.880> gonna<00:02:38.060> see<00:02:38.240> him<00:02:38.600> taking<00:02:38.960> down<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.230> grande

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
also gonna see him taking down a grande

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.010 
also gonna see him taking down a grande
or<00:02:39.890> flavor<00:02:40.070> blitz<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:41.270> he<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.570> take<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.870> a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
or flavor blitz and he can take that a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.240 
or flavor blitz and he can take that a
ground<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.380> two<00:02:42.530> hits<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:42.950> top<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
ground in two hits and on top of that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.010 
ground in two hits and on top of that
flat<00:02:43.490> but<00:02:43.610> says<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> chance<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.120> burn<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:44.870> if<00:02:44.930> you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
flat but says a chance to burn so if you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.080 
flat but says a chance to burn so if you
burned<00:02:45.320> him<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.980> first<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.910> could

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
burned him in the first one you could

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.130 
burned him in the first one you could
pretty<00:02:47.210> much<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.510> switch<00:02:47.720> him<00:02:47.870> out<00:02:47.990> but

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
pretty much just switch him out but

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.600 
pretty much just switch him out but
everyone's<00:02:48.500> gonna<00:02:48.620> die<00:02:48.740> no<00:02:48.860> matter<00:02:49.070> what<00:02:49.220> I

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
everyone's gonna die no matter what I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.040 
everyone's gonna die no matter what I
