number on the battery is bh 6x instead

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.889 
number on the battery is bh 6x instead
of<00:00:53.940> 5x<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.899> 1500

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of 5x this one right here is 1500

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
of 5x this one right here is 1500
milliamp<00:00:59.120> hours<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.609> right<00:01:02.760> here

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
milliamp hours and this one right here

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.960 
milliamp hours and this one right here
the<00:01:03.149> 6x<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.189> 300<00:01:05.189> more<00:01:05.630> milliamp<00:01:06.630> hour<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.290> it's

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the 6x is 300 more milliamp hour so it's

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.700 
the 6x is 300 more milliamp hour so it's
1800<00:01:08.970> um<00:01:11.810> let<00:01:12.810> me<00:01:12.869> compare<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.000> can

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
1800 um let me compare these if I can

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
1800 um let me compare these if I can
I'll<00:01:16.710> set<00:01:16.979> them<00:01:17.040> both<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.580> side<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I'll set them both on the side of the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
I'll set them both on the side of the
table<00:01:18.330> I'll<00:01:18.950> get<00:01:19.950> back<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:22.430> okay<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:26.189> i

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
table I'll get back here okay so if i

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.840 
table I'll get back here okay so if i
send<00:01:26.369> them<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:26.880> side<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.570> side<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
send them right side by side this one is

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.670 
send them right side by side this one is
probably<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:31.110> 6x<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.880> about<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> millimeter

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
probably the 6x is about a millimeter

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.660 
probably the 6x is about a millimeter
taller<00:01:34.680> than<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.060> other<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.520> let's<00:01:38.520> look

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
taller than the other one and let's look

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.859 
taller than the other one and let's look
at<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> cases<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.939> see<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> curve<00:01:42.600> on

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
at the cases as you can see the curve on

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.550 
at the cases as you can see the curve on
the<00:01:43.170> 6<00:01:43.560> x<00:01:43.770> 1<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.610> steep<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:46.170> 5x

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the 6 x 1 is not as steep as the 5x

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
the 6 x 1 is not as steep as the 5x
better<00:01:47.479> these<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.049> any<00:01:49.649> higher<00:01:50.340> but

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
better these do not look any higher but

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
better these do not look any higher but
the<00:01:51.479> 6x<00:01:52.049> does<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.649> longer<00:01:53.780> legs<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.640> so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the 6x does have longer legs on it so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.870 
the 6x does have longer legs on it so
and<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.240> use<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.290> 5x<00:02:01.829> battery<00:02:02.399> back<00:02:02.640> on

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and you can use the 5x battery back on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.730 
and you can use the 5x battery back on
the<00:02:03.689> 6x<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.469> use<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> stock

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
the 6x so you can use a stock

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.100 
the 6x so you can use a stock
battery<00:02:09.670> back<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.630> extended<00:02:11.080> battery

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
battery back with the extended battery

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.680 
battery back with the extended battery
it's<00:02:11.530> just<00:02:11.710> tight<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:13.000> believe<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.510> does

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
it's just tight and I believe it does

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.590 
it's just tight and I believe it does
say<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.590> only<00:02:14.920> use<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:16.050> with<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.790> 5x<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
say you only use this with the 5x but it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.260 
say you only use this with the 5x but it
is<00:02:20.020> tight<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.620> don't<00:02:20.920> use<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.280> i<00:02:21.400> use<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
is tight I don't use it i use the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.170 
is tight I don't use it i use the
extended<00:02:23.020> battery<00:02:23.050> back<00:02:23.500> cover<00:02:23.550> because<00:02:24.550> i<00:02:24.580> do

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
extended battery back cover because i do

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.670 
extended battery back cover because i do
have<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.500> case<00:02:26.500> i<00:02:26.740> put<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.270> in<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.320> this

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
have a case i put on so in it and this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.260 
have a case i put on so in it and this
if<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.130> case<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:31.090> kind

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
if you have a case like this it's kind

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.480 
if you have a case like this it's kind
of<00:02:31.300> like<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.450> rubbery<00:02:32.640> plastic<00:02:33.640> i<00:02:34.180> guess<00:02:34.540> um

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
of like a rubbery plastic i guess um

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.190 
of like a rubbery plastic i guess um
it'll<00:02:36.490> not<00:02:37.210> be<00:02:37.450> any<00:02:37.720> different<00:02:37.960> um<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.600> here<00:02:41.020> I

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it'll not be any different um so here I

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.600 
it'll not be any different um so here I
here<00:02:42.960> I'll<00:02:43.960> put<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.410> case<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.490> can

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
here I'll put this case on so you can

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.340 
here I'll put this case on so you can
see<00:02:45.760> how<00:02:45.790> much<00:02:46.000> thicker<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:49.170> can't<00:02:50.170> why

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.260 
see how much thicker it is I can't why
i'm<00:02:50.470> looking<00:02:50.800> through<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> camera<00:02:51.250> actually

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270

higher than the rest of the back and the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
other one wouldn't be as I said it is a

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.059 
other one wouldn't be as I said it is a
little<00:03:33.480> thicker<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.470> don't<00:03:34.530> notice<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
big difference that is mostly because I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.140 
big difference that is mostly because I
have<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.450> time<00:03:39.989> right<00:03:40.230> cup<00:03:40.980> run<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.400> too<00:03:41.610> so
