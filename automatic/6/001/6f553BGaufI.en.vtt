00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
 If you are in some kind of room, 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.067
 I encourage you now to make a small experiment. 

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:06.900
 Look around the room and see if there is anything in it, 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.960
 which is made of wood or paper or fabric, 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.840
 and was in the room for a while, 

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:15.933
 so I hope it's at room temperature. 

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.139
 And then found something else that was made of metal, 

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:20.368
 who has been in the room for some time 

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.100
 and does not have its own energy source, 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.360
 so do not use your computer. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640
 It has to be something that passively stays in your room for some time, 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.160
 not too hard to find one. 

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:29.068
 Touch both of them. 

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:32.500
 And you'll see that even though they both stayed for a while in this room, 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 the metal will be much colder. 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.220
 You will feel that the metal is colder. 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.100
 And this is a little confusing, 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.480
 because they both stayed in this room for some time, 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.280
 so both must have room temperature. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.120
 Let's do that a bit more accurately. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.340
 Let's say the room temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.700
 And the key reason to be colder is, 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.560
 that the room temperature is lower than your body temperature. 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.820
 Your body temperature will be approximately 37 degrees Celsius. 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.420
 Let me write this - it's body temperature. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.780
 And the surface temperature of your skin may be slightly different than that, 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.900
 but let's just assume it's about 37 degrees Celsius. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.480
 And this metal, this metal surface is not actually colder. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.060
 In fact, there is no lower average kinetic energy than the wood surface. 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.940
 They both stayed in this room for a while, 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.880
 both have a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.218
 What happened? 

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:42.515
 Why your skin and your brain 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.580
 does the metal feel colder? 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.693
 And the simple answer is that he is better 

00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:50.383
 in removing heat from you. 

00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.610
 Why is it better to take heat from me? 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.093
 Let's just imagine, let's say, 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.040
 that this is the atoms on the surface of my skin. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.540
 These are the atoms on the surface of my skin, 

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.237
 the lower part of my skin, say my hand 

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:11.024
 touching one surface here. 

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:12.380
 This is my thumb here 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.578
 and touch the surface. 

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:16.342
 And there will be average kinetic energy, 

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.012
 which will be in terms of my body temperature 

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:21.821
 37 degrees Celsius. 

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:27.800
 These things will bounce around or vibrate around. 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.380
 And perhaps the covalent bonds between carbon atoms 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.620
 and the other atoms of my skin 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.000
 do not allow them to free themselves completely, 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.620
 but they will tremble, will bounce around. 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.680
 And even push each other 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.662
 and this can be done by electrostatic forces. 

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:50.401
 But they will have some average kinetic energy. 

00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:54.120
 And let's say my hand touches both surfaces at the same time. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:02.740
 I have this wood surface, I will do this in yellow. 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.600
 I have the wooden surface here. 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.235
 This is a tree. 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.509
 And I have this metal surface - I'll do that in white. 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.520
 I have the metal surface here. 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.340
 And this metal surface - we've already talked about it - 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.920
 it will feel colder. 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.880
 Let me draw the rest of my hand. 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.060
 The rest of my hand - you get the idea. 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.154
 What is going on here? 

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:32.265
 Let's think about it at a microscopic level. 

00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:35.040
 First, the surface of the tree will be uneven. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880
 You will have atoms here, but you will have gaps, 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.700
 there will be air here. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.740
 Let me roll a little down. 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.004
 It will be like this - 

00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:49.718
 you will have gaps. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.080
 And there will be internal gaps, that's right. 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.020
 This will be the tree, 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.200
 while the metal is much thicker. 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.019
 And the surface is much smoother. 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.711
 The metal - let's make the metal in that white color - 

00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:14.841
 the atoms of the metal are much more crowded. 

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:19.183
 It is much thicker, the surface is smoother, 

00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:22.642
 there are no internal air pockets, 

00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.940
 there will be no air pockets in it. 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.542
 What will happen? 

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:31.920
 We always said, you'll have a heat transfer 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.760
 from the higher temperature system, 

00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:36.295
 or something with a higher temperature, 

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:37.526
 to the lower temperature. 

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:40.057
 They will already have some kinetic energy, 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.800
 these things will have average kinetic energy, 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.880
 which corresponds to 22 degrees Celsius. 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.320
 Let's draw some of these arrows. 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.260
 So it is here too - they will have it 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.960
 the same average kinetic energy. 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.940
 These things are pushed around, pushing one another 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.092
 with electrostatic forces. 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.980
 I hope this gives you an idea of â€‹â€‹what's going on. 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.059
 But my hand is warmer, 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.288
 my arm has a higher average kinetic energy. 

00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:13.631
 The atoms and molecules of my hand 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.780
 will hit the atoms and molecules of the tree 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.800
 and will transfer kinetic energy. 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.240
 But we realize that the tree makes weaker contact. 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.840
 Because first, the surface of the tree is not smooth, 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.600
 that is, it touches less. 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.260
 This here can simply crash with another air particle, 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.300
 will not crash into a piece of wood. 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.420
 But some of the particles of the tree will begin 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.219
 to take kinetic energy from me. 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.308
 And I will feel this as a chill. 

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:42.841
 Maybe it takes a little kinetic energy, 

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.300
 it's getting stuck in that. 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.717
 The kinetic energy is transferred down. 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.000
 But it will be rolled down much slower, 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.800
 than it will happen in the metal. 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.440
 Because first, I do not have so much surface contact 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.860
 between my hand and the tree, 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.097
 due to all these gaps. 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.720
 And in the tree I also have air pockets. 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.840
 And overall, the tree is not so tight. 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.380
 There will be less collisions and it will take longer 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.920
 this energy is transferred from my hand. 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.020
 And the metal, on the other hand, 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.500
 as soon as this atom crashes into this one, 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.760
 it will crash into this, it will crash into this one, 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.400
 this will crash into this one. 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.260
 And this kinetic energy will very quickly be dragged down the metal. 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.180
 He can take more heat than me. 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.900
 This molecule here will get 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.940
 some kinetic energy from a molecule in my hand. 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.480
 But then she'll hit her neighbor 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.200
 and will transfer this kinetic energy. 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.741
 He will lose his kinetic energy quite quickly 

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:48.060
 and is ready to be struck again by another molecule from my hand, 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.700
 and take more kinetic energy. 

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:52.889
 I will take heat from me faster. 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.680
 You have a faster energy transfer, 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.220
 than you have with the tree. 

00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:02.966
 And from the point of view of your body, 

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:06.480
 that this heat is taken away faster than you, 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.180
 although both surfaces are actually of the same temperature, 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:21.400
 your body perceives this here as colder.
