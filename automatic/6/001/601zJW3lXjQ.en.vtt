baseline consistent triplets all the way

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.260 
baseline consistent triplets all the way
through<00:01:06.979> which<00:01:07.220> triplets<00:01:07.670> can<00:01:07.909> be<00:01:08.000> kind<00:01:08.210> of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
through which triplets can be kind of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.520 
through which triplets can be kind of
cool<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.540> work<00:01:08.900> on<00:01:09.080> your<00:01:09.170> right<00:01:09.320> hand

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
cool to work on your right hand

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.410 
cool to work on your right hand
alternating<00:01:10.040> because<00:01:10.310> basically<00:01:10.580> if<00:01:11.210> you're

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
alternating because basically if you're

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.390 
alternating because basically if you're
using<00:01:11.570> two<00:01:11.870> fingers<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.440> pluck<00:01:12.620> with<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.280> have

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
using two fingers to pluck with you have

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920 
using two fingers to pluck with you have
three<00:01:13.670> notes<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.420> got<00:01:14.659> to<00:01:14.690> be<00:01:14.810> very

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
three notes and so you got to be very

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.510 
three notes and so you got to be very
consistent<00:01:15.560> with<00:01:15.680> you're<00:01:15.860> alternating<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.430> be

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
consistent with you're alternating to be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.000 
consistent with you're alternating to be
able<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.729> be<00:01:16.850> smooth<00:01:17.210> with<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.710> but<00:01:18.710> really

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
able to be smooth with it but really

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.830 
able to be smooth with it but really
what<00:01:19.190> I'm<00:01:19.280> owed<00:01:19.430> isolate<00:01:19.850> here<00:01:20.120> is<00:01:20.510> what<00:01:20.659> some

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
what I'm owed isolate here is what some

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.660 
what I'm owed isolate here is what some
people<00:01:20.870> call<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.290> four<00:01:21.590> plus<00:01:21.860> one<00:01:22.010> fingering

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
people call the four plus one fingering

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.660 
people call the four plus one fingering
pattern<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.770> lot<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:24.979> bassline<00:01:25.400> can<00:01:25.580> be

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
pattern a lot of the bassline can be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.820 
pattern a lot of the bassline can be
played<00:01:25.909> in<00:01:26.240> fourth<00:01:26.900> position<00:01:27.080> which<00:01:27.500> means<00:01:27.740> my

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
played in fourth position which means my

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.920 
played in fourth position which means my
index<00:01:28.250> finger<00:01:28.490> goes<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.850> fourth<00:01:29.090> fret<00:01:29.360> middle

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
index finger goes the fourth fret middle

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.870 
index finger goes the fourth fret middle
finger<00:01:30.170> covers<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.530> fifth<00:01:30.770> ring<00:01:31.220> covers<00:01:31.610> six

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
finger covers the fifth ring covers six

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.210 
finger covers the fifth ring covers six
and<00:01:32.119> sevenths<00:01:32.479> cover<00:01:32.659> both<00:01:32.869> pinky<00:01:33.229> however

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
and sevenths cover both pinky however

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.280 
and sevenths cover both pinky however
there<00:01:34.580> are<00:01:34.760> times<00:01:35.150> when<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.479> need<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.750> reach<00:01:35.990> out

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
there are times when I need to reach out

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.680 
there are times when I need to reach out
to<00:01:36.619> get<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.920> C<00:01:37.130> or<00:01:37.549> reach<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.150> get<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.450> G

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
to get the C or reach out to get the G

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.500 
to get the C or reach out to get the G
so<00:01:39.140> I'm<00:01:39.260> playing<00:01:39.470> four<00:01:39.920> fingers<00:01:40.400> for<00:01:40.880> one

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
so I'm playing four fingers for one

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.090 
so I'm playing four fingers for one
finger<00:01:41.750> per<00:01:41.780> fret<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.350> fourth<00:01:42.590> fret<00:01:42.770> area

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
finger per fret in a fourth fret area

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.719 
finger per fret in a fourth fret area
plus<00:01:43.760> one<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.740> know<00:01:45.860> instead<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.640> like

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
moving your whole hand which can create

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.340 
moving your whole hand which can create

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.929 
that sound on recordings you just got to
get<00:01:51.409> used<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.680> reaching<00:01:52.100> over<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.549> cleanly

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
get used to reaching over and cleanly

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.850 
get used to reaching over and cleanly
getting<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.360> note<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.170> that's<00:01:54.380> what<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.680> is

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
getting that note so that's what this is

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.399 
getting that note so that's what this is
working<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:55.540> it's<00:01:56.540> really<00:01:56.720> quite<00:01:57.020> simple<00:01:57.200> you

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
working on it's really quite simple you

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.190 
working on it's really quite simple you
know<00:01:57.560> starts<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:57.979> an<00:01:58.100> opening<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:59.200> seventh

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
know starts with an opening a seventh

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.620 
know starts with an opening a seventh
fret<00:02:00.380> octave<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.340> D<00:02:01.490> string<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:03.380> G

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
fret octave a on the D string to the G

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.230 
fret octave a on the D string to the G
and<00:02:05.049> then<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.320> play<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.860> F<00:02:06.159> sharp<00:02:06.490> G<00:02:06.700> F<00:02:07.210> sharp

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
and then you play the F sharp G F sharp

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.719 
and then you play the F sharp G F sharp
or<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.140> fourth<00:02:08.440> fret<00:02:08.740> fifth<00:02:09.100> fret<00:02:09.190> fourth

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
or the fourth fret fifth fret fourth

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.309 
or the fourth fret fifth fret fourth
fret<00:02:09.789> now<00:02:10.330> let's<00:02:10.509> play<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.929> because<00:02:11.200> that

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
fret now let's play that because that

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.990 
fret now let's play that because that
record<00:02:11.680> that's<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.220> first<00:02:12.490> measure<00:02:12.730> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
record that's in the first measure and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.550 
record that's in the first measure and
the<00:02:13.180> third<00:02:13.390> measure<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.140> repeatable

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
the third measure so it's a repeatable

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.729 
the third measure so it's a repeatable
groove<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.709> that's<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:19.380> I'd<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.650> to

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
groove so that's it I'd like you to

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.890 
groove so that's it I'd like you to
focus<00:02:20.890> on<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.310> left<00:02:21.489> hand<00:02:21.610> some<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.750> might

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
focus on the left hand some of you might

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.320 
focus on the left hand some of you might
initially<00:02:23.140> try<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.500> play<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:27.330> and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
initially try to play like this and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.910 
initially try to play like this and
that's<00:02:28.420> really<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.840> mean<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.319> might<00:02:29.470> work<00:02:29.650> fine

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
that's really I mean it might work fine

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.470 
that's really I mean it might work fine
but<00:02:30.160> it's<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.489> unnecessary<00:02:30.730> movement

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
but it's kind of unnecessary movement

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.690 
but it's kind of unnecessary movement
and<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.680> got<00:02:32.890> four<00:02:33.160> fingers<00:02:33.370> let's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
and you know you got four fingers let's

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370 
and you know you got four fingers let's
work<00:02:33.880> all<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.239> them<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.720> if<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.870> put<00:02:35.110> playing

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
work all of them out so if I put playing

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.530 
work all of them out so if I put playing
the<00:02:35.590> octave<00:02:36.069> with<00:02:36.400> your<00:02:36.520> pinky<00:02:36.940> your<00:02:37.269> hands

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
the octave with your pinky your hands

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.590 
the octave with your pinky your hands
set<00:02:37.690> up<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.440> really<00:02:38.680> cleanly<00:02:38.980> play<00:02:39.280> they're

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.300 

now<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.660> measure<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.260> starts<00:02:44.830> with<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.100> same

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
now a measure to starts with the same

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.180 
now a measure to starts with the same
root<00:02:45.640> an<00:02:45.790> octave<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.650> play<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> run

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
root an octave but then I play a run

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.199 
root an octave but then I play a run
that<00:02:48.400> goes<00:02:48.610> c<00:02:48.910> d<00:02:49.269> e<00:02:49.300> f<00:02:49.870> sharp<00:02:50.230> B<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.800> or<00:02:51.209> three

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
that goes c d e f sharp B a or three

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.860 
that goes c d e f sharp B a or three
five<00:02:52.660> seven<00:02:53.140> four<00:02:54.040> five<00:02:54.459> seven<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.720> might

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
five seven four five seven and you might

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.479 
five seven four five seven and you might
just<00:02:55.959> want<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.200> loop<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.709> for<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.980> little<00:03:02.489> now

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
just want to loop that for a little now

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.050 
just want to loop that for a little now
going<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.590> measure<00:03:05.590> four<00:03:05.980> that's<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.790> only

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
going on to measure four that's the only

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.280 
going on to measure four that's the only
measure<00:03:07.239> where<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.630> don't<00:03:07.810> start<00:03:08.019> with<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
measure where we don't start with the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.690 
measure where we don't start with the
root<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.620> octave<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.430> play<00:03:09.670> a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
root and the octave but we do play a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.550 
root and the octave but we do play a
descending<00:03:10.239> line<00:03:10.420> starting<00:03:10.959> on<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.230> seventh

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
descending line starting on the seventh

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.160 
descending line starting on the seventh
fret<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.100> go<00:03:12.220> seven<00:03:12.760> five<00:03:13.060> four<00:03:13.510> seven

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
fret and we go seven five four seven

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.250 
fret and we go seven five four seven
five<00:03:14.440> four<00:03:14.860> seven<00:03:15.579> five<00:03:15.850> three<00:03:16.450> seven<00:03:16.810> five

five four seven five three seven five

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.440 
five four seven five three seven five
three<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:21.489> all<00:03:21.670> together<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:22.120> sounds<00:03:22.150> like

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
three so all together it sounds like

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:30.199 
three so all together it sounds like
this

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.970 

practice<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.360> very<00:03:31.390> slowly<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.290> mean<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.769> know

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
practice it very slowly I mean I I know

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.619 
practice it very slowly I mean I I know
I<00:03:33.129> just<00:03:33.459> beating<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.879> dead<00:03:34.030> horse<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.420> always

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
I just beating a dead horse I always

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.630 
I just beating a dead horse I always
tell<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.049> start<00:03:35.319> very<00:03:35.590> slowly<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.459> that

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
tell you to start very slowly but that

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.670 
tell you to start very slowly but that
is<00:03:36.730> where<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.299> race<00:03:37.629> is<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:38.049> is<00:03:38.349> if<00:03:38.590> you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
is where the race is one is if you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.890 
is where the race is one is if you
practice<00:03:39.159> consistently<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.180> slow<00:03:40.599> tempo

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
practice consistently a slow tempo

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.569 
practice consistently a slow tempo
hopefully<00:03:41.709> with<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.860> click<00:03:42.099> track<00:03:42.250> drum

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
hopefully with a click track drum

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.369 
hopefully with a click track drum
machine<00:03:42.819> or<00:03:43.000> something<00:03:43.180> like<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.900> you

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
machine or something like that and you

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.289 
machine or something like that and you
really<00:03:44.590> isolate<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.549> technique<00:03:45.909> make<00:03:46.150> sure

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
really isolate the technique make sure

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.270 
really isolate the technique make sure
you<00:03:46.390> try<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.659> get<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.930> rid<00:03:47.439> of<00:03:47.590> as<00:03:47.680> many<00:03:47.829> buzzes

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
you try to get it rid of as many buzzes

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.890 
you try to get it rid of as many buzzes
and<00:03:48.430> rattles<00:03:48.790> as<00:03:48.909> possible<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.569> then

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
and rattles as possible and then

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.020 
and rattles as possible and then
gradually<00:03:50.650> increase<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.280> tempo<00:03:51.609> I<00:03:51.790> think

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
gradually increase the tempo I think

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.429 
gradually increase the tempo I think
you're<00:03:52.120> going<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.299> be<00:03:52.390> more<00:03:52.510> encouraged<00:03:53.019> if

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
you're going to be more encouraged if

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.500 
you're going to be more encouraged if
