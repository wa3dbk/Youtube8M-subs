on<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> peg<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:07.190> just<00:01:07.520> created<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.180> wrap

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
on the peg and you just created a wrap

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.100 
on the peg and you just created a wrap
on<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:09.110> peg<00:01:09.970> by<00:01:10.970> wrapping<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.540> peg<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.960> have

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
on that peg by wrapping the peg you have

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.410 
on that peg by wrapping the peg you have
eliminated<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.860> hole<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:13.729> let's<00:01:14.000> go<00:01:14.270> ahead

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
eliminated a hole so now let's go ahead

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.100 
eliminated a hole so now let's go ahead
and<00:01:14.870> do<00:01:15.320> row<00:01:16.220> number<00:01:16.580> four<00:01:16.820> which<00:01:17.270> tells<00:01:17.659> us<00:01:17.900> to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
and do row number four which tells us to

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.219 
and do row number four which tells us to
purl<00:01:18.409> back<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:19.159> purl<00:01:19.400> from<00:01:19.670> peg<00:01:19.880> 14<00:01:20.360> all<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
purl back to purl from peg 14 all the

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.310 
purl back to purl from peg 14 all the
way<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.409> peg<00:01:21.710> 1<00:01:22.150> so<00:01:23.150> your<00:01:23.390> working<00:01:23.659> yarn<00:01:24.020> is

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
way to peg 1 so your working yarn is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.060 
way to peg 1 so your working yarn is
wrapped<00:01:24.710> around<00:01:24.890> peg<00:01:25.490> 15<00:01:26.320> just<00:01:27.320> leave<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.830> the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
wrapped around peg 15 just leave it the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.300 
wrapped around peg 15 just leave it the
peg<00:01:28.310> 15<00:01:28.820> like<00:01:29.090> that<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.659> will<00:01:29.840> have<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.070> loop

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
peg 15 like that it will have the loop

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:42.270 
peg 15 like that it will have the loop
in<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.609> wrap<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:33.500> go<00:01:33.560> ahead<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.430> purl<00:01:35.119> peg<00:01:35.479> 14

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.429 

and<00:01:43.280> continue<00:01:43.880> purling<00:01:44.390> all<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.840> way<00:01:44.960> back<00:01:45.170> to

what you're doing you are knitting to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.770 
what you're doing you are knitting to
one<00:02:34.180> peg<00:02:34.860> before<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.280> wrap<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.390> you've<00:02:37.540> been

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
one peg before the wrap so you've been

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
are we have reached we have knitted two

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.680 
are we have reached we have knitted two
four<00:03:20.260> pegs<00:03:20.790> before<00:03:21.790> reaching<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.540> end

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
four pegs before reaching the end

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.550 
four pegs before reaching the end
there's<00:03:22.989> one<00:03:23.319> two<00:03:23.590> three<00:03:23.620> four<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.989> like<00:03:26.380> I

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.279 
we will need to this peg right here live
in<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.610> next<00:06:03.909> one<00:06:04.060> open<00:06:04.509> so<00:06:04.629> that<00:06:04.659> we<00:06:04.810> can<00:06:05.080> wrap

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
in the next one open so that we can wrap

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.180 
in the next one open so that we can wrap
it<00:06:05.530> once<00:06:06.190> we<00:06:06.400> wrap<00:06:06.610> it<00:06:06.960> we<00:06:07.960> turn<00:06:08.259> back<00:06:08.289> and<00:06:08.860> we

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
it once we wrap it we turn back and we
