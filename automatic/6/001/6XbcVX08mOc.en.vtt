00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.330
 Hi guys 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 now the mouth came to me and said 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.189
 So, Mom, what are you going to do today? 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.430
 I said I was going to make a risotto and she wanted 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:45.190
 Shoot this risotto which is very simple 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:46.719
 which is rain a little olive oil and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.770
 You can put butter on it. 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:55.690
 put the olive oil onion finely chopped 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.629
 put a little water 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.910
 if you do not want to put the side do not need 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.509
 after a few seconds that opposes the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:10.780
 onion I put the rice burst here is 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.420
 the same story of making white rice 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.310
 I do the same without the people they call 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.409
 toast the rice 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.630
 I'll leave a minute here one 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.790
 minute and a half in time to start 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.250
 loosen the pan 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.250
 I live with the White River. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.150
 because only here you think to do that 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.270
 You already have to put your broth to 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.360
 heating up now depends on the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.340
 that you will make 7 vegetables rise 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 be day with licenses by the site to 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.280
 download seafood 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.890
 I like to use a bass and it's a broth. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.760
 but here we are talking about 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.490
 fraud 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.180
 so is comfortable notes that involves 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.180
 to 77 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.420
 now I'll put my car 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.399
 slowly for you feeling for 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.770
 time you arrive at the end of the coach 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.440
 Montenegrin cause so dear to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.950
 and put what you want 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.790
 use here in my case will be the tomato 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.820
 dried arugula and buffalo mozzarella but 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.720
 this one more to the end and after that 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.930
 moment that I speak carlton duration for 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.100
 to be ready this episode is between 16 and 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.310
 18 minutes 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:49.970
 depends on how much you like it authenticated 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:52.280
 I will not add the dried tomatoes I 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.720
 playing always take but if you like 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.380
 You can put Italian tomatoes. 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.380
 the rocco 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.960
 I'm going to put a little salt on it. 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.250
 to be careful about salt because the 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.670
 risotto in the stock already saved in the cheese 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.970
 grated that goes at the end is in salt 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:33.260
 So it was a little bit just to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:37.300
 finish seasoning at the end and do not 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.300
 the one in your eyes 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:53.820
 for me it's great 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:57.140
 Let's fight, I'll put an improvement on one. 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.140
 little grated cheese 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.940
 NE metal 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:17.190
 today you see the sun is now the bodywork 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.209
 mouth there but in the end no 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.209
 respect a lot 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.260
 I think I had to kill 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.920
 find but I'm without 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.920
 around here
