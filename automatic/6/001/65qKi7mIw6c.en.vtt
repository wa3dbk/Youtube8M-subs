00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
so now when we open up awk so it should

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.830 
so now when we open up awk so it should
go<00:04:11.220> directly<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.910> media<00:04:12.299> controls<00:04:12.660> that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
you can see right there and then we also
