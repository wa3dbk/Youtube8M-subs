they're not taught their instinctual
okay<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.579> happened<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.000> we

interested<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:00.990> she<00:02:01.229> doesn't<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.740> she

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
interested of in she doesn't just she

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
interested of in she doesn't just she
goes<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.700> gets<00:02:02.850> her<00:02:02.939> brother<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.479> something

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
goes and gets her brother or something

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.359 
goes and gets her brother or something
and<00:02:03.960> since<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> brother<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.890> tell<00:02:05.130> him

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and since the brother to go tell him

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.240 
and since the brother to go tell him
that<00:02:05.579> he's<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:07.229> she's<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.829> she's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that he's that she's that she's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
that he's that she's that she's
interested<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.450> how<00:02:09.569> they<00:02:09.750> do

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
interested in and this is how they do

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.240 
interested in and this is how they do
this<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> thus<00:02:10.379> indirect<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this and thus indirect way it is a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
this and thus indirect way it is a
courting<00:02:11.700> ritual

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
courting ritual

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.900 
courting ritual
so<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.830> how<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.010> soldier<00:02:14.460> was<00:02:14.610> raised

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so this is how the soldier was raised

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.310 
so this is how the soldier was raised
and<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.480> reduced<00:02:15.780> Todd<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.200> always

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and this is reduced Todd I always

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.050 
and this is reduced Todd I always
thought<00:02:16.530> nothing<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.550> sort

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
thought nothing of the sort

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
thought nothing of the sort
but<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.480> win<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> method<00:02:19.200> soldier<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.920> know

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
but when I win a method soldier you know

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.360 
but when I win a method soldier you know
quite<00:02:20.400> oddly<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.750> met<00:02:22.230> him<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.830> I've<00:02:22.980> struck

what the strategy will show you is I'm
incredibly<00:03:57.329> loyal<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.650> how<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> would<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.640> be

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
incredibly loyal so how I would not be

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.280 
incredibly loyal so how I would not be
with<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> man<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.329> where<00:04:00.690> someone<00:04:00.959> else<00:04:01.170> is

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
this is what ology can do and can't do

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.989 
this is what ology can do and can't do
