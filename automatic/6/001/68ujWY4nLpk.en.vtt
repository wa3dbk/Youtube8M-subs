much because UAV jammer I mean it was

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.860 
much because UAV jammer I mean it was

UAV<00:03:49.170> jammer<00:03:49.470> has<00:03:49.590> evolved<00:03:50.280> into<00:03:50.430> something

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
UAV jammer has evolved into something

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.140 
UAV jammer has evolved into something
called<00:03:51.000> Ghost<00:03:51.360> Pro<00:03:51.810> nowadays<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.730> what<00:03:53.940> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
called Ghost Pro nowadays and what this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.390 
called Ghost Pro nowadays and what this
does<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.110> blocks<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.739> from<00:03:55.769> pretty<00:03:56.340> much

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
does is it blocks you from pretty much

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.330 
does is it blocks you from pretty much
