00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
significant changes to the hull design

it still has the the well rib side if
paddling<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:53.540> an<00:00:54.020> option<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.620> as<00:00:54.740> well<00:00:54.920> as

down around the Mirage Drive the only
really<00:01:02.540> significant<00:01:03.050> changes<00:01:03.080> is<00:01:03.650> that<00:01:04.309> you

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
really significant changes is that you

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.490 
really significant changes is that you
only<00:01:04.550> have<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:05.059> paddle<00:01:05.540> leash<00:01:05.690> on<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:06.110> side<00:01:06.380> of

purpose with the CT Vantage seat this is
where<00:01:25.790> there<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.750> some<00:01:27.080> modification<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.950> the

where there is some modification to the
hull<00:01:28.390> if<00:01:29.390> we<00:01:29.540> were<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.720> remove<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.229> seat<00:01:32.410> by

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
hull if we were to remove the seat by

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:43.679 
hull if we were to remove the seat by
unclipping<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.550> from<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.880> hull

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.120 

it<00:01:44.689> has<00:01:44.840> an<00:01:44.990> internal<00:01:45.350> drainage<00:01:45.680> bug

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
it has an internal drainage bug

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.109 
it has an internal drainage bug
underneath<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.180> seat<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.830> with<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.700> deeper

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
underneath the seat so with the deeper

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.320 
underneath the seat so with the deeper
recessed<00:01:50.570> hull<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.650> allow<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.970> CTC<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.150> fit

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
recessed hull to allow the CTC to fit

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.780 
recessed hull to allow the CTC to fit
into<00:01:53.619> if<00:01:54.619> you're<00:01:54.860> holding<00:01:55.220> any<00:01:55.340> water<00:01:55.640> in

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
into if you're holding any water in

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.590 
into if you're holding any water in
there<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.110> pull<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.149> drain<00:01:59.390> plug

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
there you just pull on the drain plug

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.899 
there you just pull on the drain plug
and<00:02:00.190> it<00:02:01.190> releases<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.700> water

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
and it releases the water

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.719 
and it releases the water
now<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.090> we've<00:02:05.600> discussed<00:02:05.990> them<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.320> land

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
now that we've discussed them on land

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.160 
now that we've discussed them on land
it's<00:02:07.729> time<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.119> put<00:02:08.300> them<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.660> water

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
it's time to put them on the water

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.650 
it's time to put them on the water
let's<00:02:09.709> test<00:02:09.979> put<00:02:10.190> them<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.550> test<00:02:11.060> envelope

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
let's test put them to the test envelope

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.870 
let's test put them to the test envelope
style<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:14.440> mean<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.680> Revo<00:02:16.010> now<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.489> seat

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
style I mean the Revo now with the seat

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.850 
style I mean the Revo now with the seat
in<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.150> highest<00:02:17.450> position<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:20.560> having<00:02:21.560> used

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
in the highest position and having used

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.160 
in the highest position and having used
a<00:02:22.010> Revo<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.910> last<00:02:23.120> seven<00:02:23.989> or<00:02:24.050> eight

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
a Revo for it the last seven or eight

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.740 
a Revo for it the last seven or eight
years<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:27.760> don't<00:02:28.760> believe<00:02:29.450> we've<00:02:29.720> lost

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
years it's I don't believe we've lost

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.430 
years it's I don't believe we've lost
any<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.709> stability<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.870> have<00:02:33.049> had<00:02:33.230> by

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
any of the stability that have had by

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.610 
any of the stability that have had by
being<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.040> higher<00:02:34.280> position<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.590> just

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
being in this higher position and I just

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.960 
being in this higher position and I just
worked<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.220> why<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:38.450> paddle<00:02:39.580> leashes<00:02:40.580> on<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
worked out why the paddle leashes on the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.660 
worked out why the paddle leashes on the
right<00:02:41.840> hand<00:02:42.080> side<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.769> not<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.069> left<00:02:43.250> because

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
right hand side and not the left because

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.030 
right hand side and not the left because
when<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.690> now<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.170> your<00:02:45.320> rudder<00:02:45.530> turning

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
when you now have your rudder turning

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.069 
when you now have your rudder turning
outside<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.700> boat<00:02:46.880> which<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.840> big

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
outside the boat which is a big

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.110 
outside the boat which is a big
improvement<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.880> could<00:02:50.120> be<00:02:50.329> in<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
improvement because you could be in the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.810 
improvement because you could be in the
in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.470> 2014<00:02:54.470> model<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.400> would<00:02:55.549> rub

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
in the 2014 model and it would rub

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.520 
in the 2014 model and it would rub
against<00:02:56.150> your<00:02:56.239> leg<00:02:56.510> trying<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> turn<00:02:57.109> it<00:02:57.140> so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
against your leg trying to turn it so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.940 
against your leg trying to turn it so
that's<00:02:57.829> awesome<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.000> now<00:02:59.209> done

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that's awesome that it's now done

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.900 
that's awesome that it's now done
outside<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.010> hull

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
just test able to get into the front
