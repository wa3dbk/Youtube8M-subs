looks<00:00:32.129> like<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.399> person<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.989> pretty

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
looks like in person so this is pretty

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100 
looks like in person so this is pretty
close<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> looks<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:36.510> person

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
