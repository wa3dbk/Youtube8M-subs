00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello today we're going to make a pie 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 cockles with corn flour and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.129
 we started by putting the cockles in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.790
 abundant water with salt to release 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.070
 all the sand 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.000
 while we are going to make the mass of the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.630
 pie with kilo of corn flour 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 yellow 100 grams of wheat flour 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 we mix well the two flours 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.519
 we make a hole in the center and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.829
 we begin to add water the water the 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.350
 let's add little by little and it has always 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.809
 to be hot we also put 50 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.000
 grams of baker's yeast 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.600
 we dissolve well in the water and we begin 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.600
 to mix 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.690
 little by little we are adding water 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.540
 and also a well of olive oil 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.460
 to 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.550
 as the dough goes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.840
 asking we are adding water and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.840
 remember to put salt 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.340
 we knead everything well for a long time 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.260
 and when we have a consistent dough 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.530
 although it is soft we group all 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.230
 we put a cloth over it and we're going 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.020
 to let light give in a place without 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.300
 currents and warm for one hour 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.120
 approximately 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.120
 while we took the opportunity to chop a couple 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.720
 of garlic cloves 600 grams of onion 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.140
 that it should not be chopped very small and 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.740
 a pair of peppers one red and another 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.659
 green in a large pan with plenty 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 olive oil we put the chopped garlic 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.740
 the chopped onion 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.380
 Y 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.829
 we add salt and we'll let it go 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.829
 making over low heat 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.819
 we take advantage to wash the cockles 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.310
 and steam them 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.160
 when the onion starts to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.160
 transparent we add the peppers 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.200
 and we will leave them over a low heat for a 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.200
 good time 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.069
 the cockles are already open what 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.319
 we remove the shells and we reserve it 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.519
 when we have almost the entire face 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.139
 done we add saffron and a couple of 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.139
 teaspoons sweet paprika 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.490
 we remove everything well and leave it at 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.070
 fire between 34 minutes more 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.830
 when it is ready we remove it and when 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.010
 wait for you with that same oil, let's go 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.590
 grease the oven 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.019
 we already have the ready mass this is not a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.710
 mass that can be stretched therefore 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.650
 moisten slightly moss hands 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.040
 and we are taking lots of dough 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.840
 that we will crush between our palms and 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.530
 we will put these remnants on the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.530
 baking dish 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.280
 i 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.280
 ah 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.410
 let's unite some patches with others 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.090
 accommodating the dough and giving it a slight 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.090
 height above the walls of the fountain 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.260
 maybe this is the most cumbersome of all 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.260
 the recipe 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.750
 and little by little we cover the entire source 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.020
 now on the mass we put all the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.020
 face 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.530
 we extend it well 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.770
 and then we add the others 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.770
 rights 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.710
 ah 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.560
 we deal well over all the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.389
 Patty 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.380
 in the same way we made the base let's 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.380
 covering the pie 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.270
 do not mind that the oil overflows 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.280
 with the help of a fork 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.280
 we seal the edges of the empanada 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.529
 and with the non-cutting part of the edge of the 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.049
 knife 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.479
 we mark the empanada so that after 

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:14.839
 when it's done, it's much easier 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.839
 cut 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.060
 we put it in the oven about 40 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.430
 180 degrees 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.060
 and after this time this is what 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.560
 we take out 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.560
 come I hope you like it
