form six divider stages and they divide

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.819 
form six divider stages and they divide
the<00:00:57.480> frequency<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.050> half<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.680> it's

the frequency in half and it's
stabilized<00:00:59.430> by<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.940> pot<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
stabilized by this pot here you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.889 
stabilized by this pot here you can
adjust<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.520> them<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.789> missing<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
adjust that if one of them is missing it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.630 
adjust that if one of them is missing it
might<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.860> fallen<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.549> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
might be that that is fallen out of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
might be that that is fallen out of
adjustment<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:07.670> anyway<00:01:08.670> those<00:01:09.540> frequencies

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
adjustment and anyway those frequencies

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
adjustment and anyway those frequencies
go<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.920> distribution<00:01:11.820> network<00:01:12.180> down

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
go to this distribution network down

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
go to this distribution network down
here<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.350> resistor<00:01:13.890> network

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
here which is just a resistor network

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.719 
here which is just a resistor network
that<00:01:14.729> taps<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:16.250> combinations<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that taps the right combinations to the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.300 
that taps the right combinations to the
right<00:01:17.909> wires<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.840> run<00:01:18.869> underneath<00:01:19.799> the

keyboard II to these switch contacts you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.960 
keyboard II to these switch contacts you
can<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> prep<00:01:26.270> we<00:01:27.270> press<00:01:27.630> which<00:01:28.970> contacts

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
can see a prep we press which contacts

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
can see a prep we press which contacts
moving<00:01:30.420> over<00:01:30.600> there<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:30.930> move<00:01:31.140> those

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
moving over there and you can move those

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.560 
moving over there and you can move those
individually<00:01:32.189> by<00:01:32.400> hand<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.270> they're

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
individually by hand to see if they're

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.569 
individually by hand to see if they're
all<00:01:34.460> doing<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.930> appropriate<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.579> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
all doing the appropriate thing and so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
all doing the appropriate thing and so
we've<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> footage<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.200> mixed<00:01:40.619> right

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
we've got all the footage is mixed right

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.749 
we've got all the footage is mixed right
now<00:01:41.420> over<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> draw<00:01:43.140> bars<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
now over here on the draw bars so that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.340 
now over here on the draw bars so that
you<00:01:44.850> hear<00:01:45.180> something<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> those<00:01:46.110> if

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you hear something on all of those if

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
you hear something on all of those if
any<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> these<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:47.009> pushed<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
any of these are pushed in then you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.859 
any of these are pushed in then you
wouldn't<00:01:48.000> hear<00:01:48.240> anything<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.720> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
wouldn't hear anything on that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.109 
wouldn't hear anything on that
particular<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.549> since<00:01:50.820> they're<00:01:51.000> all

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
particular one but since they're all

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.569 
particular one but since they're all
pulled<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.689> hear<00:01:51.869> something<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
pulled out we hear something and so

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
pulled out we hear something and so
anyway<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.200> machine

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
anyway that's kind of how this machine

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.639 
anyway that's kind of how this machine
works<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> got<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:56.579> vibrato<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.649> power

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
works you got your vibrato and and power

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
works you got your vibrato and and power
supply<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.430> stuff<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
supply and all this stuff back there and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.609 
supply and all this stuff back there and
your<00:02:00.990> output<00:02:02.000> amplifier<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> anyway<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.439> got

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
your output amplifier and anyway we got

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
your output amplifier and anyway we got
Paul<00:02:04.920> Hagen<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.610> today<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.060> he's<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.360> to
