already<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.900> drift<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> slow<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
already you can drift a lot to slow you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770 
already you can drift a lot to slow you
down<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> don't

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
down because if you don't if you don't

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.030 
down because if you don't if you don't
drip<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.799> cars<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.909> fast

like<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.820> harder<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like that and it's harder for you to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.679 
like that and it's harder for you to
control<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.540> let's<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:21.900> well<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
control so let's see how well I do here

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.820 
control so let's see how well I do here
again<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> said<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> my

easily addicted to it oh it's pretty
hard<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> explain<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> game<00:01:33.090> while<00:01:33.240> doing

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hard to explain the game while doing

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
hard to explain the game while doing
this<00:01:34.170> video<00:01:34.369> okay<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.090> point<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> game

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this video okay so the point of the game

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.249 
this video okay so the point of the game
is<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.380> crash<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.450> not<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.720> caught<00:01:39.960> by

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
is not to crash and not to get caught by

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
is not to crash and not to get caught by
those<00:01:40.530> cops

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.840 

so<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.570> car<00:01:46.870> can<00:01:47.080> drift<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.560> lot<00:01:47.830> however<00:01:48.640> if

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
so this car can drift a lot however if

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.820 
so this car can drift a lot however if
you<00:01:48.940> don't<00:01:49.150> drip<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.930> are<00:01:50.080> gonna<00:01:50.230> go<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:50.620> fast

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
you don't drip you are gonna go so fast

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.610 
you don't drip you are gonna go so fast
and<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.310> crash<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.270> 18<00:01:52.840> seconds<00:01:53.260> I<00:01:53.350> think<00:01:53.500> my

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
and you crash so 18 seconds I think my

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.540 
and you crash so 18 seconds I think my
best<00:01:53.920> one<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:54.190> far<00:01:54.370> is<00:01:55.000> 30<00:01:55.330> seconds<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.340> look

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
best one so far is 30 seconds if I look

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.790 
best one so far is 30 seconds if I look
at<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.970> high<00:01:58.150> scores<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:58.690> think<00:01:58.900> right<00:01:59.560> now

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
at the high scores I think right now

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.700 
at the high scores I think right now
someone<00:02:00.310> has<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:01.750> four<00:02:02.050> minutes<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710

bit crazy because I'm having a hard time

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.710 
bit crazy because I'm having a hard time
here<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:06.310> car<00:02:06.580> goes<00:02:06.790> really<00:02:07.030> fast<00:02:07.330> if<00:02:07.630> you
