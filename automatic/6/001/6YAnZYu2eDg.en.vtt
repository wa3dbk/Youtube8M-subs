00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
so dolly asked the piece of hangs by and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.080 
so dolly asked the piece of hangs by and
it<00:02:57.019> would<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.470> been<00:02:57.560> easier<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:01.820> do<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.030> like

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
it would have been easier you do it like

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.610 
it would have been easier you do it like
this<00:03:02.920> then<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.220> goes<00:03:04.489> on<00:03:04.700> top<00:03:05.320> back<00:03:06.320> then

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
this then it goes on top back then

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.759 
this then it goes on top back then
reattach<00:03:08.170> there<00:03:09.170> see<00:03:10.390> now<00:03:11.390> cuz<00:03:11.810> watch<00:03:12.019> if<00:03:12.470> we
