00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Do you know why because carnival 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.720
 carnival mania without forgetting natasha bobbin 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 our colleague comes to us every morning 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
 talks about what day it is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.599
 what to do what traditions have come down to ours 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 what days were 100 years ago 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.880
 but as for pancakes, not only 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.460
 pancakes you can enjoy yourself at Shrovetide 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.619
 for example, you can and high molecular 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 the kitchen is quite right prestigious 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 food contest golden bokuz 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 Russian cooks went to France 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 sorry this time in not ended up 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.989
 pedestal but this is a culinary forum 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.300
 again confirmed the fashion for molecular 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 the kitchen like you in general said now 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 instead of traditional dishes in restaurants 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 increasingly fall scrambled eggs oh even 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.140
 give is worth hard mango spaghetti 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 from strawberry chicken ice cream is higher 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 higher just every journey I dream 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.210
 to try 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 it seems to me who thought it up to give 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 some awards, too, how to come up 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.350
 combine completely incompatible 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 seemingly products our reporter 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.980
 with restaurateur anatoly lump 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.229
 understands the intricacies of modern 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 cooking 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.080
 we first scored sauce into the siphon and now 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.659
 from siphon 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 We lay it in its liquid nitrogen 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.979
 temperature is about minus 200 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.950
 degrees C using nitrogen 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 beetroot sauce is instantly frozen 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.000
 now it looks more like meringues 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.220
 restaurateur Anatoly Kom assures products 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 processed with this substance can be 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.509
 threats to health they do not represent 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 because liquid nitrogen is instant 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.930
 evaporates and yet the dish is not for 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.210
 faint of heart trying scary smokes 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.220
 take a water ticket 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.040
 beets turned out to be tastier than usual 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.260
 ice cream so I was afraid in vain people 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.080

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.300
 nicknamed molecular cuisine she's thin 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.430
 hearing such a phrase frowns 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.070
 says the term cause him 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 easy heartburn and because any kitchen 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.770

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 make yourself a molecular sugar kitchen 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.149
 Molecular cuisine you put tea 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.149
 changed structures from tea became sweet 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.060
 took the egg liquid thrown cooking 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.959

 Eggplant Tomatoes Peppers Champignons 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.570
 no chemistry and gamma secret here is not 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.610

 this fit under the press under strong 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.920
 compression 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.849
 those cells that are filled with excess 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.489
 water they burst it water goes away because 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.550
 this you increase the taste you understand what 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.620
 more water the more taste is blurred than 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.750
 less water in the product tastes more 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.670

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.440
 cook and home true for this 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.989

 because pressed vegetables for 12 hours 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.370
