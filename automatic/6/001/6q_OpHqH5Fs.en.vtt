the new iPad so we have an ice chest
here<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:48.559> we<00:00:49.559> used<00:00:49.770> our<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.219> infrared

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
here and we used our little infrared

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
here and we used our little infrared
thermometer<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.600> determine<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.620> 31

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.470 
degrees now the iPad stated temperature
range<00:00:56.100> says<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> safely<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.180> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
happens if we push it just a little

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.009 
happens if we push it just a little

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
but it seems like the biggest problem we

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.820 
but it seems like the biggest problem we
have<00:01:56.550> here<00:01:56.580> if<00:01:57.180> anything<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.900> just<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.680> the

a<00:02:43.410> small<00:02:43.830> formation<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.610> condensation<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:46.170> let

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
a small formation of condensation we let

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.170 
a small formation of condensation we let
it<00:02:46.440> rest<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.920> cool<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.160> another<00:02:47.700> 30<00:02:48.090> minutes

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it rest and cool for another 30 minutes

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.910 
it rest and cool for another 30 minutes
and<00:02:48.750> bit<00:02:49.020> survived<00:02:54.290> all<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.500> our<00:02:55.650> third

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and bit survived all right our third

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.710 
and bit survived all right our third
generation<00:02:56.100> iPad<00:02:56.790> has<00:02:57.000> survived<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.510> cold

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
generation iPad has survived the cold

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.170 
generation iPad has survived the cold
test<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.739> heat<00:02:58.920> test<00:02:59.190> which<00:02:59.820> is<00:02:59.970> pretty

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
test and the heat test which is pretty

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.880 
test and the heat test which is pretty
impressive<00:03:00.450> we're<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.050> continue<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
impressive we're going to continue the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.160 
impressive we're going to continue the
torture<00:03:02.250> test<00:03:02.489> gauntlet<00:03:03.030> today<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.810> find<00:03:04.019> out

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
torture test gauntlet today we find out

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.650 
torture test gauntlet today we find out
if<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.530> take<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.769> drop<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.519> our<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.269> see

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
if it can take a drop on our way to see

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.300 
if it can take a drop on our way to see
if<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.840> makes<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.140> all<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.290> way<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> water

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.340 

alright<00:03:11.310> we've<00:03:11.459> devised<00:03:11.820> three<00:03:12.390> drop<00:03:13.019> zones

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
alright we've devised three drop zones

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.370 
alright we've devised three drop zones
for<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.860> new<00:03:14.100> iPad<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.850> first<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.480> about<00:03:15.900> 18

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
for the new iPad the first is about 18

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.380 
for the new iPad the first is about 18
inches<00:03:16.410> which<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.130> estimating<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.060> about<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
inches which I'm estimating is about the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.140 
inches which I'm estimating is about the
height<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.840> bedside<00:03:19.320> table<00:03:19.590> then<00:03:20.310> assuming

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
height of a bedside table then assuming

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.509 
height of a bedside table then assuming
it<00:03:21.269> survives<00:03:21.799> we're<00:03:22.799> going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.010> knock<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.220> off

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
it survives we're going to knock it off

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.580 
it survives we're going to knock it off
this<00:03:23.730> countertop<00:03:24.330> here<00:03:24.600> which<00:03:24.810> seems<00:03:25.170> likely

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
this countertop here which seems likely

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.770 
this countertop here which seems likely
if<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.280> left<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> table<00:03:27.299> or<00:03:27.510> if<00:03:27.660> you're

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
if it's left on a table or if you're

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.320 
if it's left on a table or if you're
cooking<00:03:27.959> with<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.769> kitchen

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
cooking with it in the kitchen

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.690 
cooking with it in the kitchen
finally<00:03:30.330> assuming<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.019> survives<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.860> will

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
finally assuming it survives that will

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.330 
finally assuming it survives that will
drop<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.090> from<00:03:33.590> standing<00:03:34.590> height<00:03:34.799> which<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.160> me

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
drop it from standing height which on me

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.729 
drop it from standing height which on me
is<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.549> little<00:03:35.910> unfair<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.420> know<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.709> I

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
is a little unfair I know but you know I

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.990 
is a little unfair I know but you know I
don't<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.100> guy<00:03:38.340> could<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.610> holding<00:03:38.850> it

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
don't know a guy could be holding it

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.110 
don't know a guy could be holding it

now<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:20.100> almost<00:04:21.100> did<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.400> too<00:04:21.640> soon

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
now I almost did it too soon

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.850

moment look at that iPad officially
survives<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.530> drop<00:04:38.770> test<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:40.300> fact<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.720> think

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
survives the drop test in fact I think

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.159 
survives the drop test in fact I think
I'm<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.410> worse<00:04:41.590> shape<00:04:41.680> than<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.190> iPad<00:04:42.490> is

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
I'm in worse shape than the iPad is

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.290 
I'm in worse shape than the iPad is
you

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.110 

now<00:04:50.110> incredibly<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.950> new<00:04:51.100> iPad<00:04:51.460> has<00:04:51.700> survived

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
now incredibly the new iPad has survived

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.630 
now incredibly the new iPad has survived
all<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.720> our<00:04:52.870> drop<00:04:53.170> tests<00:04:53.710> which<00:04:53.860> frankly<00:04:54.370> I

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
all of our drop tests which frankly I

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.840 
all of our drop tests which frankly I
was<00:04:55.510> not<00:04:55.780> expecting<00:04:56.050> but<00:04:56.800> now<00:04:57.160> we've<00:04:57.490> devised

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
was not expecting but now we've devised

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.420 
was not expecting but now we've devised
a<00:04:58.150> wildcard<00:04:58.870> test<00:04:59.230> so<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.500> was<00:04:59.740> thinking<00:05:00.250> a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
a wildcard test so I was thinking a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.640 
a wildcard test so I was thinking a
thing<00:05:00.970> that<00:05:01.120> happens<00:05:01.450> to<00:05:01.540> my<00:05:01.810> iPad<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.260> lot<00:05:02.500> is

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
thing that happens to my iPad a lot is

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.890 
thing that happens to my iPad a lot is
that<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:02.890> drop<00:05:03.220> other<00:05:03.430> things<00:05:04.030> on<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.420> so<00:05:04.630> we

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
that I drop other things on it so we

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.470 
that I drop other things on it so we
have<00:05:05.050> three<00:05:05.380> items<00:05:05.590> here<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:07.060> start<00:05:07.300> with<00:05:07.390> the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
have three items here to start with the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.490
