00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 self 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.650
 we are here in front of the toshiba stand 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.509
 toshiba this year at the stand has staked everything on his hear then to say the 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.010
 television with the eternal processor used in the ps3 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.920
 al we see for a moment how new TV cost that we remember to be behaves 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.819
 accommodating capable of 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.669
 reproduce 3D images and transform the 2d into 3D in real time 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.050
 sexy 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.940
 here we see the feeling that now it is reproducing a relative matter in 3d 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 is a sort of varedo auto route between toshiba 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.780
 jovantti 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.610
 let's see a location instead the conversion is done in real time from 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 2d a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 3d directly from the processor s here we are 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.730
 they are turning off as the processor using the tred hector technology 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.750
 toshiba owners can transform any image then 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 the news is very much a non-native 3D movie 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.350
 inna content instead three-dimensional stereoscopic 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.810
 i hope for glasses business 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.600
 another feature of the saddle processor which is the possibility of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.780
 to interpret 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.670
 le gestor that is 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.130
 hand movements here we see that is for nothing 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.820
 moving 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.440
 motion pictures - move everything simply using the hand mail 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.000
 in front of the monitor 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.410
 a kind of project natal 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.750
 trying as a microsoft project for next year 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 applied however to televisions 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.990
 toshiba remember that since this year the range of blue has been removed 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.750
 ray 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.700
 format for the new that always under motorola credible testo eli bvx 3 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.520
 milano queen elmore already compatible with slabs of and also uefa and certified 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.030
 this is instead a lower model 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.470
 keeper also integrates the wi-fi connection 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.160
 the pd x 2005 also connects the internet then accesses are free seo vutu pandora 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.850
 obviously not the pearl 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.859
 Italy at the exit logic with all the queues reintegrated 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.099
 alcohol and thrush sd card slot 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.089
 what I have quartet the box that contains the sl processor 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.419
 the unverified mind the most integrated in an external box 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.439
 currently reused connected this tv4 4k resolution tape for 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.230
 le k then super resolution 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.940
 and the same saddle processor that does the laps keyline conversion 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.039
 from my the 3000 lots of native full hd 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.099
 to 3340 for 2160 of 4k for a2k 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.259
 among the algorithms present 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.349
 on the processor if there is still particular for a tonight resoluciÃ³n 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.009
 Plassa 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.089
 toshiba 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.360
 by now, and what the majority of movies expect 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.780
 are downloaded from the internet and therefore introduced an algorithm that succeeds in 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.129
 reduce block artifacts in the 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.699
 from the video cribs present on youtube here we see on the right unoprost though if 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.780
 you are my left instead one without next 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.569
 that much this treatise this is made instead very very piriform 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.849
 artifacts are seen -
