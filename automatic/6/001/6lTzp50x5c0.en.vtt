00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
really able to get that one side open

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.130 
really able to get that one side open
and<00:00:20.550> after<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.210> Steen<00:00:21.539> also<00:00:21.930> came

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and after that you know Steen also came

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620 
and after that you know Steen also came
in<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:23.189> know<00:00:23.310> he<00:00:23.460> also<00:00:23.609> scored<00:00:24.000> runs<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
in and you know he also scored runs and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660 
in and you know he also scored runs and
they<00:00:24.810> had<00:00:24.930> more<00:00:25.529> than<00:00:25.650> 50<00:00:25.920> runs<00:00:26.039> partnership

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
they had more than 50 runs partnership

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
they had more than 50 runs partnership
which<00:00:26.789> meant<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:28.140> were<00:00:28.199> supposed<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> chase

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
which meant we were supposed to chase

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.279 
which meant we were supposed to chase
something<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.550> excess<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.029> 300<00:00:30.300> which<00:00:31.109> i<00:00:31.230> think

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
something in excess of 300 which i think

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.220 
something in excess of 300 which i think
is<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.590> difficult<00:00:32.030> so<00:00:33.030> yeah<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> should<00:00:34.110> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
is very difficult so yeah I should have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
is very difficult so yeah I should have
got<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.559> wicked<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.940> could<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.180> done

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
got that wicked we could have done

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
got that wicked we could have done
something<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.719> special<00:00:37.430> but<00:00:38.430> still<00:00:38.670> you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
something very special but still you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.450 
something very special but still you
know<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.059> tried<00:00:39.270> our<00:00:39.450> best<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.170> couldn't

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
know we tried our best but we couldn't

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.940 
know we tried our best but we couldn't
well<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:42.079> if<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.500> would<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.680> won<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
well you know if we would have won the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.670 
well you know if we would have won the
first<00:00:44.250> toss<00:00:44.690> no<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> series<00:00:46.530> would

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
first toss no I think the series would

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.340 
first toss no I think the series would
have<00:00:46.739> looked<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.489> different<00:00:47.700> because

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
have looked very different because

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.450 
have looked very different because
century<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> believe<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.160> apart

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
century and I believe you know apart

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
century and I believe you know apart
from<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.789> first<00:00:51.149> day<00:00:51.390> wicked<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.440> was

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
from the first day wicked I think it was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.920 
from the first day wicked I think it was
the<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> flattest<00:00:54.480> wicked<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the one of the flattest wicked that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
the one of the flattest wicked that
you'll<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.320> South<00:00:55.620> Africa<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.820> think

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
you'll see in South Africa so I think

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.020 
you'll see in South Africa so I think
that<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.719> crucial<00:00:58.309> toss<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.520> lose<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that was a very crucial toss to lose and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.439 
that was a very crucial toss to lose and
I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.530> am<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.789> think

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I think in this am also you know I think

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.270 
I think in this am also you know I think
the<00:01:03.539> toss<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.930> were<00:01:04.260> able<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> win<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.949> toss

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the toss we were able to win the toss

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600 
the toss we were able to win the toss
and<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> South<00:01:06.000> African<00:01:06.450> team<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
and put the South African team into that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.250 
and put the South African team into that
so<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.790> had<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.150> advantage<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> was

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so we had that advantage because it was

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.560 
so we had that advantage because it was
a<00:01:10.290> condition<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.820> overcast<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a condition you know it was overcast and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.289 
a condition you know it was overcast and
was<00:01:12.930> helping<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> fast<00:01:13.590> bowlers<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> once

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
was helping the fast bowlers but once

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.969 
was helping the fast bowlers but once
the<00:01:15.840> rain<00:01:15.990> happened<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.619> after<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the rain happened you know after that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.940 
the rain happened you know after that
result<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:18.390> were<00:01:18.540> asked<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> play<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.799> an

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
result when we were asked to play on an

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
result when we were asked to play on an
outfield<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.700> quite<00:01:20.909> well<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
outfield that was quite well you know I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.620 
outfield that was quite well you know I
think<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:23.700> vantage<00:01:24.090> was<00:01:24.180> taken<00:01:24.509> away

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
think we that vantage was taken away

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.620 
think we that vantage was taken away
from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> fast<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.619> us<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.400> ball

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
from the fast for us because the ball

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.270 
from the fast for us because the ball
the<00:01:27.630> seam<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> ball<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.650> became<00:01:29.040> wet

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the seam of the ball you know became wet

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.440 
the seam of the ball you know became wet
and<00:01:29.460> after<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.119> no<00:01:30.210> lateral

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and after that there was no lateral

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.780 
and after that there was no lateral
movement<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> believe<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> became

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
movement for them so I believe it became

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
movement for them so I believe it became
a<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.360> easy<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.009> tough

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
a bit easy but still it was tough

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
a bit easy but still it was tough
because<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.670> personally<00:01:36.479> felt<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.900> know<00:01:37.049> we

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
because I personally felt you know we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.999 
because I personally felt you know we
played<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.159> day<00:01:38.490> night<00:01:38.700> test<00:01:39.000> because

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
played the first day night test because

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
played the first day night test because
that<00:01:41.009> date<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.579> dark<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.000> were<00:01:42.060> playing

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that date was very dark we were playing

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210 
that date was very dark we were playing
under<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.540> light<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.619> must<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.100> been

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
under the light so it must have been

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
under the light so it must have been
tough<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.540> Callie's<00:01:45.540> along<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.899> other

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
tough for Callie's along with other

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
out in the series that's one thing and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
out in the series that's one thing and
what<00:01:59.130> else<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.969> catching<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.420> brilliant

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
what else the the catching was brilliant

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.060 
what else the the catching was brilliant
throughout<00:02:00.990> because<00:02:01.409> nothing<00:02:01.710> came<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
throughout because nothing came to the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.039 
throughout because nothing came to the
slip<00:02:02.310> cordon<00:02:02.670> everything<00:02:03.630> came<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
slip cordon everything came to the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.720 
slip cordon everything came to the
keeper

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.150 

so<00:02:07.730> no<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> think<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.470> feeling<00:02:09.680> standard

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
so no I think the the feeling standard

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.130 
so no I think the the feeling standard
was<00:02:10.310> quite<00:02:10.520> good<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:11.390> still<00:02:11.630> on<00:02:11.840> there<00:02:11.960> plenty

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
was quite good but still on there plenty

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.760 
was quite good but still on there plenty
of<00:02:12.470> things<00:02:13.250> where<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.700> need<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.090> improve<00:02:14.120> and
