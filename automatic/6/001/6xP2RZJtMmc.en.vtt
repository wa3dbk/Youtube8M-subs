00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.300

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.340

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.750
 I would have uploaded good video we are here 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.039
 in a game of paintball that I 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.619
 loved it quite the last time he had 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.110
 when here and the truth that I liked 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.269
 very much and this game is good is 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.910
 super pretty I do not know where I 'm from 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.949
 the blue ones I think and you have to kill the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.679
 reds let's see how it has been covered 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.470
 here are a few of me has been 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:38.020
 charged one of mine when they do not 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.580
 There's a guy here 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.140
 look at her look at her look at her look at her 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.850
 watch her look at him but take 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 take 2 - 2 - 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 charged me lad 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.409
 there are three left three remain three 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.730
 where are they where they are 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.620
 there are two 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.020
 and they are 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 hard mother of mine is to find out where 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.590
 they are where they have gotten from 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.080
 height are nothing or I think it is 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.080
 better to climb in a part of above 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.050
 why over here 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.050
 one of the reds may be 2 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.820
 121 of the reds here 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.900
 Take it now that there are 4 I realize now 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:33.610
 four because uncle and they have killed me and that 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.720
 recording if you do not die then return to 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.720
 reappear maybe not 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.159
 it may seem good there are two of the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.159
 red 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.909
 I guess they saved me can save me 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.259
 and everyone can save me, I'm the one 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.090
 player with the most points at the moment 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.760
 they are shooting I think I do not know where 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.260
 I think there's red here 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.080
 red but there are none 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.790
 and I'm getting nervous because I do not 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.470
 I know there is a stadium location 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.060
 We are the whole team again 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.300
 once again 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.050
 that is what motivated me that when shooting 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.760
 the sky is all stained and I think it's going to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.390
 finish the game I do not know where it is 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.250
 God 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.410
 and these stay here travelers are 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.990
 can move how I love this and 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.010
 let's see a stay is not sure 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.950
 that is super hidden 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.910
 super mega the ultra hidden and it does not 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 move around the map 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.880
 prompting you to look for it because you see the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.580
 name like that but did not know that being there 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.220
 hidden or something 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.220
 it's a stadium that has not gotten 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.690
 fight 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.000
 in search of the lost man 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.400
 mother I was sure that she has eyes 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.460
 blind of those guys and we did not find it 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.620
 that's why we can play another thing 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.330
 Massa say what is parkour 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.460
 It's pretty bad for me as you just saw 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.290
 if you like to leave me with comments 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.190
 and may also do a series if you 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.890
 like this one remains one is one remains 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.480
 one and where this can be a series 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.950
 of good I say it here while 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.070
 we are looking for the last one that we need 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.990
 because my mother here we voted and I am 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.720
 the player with the best with the most rank 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.720

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.100
 plan as I am one-armed and maybe there 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.810
 a series let's say learning to play 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.460
 helping you for the comments 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.800
 so you can interact with all 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.150
