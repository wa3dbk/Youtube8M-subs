 have human coletti and put that as 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.880
 when you're at sea then I'm trying to 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.320
 do it again like me 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 even I think very loud saïd ali 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.230
 good after me once I once 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.570
 I was him or that tree 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.540
 you see this drug until the end of 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.250
 path 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.540
 yeah happy and it's like dogs 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.950
 they scared me there is there 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.530
 had big bad guys ching me 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.000
 afraid that after power is also a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 small precision but it did not framed 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.630
 enough you see well here is too framed 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.489
 so also to fit well 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.220
 you have to put the opinion 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.750
 the first plateau from below the most yes 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.390
 to life to be there but the little yes 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.980
 here and you see you lie there he 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.920
 you put the biggest chain that's 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.570
 to say on those speeds there a movie was 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.670
 the first and let's go there it's sincere 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.860
 but you put the first tray of a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.260
 down for this last time that 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.110
 you connect rolls to see where the need is 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 that I roll you like that fast and 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.290
 like that seems much more 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.959
 easily because if you put a 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:56.110
 plateau too high and try with a 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:59.490
 plateau too much to late I arrive 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:08.450
 trying with a tray too 8 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:12.450
 this is the one here it is impossible 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.400
 see it's impossible impossible even 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.739
 if you have a nice bike make shots 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.820
 stuffed blow is super strong to be 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.820
 musclor for that 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:27.660
 here is the roofs of cities 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.910
 where I was told how fabrice you 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.430
 put then I recap it needs it 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.280
 explain it m yes morning I read no 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.940
 pity you must not get too upset you do not have to 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.900
 no more past must put a small 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.430
 speed to cover the easiest one 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.970
 is never the green case as a step 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.410
 downhill 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:59.210
 we can try it's not tip top 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:02.010
 they dropped me and never 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:07.380
 you fit you have to be at the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:09.210
 rivard street and once a lot roll 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.170
 quickly do not pool your speed on 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.170
 internet 1 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.460
 so I drive fast, it does not want 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:38.170
 go up but now it's not rocket science that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:40.530
 that but not quite because I 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.290
 let's let the hands make a 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:56.160
 looping exactly I did not understand anything 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:56.160
 but yeah yeah her sexy nice ass 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:12.420
 1 how are you doing well I start 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:12.420
 a little further down here is an acceleration 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:24.070
 that we are worthless a little said a 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:25.540
 little last at the base '' last before 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.480
 to do good shooting habits 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.480
 is well hidden a camera 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.070
 see the law he did he made his 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.140
 commit so what your approach to 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:44.409
 go downhill it's more I 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:46.360
 look yes here it is 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.939

 to have fun so one last 

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.610
