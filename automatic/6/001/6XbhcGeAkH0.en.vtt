00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.440
 It is a picture of Rakuraya 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:11.350
 Weakened body revives today 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.350
 In reference to the book called human mechanics 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:22.530
 Effective against stiff shoulders coming from tired tired arm 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:28.100
 When we introduce vertebral gymnastics 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.320
 Vertebral exercises give vitality to weakened bones 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.140
 I stimulate the muscle around the shoulder 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.540
 I also work on the battle type of kidney system 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.960
 It is effective for stiff shoulders and diabetes 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.370
 Then we will actually do it 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.420
 First of all 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.470
 Open to shoulders a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.190
 Keep your knees stretched 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.930
 I will stick my butt back 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.809
 Ass out and make an arch on the star 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.130
 Do not bend your knees 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.290
 Foot is shoulder width 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.090
 Good to 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.270
 With palms stretched out 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.909
 Turn to the front 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.390
 At this time the palm has no economy 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.940
 From one time 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.050
 On the surface 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.510
 Turn power a 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.510
 Turn your palm to the front 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.380
 By the shoulder blade 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.380
 Depends on 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 next 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.530
 To the form that the right side leads 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.530
 I will raise my hand to the height of my shoulder 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.570
 That's a bit hard to get up 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.210
 This easily 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.210
 I can not lock the waist if it seems to be a bit 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.750
 Sticking out the butt 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.860
 I feel like I'm gathering power here- 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.860
 From a truck 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 Bring the bones apart a 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.250
 Buy a ring 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.340
 To be successful 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.650
 Once raised to the height of the shoulder 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.650
 Keep the attitude in this state 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.800
 Your fingertips 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.640
 Alternately left and right 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.110
 Make it stick out like this 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.470
 At this time 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:54.710
 Do not twist the body in such Fu 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.400
 Keeping the shape of the body and trying to make it white 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.930
 Only arms 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.060
 Only ahead 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.319
 Please tell me everything in a stretched state 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.960
 This silk thread in a position 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.090
 The lock was scattered 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.900
 10 seconds stimulated to over 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.900
 please let me down 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.150
 Make a big move 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.110
 So yeah 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.110
 It is the end- 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:34.170
 I will change the direction of the push again and this time will be done from the light 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.610
 Open your shoulders to your shoulders 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.290
 And 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:45.359
 Butt 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.379
 Stick out knees don't bend Keep knees down and pull back ass to make arch on waist 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.280
 Please 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:53.590
 This of the waist 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.960
 I will make the power gather in the part of the taste I will be in the state of locking this work 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.490
 And on my back 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.060
 So we gathered from that house 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.060
 next 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.350
 I have an arm from one time 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.970
 The day is good 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.970
 Open the outside and face the front 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.490
 Have 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.720
 This so because it depends shoulder blades 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.639
 A little so as to consciousness 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.630
 Because it is good 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.600
 Yes front 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.150
 And this say woman canal 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.249
 It looks like the above, so it looks a bit like this 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 To the height of this shoulder 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:42.640
 I will eat slowly 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.640
 When you come to shoulder height 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.290
 I agree 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.819
 By N 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.450
 To stimulate attention 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.450
 kill 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.090
 It is q 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.090
 f 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.969
 Will be very 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.150
 For example you 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:17.330
 The group's love from the use of the arm by continuing 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.330
 Also, as I mentioned earlier, it can be expected to be effective for forcing and ventilation. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.510
 that's all 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.510
 Thank you very much
