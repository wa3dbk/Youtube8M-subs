00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.949 

alright<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.680> in<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.979> last<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.909> we<00:00:03.419> study

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
alright so in the last video we study

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.430 
alright so in the last video we study
projections<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.830> shells<00:00:05.069> so<00:00:05.640> just<00:00:06.060> note<00:00:06.240> that

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
projections and shells so just note that

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.680 
projections and shells so just note that
the<00:00:07.440> game<00:00:07.649> projection<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.309> very<00:00:08.519> easy<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.540> go

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
the game projection is very easy and go

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.720 
the game projection is very easy and go
into<00:00:09.900> any<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> go<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.099> create

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
into any of you and I go to create

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.010 
into any of you and I go to create
planar<00:00:12.480> map<00:00:12.780> there's<00:00:13.500> my<00:00:13.710> projection<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
planar map there's my projection and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.740 
planar map there's my projection and
this<00:00:16.020> thing<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.619> did<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.920> show<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.600> what<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
this thing I did not show you what this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.429 
this thing I did not show you what this
thing<00:00:19.050> does<00:00:19.640> if<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.760> click<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.150> drag<00:00:21.390> down<00:00:21.779> or

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
thing does if I click and drag down or

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.830 
thing does if I click and drag down or
up<00:00:22.619> you're<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> find<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> UV

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
up you're going to find that in the UV

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.980 
up you're going to find that in the UV
texture<00:00:25.230> editor<00:00:25.350> space<00:00:26.150> all<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.750> doing

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
texture editor space all this is doing

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
texture editor space all this is doing
is<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> glorified<00:00:28.920> scale<00:00:29.390> okay<00:00:30.949> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is a glorified scale okay you can see is

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.510 
is a glorified scale okay you can see is
if<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.730> small<00:00:33.440> all<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.010> doing<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
if I get small all this is doing is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
if I get small all this is doing is
making<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:37.020> big<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.870> important<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
making this really big it's important to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.430 
making this really big it's important to
note<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:41.480> professionally<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.899> stay<00:00:43.230> within

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
note that professionally we stay within

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.729 
note that professionally we stay within
this<00:00:43.710> box<00:00:44.010> okay<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> lives<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> box

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this box okay so if it lives in the box

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.010 
this box okay so if it lives in the box
it's<00:00:47.010> good<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.820> good<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> port<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> any

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's good to go it's good to port in any

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.560 
it's good to go it's good to port in any
other<00:00:49.260> program<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.789> go<00:00:50.940> outside<00:00:51.149> at

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
other program but we don't go outside at

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
other program but we don't go outside at
this<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:52.050> area<00:00:52.289> right<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:55.129> well<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this little area right here well the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.840 
this little area right here well the
complexity<00:00:57.510> starts<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> shape

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
complexity starts when you get a shape

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
complexity starts when you get a shape
that<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:01.910> somewhat<00:01:02.910> complex<00:01:03.449> let's<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> i'm

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that is somewhat complex let's see i'm

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.230 
that is somewhat complex let's see i'm
just<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> add<00:01:05.129> some<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> character

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
just going to add some to this character

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:20.649 
just going to add some to this character
we're<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.650> two<00:01:08.100> second<00:01:08.580> body

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:45.590 

and<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.710> second<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.280> couple<00:01:22.310> arms<00:01:23.119> here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.179 

okay<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:48.200> now<00:01:50.450> what<00:01:51.450> happened

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
okay so there we go now what happened

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
okay so there we go now what happened
well<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> shape<00:01:53.580> doesn't<00:01:53.850> match<00:01:54.119> anymore<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
well the shape doesn't match anymore so

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
well the shape doesn't match anymore so
that's<00:01:55.080> step<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.680> does<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> shape<00:01:56.369> match<00:01:56.640> no

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that's step one does the shape match no

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840 
that's step one does the shape match no
well<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.440> happens<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.820> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
well what happens I can go in here and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:09.620 
well what happens I can go in here and
say<00:02:00.470> maybe<00:02:01.490> projective<00:02:02.490> camera<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.970> project

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
say maybe projective camera and project

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.410 
say maybe projective camera and project
it<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.649> represents<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.550> shape<00:02:11.760> but

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it well now it represents a shape but

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.059 
it well now it represents a shape but
what<00:02:12.660> happens<00:02:13.670> well<00:02:15.920> there's<00:02:16.920> distortion

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
what happens well there's distortion

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.590 
what happens well there's distortion
even<00:02:20.069> if<00:02:20.190> i<00:02:20.340> took<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.670> shell<00:02:20.940> let's<00:02:21.209> take<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
even if i took the shell let's take the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.190 
even if i took the shell let's take the
shell<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:23.360> cut<00:02:24.360> it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.699 

using<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.099> cut<00:02:30.310> command<00:02:30.580> here<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.349> then<00:02:32.349> take

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
using the cut command here and then take

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.410 
using the cut command here and then take
a<00:02:33.099> UV<00:02:33.819> using<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.629> UV<00:02:34.900> shell<00:02:35.140> tool<00:02:36.420> clicking

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
a UV using the UV shell tool clicking

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.520 
a UV using the UV shell tool clicking
off<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.840> drag<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.330> second<00:02:40.720> rule<00:02:40.989> besides

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
off the drag the second rule besides

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.009 
off the drag the second rule besides
like<00:02:42.250> staying<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.910> square<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.750> can't

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
like staying in the square is we can't

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.990 
like staying in the square is we can't
have<00:02:44.200> any<00:02:44.379> overlapping<00:02:44.890> movies<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.670> clearly

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
have any overlapping movies and clearly

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.770 
have any overlapping movies and clearly
you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.750> these<00:02:47.110> UV<00:02:47.970> these<00:02:48.970> faces<00:02:49.480> right<00:02:49.630> here

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
you know these UV these faces right here

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.130 
you know these UV these faces right here
if<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.530> click<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:55.360> see<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:55.780> they're

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
if I click on that you see that they're

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
if I click on that you see that they're
not<00:02:56.319> here<00:02:56.739> very<00:02:57.040> much<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.730> know<00:02:57.849> I<00:02:57.880> mean

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
not here very much you know I mean

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.390 
not here very much you know I mean
because<00:02:58.870> what<00:02:59.349> happens<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:02.190> they're<00:03:03.190> not

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
because what happens is they're not

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.809 
because what happens is they're not
represented<00:03:04.150> at<00:03:04.690> all<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:06.099> if<00:03:06.459> they<00:03:06.610> are

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
represented at all and if they are

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.420 
represented at all and if they are
they're<00:03:07.510> laying<00:03:07.720> flat<00:03:08.260> here<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.190> could

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
they're laying flat here and I could

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.970 
they're laying flat here and I could
never<00:03:09.579> put<00:03:09.880> any<00:03:10.030> texture<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.720> see<00:03:11.709> just

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
never put any texture in it see just

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.150 
never put any texture in it see just
like<00:03:12.099> this<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:13.290> can't<00:03:14.290> put<00:03:14.470> any<00:03:14.650> texture<00:03:15.069> in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
like this I can't put any texture in

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.860 
like this I can't put any texture in
this<00:03:15.280> area<00:03:15.519> because<00:03:15.640> there's<00:03:15.940> nowhere<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.630> put

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
this area because there's nowhere to put

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.420 
this area because there's nowhere to put
the<00:03:17.049> texture<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:20.079> leads<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.709> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
the texture at so this leads to the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.080 
the texture at so this leads to the
second<00:03:22.360> most<00:03:22.569> useful<00:03:22.959> tool<00:03:23.170> here<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.910> is

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
second most useful tool here and that is

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.180 
second most useful tool here and that is
the<00:03:25.269> unfold<00:03:25.780> command<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.620> what<00:03:26.890> I'm<00:03:26.980> going<00:03:27.069> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
the unfold command so what I'm going to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.380 
the unfold command so what I'm going to
do<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.790> click<00:03:28.239> double<00:03:29.140> click<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.560> line<00:03:29.799> here

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
do is click double click the line here

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.610 
do is click double click the line here
and<00:03:31.390> we're<00:03:32.230> going<00:03:32.319> to<00:03:32.380> say<00:03:34.739> unfold<00:03:35.739> UVs<00:03:36.160> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
and we're going to say unfold UVs and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.890 
and we're going to say unfold UVs and
they're<00:03:38.620> like<00:03:38.799> wow<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.459> was<00:03:39.639> horrible<00:03:40.030> okay

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
they're like wow that was horrible okay

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.340 
they're like wow that was horrible okay
well<00:03:41.500> there's<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.340> reason<00:03:42.400> for<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.359> let

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
well there's a reason for that and let

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.819 
well there's a reason for that and let
me<00:03:44.440> show<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.829> reason<00:03:45.930> notice<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.230> when<00:03:47.799> I

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
me show you that reason notice I when I

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.830 
me show you that reason notice I when I
do<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.310> both<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.329> them<00:03:49.420> squishes<00:03:49.900> down<00:03:50.190> okay

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
do this both of them squishes down okay

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.099 
do this both of them squishes down okay
so<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:53.319> order<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:54.010> counteract<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.700> if<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.959> go

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
so in order to counteract this if I go

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:02.970 
so in order to counteract this if I go
to<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.350> unfold<00:03:56.829> command<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:01.380> say<00:04:02.380> pin

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
to the unfold command and say pin

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.640 
to the unfold command and say pin
unselected<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:03.970> vs

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.500 

close<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.430> out<00:04:08.780> let's<00:04:09.780> go<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.989> UV<00:04:11.510> then

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
close that out let's go to UV then

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.300 
close that out let's go to UV then
unfold<00:04:13.819> ok<00:04:14.819> notice<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.480> something<00:04:15.949> one<00:04:16.949> got

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
unfold ok notice of something one got

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.099 
unfold ok notice of something one got
bloated<00:04:17.759> out<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.269> other<00:04:18.449> one<00:04:18.870> got

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
bloated out the other one got

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.850 
bloated out the other one got
introverted<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:20.269> well<00:04:21.269> that's<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.410> very<00:04:22.440> easy

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
introverted in well that's a very easy

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.740 
introverted in well that's a very easy
explanation<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.600> the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
explanation for this this is the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.460 
explanation for this this is the
positive<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.979> negative<00:04:26.220> shell

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
positive and this is the negative shell

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.260 
positive and this is the negative shell
okay<00:04:29.570> undo<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:31.530> counteract<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.240> what<00:04:33.240> I

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
okay undo to counteract that what I

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.920 
okay undo to counteract that what I
usually<00:04:33.600> do<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:33.990> take<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.650> shell<00:04:34.949> and<00:04:35.419> I<00:04:36.419> flip

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
usually do is take this shell and I flip

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:50.490 
usually do is take this shell and I flip
it<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:38.360> then<00:04:40.039> if<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.220> unfold<00:04:41.610> it

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.110 

grabbing<00:04:51.370> first<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.760> edge<00:04:52.950> then<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.280> UV<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:57.120> can

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
grabbing first the edge then to UV I can

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.540 
grabbing first the edge then to UV I can
unfold<00:04:58.420> it<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.750> now<00:04:59.440> this<00:04:59.740> time<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.130> blowed<00:05:00.400> it

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
unfold it and now this time it blowed it

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.000 
unfold it and now this time it blowed it
out<00:05:01.860> well<00:05:02.860> here's<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.820> problem<00:05:04.860> there's<00:05:05.860> a

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
out well here's the problem there's a

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.410 
out well here's the problem there's a
lot<00:05:06.190> of<00:05:06.220> problems<00:05:06.640> here<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:06.970> know<00:05:07.090> I<00:05:07.120> mean

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
lot of problems here you know I mean

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.970 
lot of problems here you know I mean
because<00:05:07.570> it's<00:05:07.720> like<00:05:08.080> problem<00:05:08.710> after<00:05:08.830> problem

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
because it's like problem after problem

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.030 
because it's like problem after problem
after<00:05:09.400> problem<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.960> problem<00:05:11.230> now<00:05:11.590> occurs

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
after problem so the problem now occurs

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.230 
after problem so the problem now occurs
is<00:05:12.310> its<00:05:12.910> unfolded<00:05:13.750> but<00:05:14.790> these<00:05:15.790> are<00:05:15.970> still

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
is its unfolded but these are still

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.120 
is its unfolded but these are still
stacked<00:05:16.540> up<00:05:16.720> on<00:05:16.870> top<00:05:16.930> of<00:05:17.290> each<00:05:17.410> other<00:05:17.560> so<00:05:17.970> I

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
stacked up on top of each other so I

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.830 
stacked up on top of each other so I
have<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.250> go<00:05:21.430> in<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:22.440> each<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.680> every<00:05:23.890> UV<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.840> W

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
have to go in to each and every UV and W

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.720 
have to go in to each and every UV and W
on<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.050> keyboard<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.560> move<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:28.350> now<00:05:29.350> they're

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
on the keyboard to move it now they're

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.520 
on the keyboard to move it now they're
they're<00:05:30.730> not<00:05:30.910> overlapping<00:05:31.419> but<00:05:32.080> I<00:05:32.140> still<00:05:32.380> get

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
they're not overlapping but I still get

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.890 
they're not overlapping but I still get
areas<00:05:32.890> of<00:05:33.040> overlapping<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:33.880> I<00:05:34.360> have<00:05:34.540> to<00:05:34.690> sit

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
areas of overlapping and I have to sit

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.260 
areas of overlapping and I have to sit
here<00:05:34.930> all<00:05:35.140> day<00:05:35.350> long<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:36.010> try<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:36.610> move<00:05:36.910> and

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
here all day long and try to move and

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.010 
here all day long and try to move and
manipulate<00:05:37.330> these<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.770> they<00:05:38.800> don't<00:05:40.020> overlap

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
manipulate these so they don't overlap

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.670 
manipulate these so they don't overlap
and<00:05:41.669> also<00:05:42.669> so<00:05:43.210> they're<00:05:43.360> uniformed<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.500> that's

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
and also so they're uniformed so that's

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.860 
and also so they're uniformed so that's
very<00:05:44.800> important<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.550> keep<00:05:45.820> uniformity<00:05:46.540> within

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
very important to keep uniformity within

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.830 
very important to keep uniformity within
your<00:05:47.560> texture<00:05:47.980> in<00:05:48.669> other<00:05:48.790> words<00:05:49.030> this<00:05:49.360> one<00:05:49.630> is

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
your texture in other words this one is

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.690 
your texture in other words this one is
now<00:05:50.050> sort<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.919> square<00:05:52.110> this<00:05:53.110> one<00:05:53.350> is<00:05:53.700> nothing

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
now sort of a square this one is nothing

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.930 
now sort of a square this one is nothing
sort<00:05:55.000> of<00:05:55.150> that<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:55.960> in<00:05:56.460> this<00:05:57.460> area<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:57.880> would

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
sort of that so in this area I would

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.880 
sort of that so in this area I would
have<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.270> hard<00:05:58.750> time<00:05:58.840> trying<00:05:59.290> to<00:05:59.440> get<00:05:59.530> texture

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
have a hard time trying to get texture

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.600 
have a hard time trying to get texture
in<00:06:00.130> here<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:02.500> in<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:02.830> next<00:06:02.950> video<00:06:03.340> I'm<00:06:03.460> going

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
in here so in the next video I'm going

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.210 
in here so in the next video I'm going
to<00:06:03.790> introduce<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.419> to<00:06:04.450> a<00:06:04.630> program<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.860> I'm

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
to introduce you to a program and I'm
