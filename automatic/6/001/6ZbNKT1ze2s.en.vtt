00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.830
 I want to draw your attention also to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.250
 shoe sole shoe sole must be 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 quite elastic while she 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.739
 must have a certain thickness 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.260
 the sole of the shoe should not be more than 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.550
 7 8 millimeters is a must 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.190
 otherwise all pebbles 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.320
 on which you will walk 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.960
 work on the insole 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.440
 shoe and thus reduce and 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 wear resistance will be easy to wash 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.080
 time quickly enough to crumble 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.199
 again I want to draw on one more 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.199
 shoe sole feature for adults 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.080
 much more flexible if you can pay 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.180
 attention than footwear for kids 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.340
 it too has its under it it too 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.560
 this is a certain basis and 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.850
 certain necessity the thing is 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.020
 that children's foot it is more mobile and in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 same time due to the fact that her joints 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.679
 are not yet fully developed 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.229
 the likelihood of problems such 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.140
 like tucking baby's feet 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.299
 increase significantly and more 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.859
 tight fit and less elastic 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.929
 sole but at the same time anyway 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.270
 bending soles wanna draw your 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:51.159
 attention to the sole which is good 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.530
 bends provides child foot 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.030
 good high stability if we 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.439
 take a look at closed shoes 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.219
 meters and see that it is enough 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.250
 elastic and bent on in those 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.020
 places that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 usually work is approximately 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.600
 middle third 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.070
 Shoe this in any will not only in 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.070
 orthopedic this principle applies
