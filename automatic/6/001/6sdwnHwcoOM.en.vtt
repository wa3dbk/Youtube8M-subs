 that what the installation does in the 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.949
 mobile is to say that it stays in the 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.039
 mobile once we turn off the terminal 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.739
 then yes that is the application for 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.289
 execute it let's say every time it's like a 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.729
 executable program but not found 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.620
 in the application for installed as 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.570
 I can say then the only one 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.310
 we have to do is execute it every time 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.260
 that we want to do something with that mode 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.510
 advanced recovery then nothing the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.630
 file you have a description 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.670
 you will find the file and the file in 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 question is this I'm going to show you what 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.180
 the word club for the models, yes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.390
 c &amp; m then we have to turn off the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 phone 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.390
 by the way if you are liking this rom 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.790
 what you see is a little different is the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.160
 of the samsung galaxy s 4 it seemed having 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.020
 the one he used like this is 5 and you'll have it 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.270
 also here in some video or 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.560
 the description of I'll leave it right now 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.060
 the phone was paid then not 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 we have to do more than put it in 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.490
 recovery mode for the models and I made myself 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.590
 ejecting the button up some the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 home button and the power 2 button 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.490
 we press all three at once 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.110
 we do not wait for the letters of the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.150
 model and as you can see is a model 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 today and now we are not waiting for three 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.420
 seconds like that and we can drop all the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.270
 keys at the same time 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.490
 then we let go and we wait for 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 it starts 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.069
 follow the letters again and how can you 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.069
 see is the model and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.590
 and we are already in the recovery mode this is 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.050
 the recovery mode that comes from the factory 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.580
 samsung galaxy 6 then nothing if 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 you want to install the install bonus 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.580

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.470
 Recovery would be the club iphone sdk the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.960
 second option we download some keys 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.850
 volume up and down and we select 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.310
 with the home button 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.580
 then select the theater foundation 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.130
 jail month we give ok and we go to 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.860
 where we have it I have it in this 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.860

 balloon recovery in version 5 026 for 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.800

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.870
 so good if you find some 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.580
 file that really leaves it to a 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.100
 persistent installation within the 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.110
