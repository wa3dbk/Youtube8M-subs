kind of there and as for three I've been

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.380 
kind of there and as for three I've been
meaning<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> play<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.180> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
been lost in the game literally so I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.139

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.990 
really don't know where I'm going but
I'll<00:00:42.629> probably<00:00:43.350> play<00:00:44.160> even<00:00:44.520> more<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
