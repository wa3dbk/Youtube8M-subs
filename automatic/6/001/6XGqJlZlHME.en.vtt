00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
more like summer and it matches nice

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.620

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
cover basically I don't know if you can

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.220

pick<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.930> them<00:02:14.000> camera<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.050> womb

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
pick that up on them camera but the womb

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.430 
pick that up on them camera but the womb
on<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> watch<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.820> why<00:02:18.510> White<00:02:19.020> Queen

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
on the watch is also why White Queen

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.180 
on the watch is also why White Queen
it's<00:02:19.890> dark<00:02:20.459> greens<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:21.120> white<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.950> light

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it's dark greens not white it's a light

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.000 
it's dark greens not white it's a light
green<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.770> matches

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
green just like this one so it matches

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.350 
green just like this one so it matches
nicely<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.239> won't<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:30.120> gonna

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
nicely and what that won't do I'm gonna

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.800 
nicely and what that won't do I'm gonna
switch<00:02:30.989> these<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.980> course<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.600> wanna

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
switch these of course but I just wanna

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.039 
switch these of course but I just wanna
keep<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.410> watch<00:02:34.680> default<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.090> either<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:37.019> of

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
keep this watch default on either one of

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.560 
keep this watch default on either one of
these<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:38.489> do<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.760> think<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.120> think<00:02:39.390> it's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
these so what do you think I think it's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.670 
these so what do you think I think it's
kind<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.880> green<00:02:42.180> shoots<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.140> more<00:02:43.380> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
kind of the green shoots it's more and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.800 
kind of the green shoots it's more and
this<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.630> also<00:02:45.630> 5<00:02:46.560> watts<00:02:46.830> watch<00:02:47.600> Navi<00:02:48.600> be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
this is a also 5 watts watch Navi be
