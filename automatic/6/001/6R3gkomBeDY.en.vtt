00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.669
 I'm going to show you how you can make a guide 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.930
 of hearts is for any occasion 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:16.430
 valentine or to decorate that event 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.860
 it's very easy super cheap and it's just 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.789
 a little cut for this we're going to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.109
 need the following 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.750
 we are going to need a Chinese paper of 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.660
 red color you can do it from another 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.469
 color if you want to interspersed with 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.199
 blue white rosita which is the color that 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.570
 you want the Chinese paper other than being 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.290
 economic this will also leave us 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.420
 a lot then do not worry 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.370
 Here is the statement I made a statement 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.640
 nothing else I will occupy a piece for this 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.189
 moment to show you how it is we are going to 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.720
 grab the size of our hand 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.720
 A) Yes 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.710
 and let's do the following we're going to 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.460
 cut out in this part of here is how 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.330
 what about 1012 centimeters and if you look and what 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.330
 let's cut 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 we're just going to need glue scissors 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.829
 a little or cold silicone 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.950
 the paper that will occupy there what 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.280
 you can fill in a thread of clothes and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 those who occupy for things the clothes or 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.289
 You can also buy a transparent one 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.619
 how are they for the balloons already depends 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.000
 well this what we are going to need 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.909
 now that we have the paper already 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.049
 cut we're going to do the following 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.920
 let's grab just one half of that and 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:55.000
 we are going to measure it as the size of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.540
 about seven centimeters let's calculate 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 A) Yes 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.880
 this is double and here we are going to do 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.420
 the next thing we're going to double it to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420
 in 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.120
 and I was left with the line that we had to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.460
 we have here and we doubled a little 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.000
 A) Yes 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.870
 and later 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.870
 we are going to do it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.760
 since it 's like that now we're going inside 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.030
 and so we 're going to go with all the paper 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 once we have finished 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.129
 Bend 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.890
 it does not have to stay like this now well let's go 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.909
 you I will make an indelible to 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.800
 that you see what is the design and the form 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.950
 that has to have 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 good quickly 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.970
 let's do this this part of here 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.790
 let's leave a bit we're going to do 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.430
 A line 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.430
 since this line now we are going to do 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.650
 two lines and we're going to put them together 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.630
 let's leave a small space and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.630
 we make two other lines 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.900
 and now that there is this line we are going to 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.610
 make another small space and we're going to 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.610
 do as half of the heart 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:41.430
 here it is 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.430
 and now we are going to make another line here 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.190
 we close and what we are going to do another 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.350
 space and here we are going to make another 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.780
 heart 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.040
 and we are going in the middle of these two we are going to 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.579
 do 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.579
 this 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.530
 and so we have to stay 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.980
 since this is now with scissors 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.130
 very carefully we are going to cut this 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.380
 part of here we will go for all 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.940
 the lines 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.800
 very carefully 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.130
 trying not to move so much the 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.130
 paper 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.710
 racing 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.470
 and then so 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.710
 and so we're going to follow all the whole 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.449
 line 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.819
 okay 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.819
 well, here we have it cut out 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.740
 since we have it like this now we are going to 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.750
 do the following this time I did it with 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.390
 indelible so that you would notice 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.030
 what were the strokes but so that 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.880
 you stay like this you can take a pencil and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.500
 perfectly going to come out then we 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.500
 the guts are going to come out like that 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.620
 that's how it has to be 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.500
 it's very easy and here is your heart 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.320
 the little hearts 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.230
 it's cheap from a Chinese paper you're going to 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.680
 leave many and well this part of here 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.980
 we're going to have to fold and put 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.340
 our thread in this part of here we go 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.040
 here I camilo with a little pegas 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.640
 little bit of resistol or what you have as 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.440
 cold silicone you're going to put it here in 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.530
 this part of here look I 'm going to teach you 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.030
 like here only but little like that 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.420
 almost almost nothing and you're going to fold it and so 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.490
 you will continue with all your guide 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.970
 until you stay 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.600
 well and good of this bit we 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.560
 they came out 1 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.560
 here is the other 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.350
 3 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:22.470
 4 566 pieces with only one 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.950
 bit then if we calculate a 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:32.590
 Chinese paper a sheet of paper must 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:37.469
 go out as some 60 to 80 pieces 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:41.469
 of a Chinese paper and it's a nice thing 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:45.360
 original also super economic and then 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.360
 so it has to look like this 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.730
 Well, if you liked this video
