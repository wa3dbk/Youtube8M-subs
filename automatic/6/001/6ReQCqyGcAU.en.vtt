stronger<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.660> architecture<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.940> turns<00:00:57.510> out

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
stronger in architecture it turns out

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.950 
stronger in architecture it turns out
that<00:00:57.930> he<00:00:58.140> has<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.530> incredible<00:00:59.250> uncanny<00:01:00.210> sense

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that he has an incredible uncanny sense

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.130
