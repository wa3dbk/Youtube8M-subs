systems<00:00:43.579> within<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:43.999> body<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.050> make<00:00:45.350> a

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
systems within the body so to make a

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.319 
systems within the body so to make a
long<00:00:45.530> story<00:00:45.710> short<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.579> have<00:00:46.909> been<00:00:47.089> craving

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
long story short I have been craving

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.630 
long story short I have been craving
salt<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:48.079> was<00:00:48.230> prescribed<00:00:48.710> Himalayan<00:00:49.280> salt

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
salt and was prescribed Himalayan salt

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.180 
salt and was prescribed Himalayan salt
which<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:49.999> a<00:00:50.030> good<00:00:50.269> salt<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.809> also<00:00:51.649> magnesium

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
which is a good salt and also magnesium

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.349 
which is a good salt and also magnesium
and<00:00:52.309> potassium<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:54.249> that<00:00:55.249> was<00:00:55.550> why<00:00:55.999> I<00:00:56.329> was

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
and potassium and that was why I was

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.479 
and potassium and that was why I was
craving<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.989> potato<00:00:57.289> chips<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.769> this<00:00:58.280> really

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
craving the potato chips and this really

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.790 
craving the potato chips and this really
crazy<00:00:58.940> how<00:00:59.359> your<00:00:59.659> body<00:01:00.019> will<00:01:00.440> make<00:01:00.679> you

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
crazy how your body will make you

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.459 
crazy how your body will make you
gravitate<00:01:01.399> towards<00:01:01.999> certain<00:01:02.239> foods<00:01:02.690> if<00:01:02.960> it's

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
gravitate towards certain foods if it's

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.350 
gravitate towards certain foods if it's
something<00:01:03.739> lacking<00:01:04.190> within<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.059> if<00:01:05.150> you

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
something lacking within and so if you

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.499 
something lacking within and so if you
are<00:01:05.860> gravitating<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.130> our<00:01:07.220> sugar<00:01:07.610> there<00:01:08.270> might

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
are gravitating to our sugar there might

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.330 
are gravitating to our sugar there might
be<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.719> reason<00:01:09.079> why<00:01:09.110> you're<00:01:09.439> doing<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:10.219> if

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
be a reason why you're doing that and if

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.130 
be a reason why you're doing that and if
you<00:01:10.490> are<00:01:10.640> gravitating<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.450> our<00:01:11.540> salt<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.990> may

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
you are gravitating to our salt you may

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.780 
you are gravitating to our salt you may
be<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.530> me<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:12.950> someone<00:01:13.280> who<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.399> deficient

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
be like me and someone who is deficient

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.730 
be like me and someone who is deficient
in<00:01:14.060> salt<00:01:14.360> what<00:01:15.079> am<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.570> going<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.960> crave<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.380 
of the potato chips out there are fried
in<00:01:32.090> our<00:01:32.689> vegetable<00:01:33.409> oils<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.090> funny

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
in our vegetable oils and the funny

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.480 
in our vegetable oils and the funny
thing<00:01:35.719> about<00:01:35.750> vegetable<00:01:36.560> oils<00:01:36.859> is<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.219> a

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
thing about vegetable oils is that a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.300 
thing about vegetable oils is that a
long<00:01:38.299> time<00:01:38.359> ago<00:01:38.689> we<00:01:39.200> used<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.619> fry<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:39.859> lot<00:01:40.159> of

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
long time ago we used to fry a lot of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.130 
long time ago we used to fry a lot of
things<00:01:40.490> in<00:01:40.670> what<00:01:40.700> we<00:01:40.969> call<00:01:41.149> saturated<00:01:41.899> fats

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
things in what we call saturated fats

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.440 
things in what we call saturated fats
like<00:01:42.259> beef<00:01:42.619> tallow<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.310> instance<00:01:43.670> McDonald's

like beef tallow for instance McDonald's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.999 
like beef tallow for instance McDonald's
used<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.689> fight<00:01:44.899> fry<00:01:45.259> their<00:01:45.469> french<00:01:45.740> fries<00:01:45.979> in

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
market heart disease took a rise our

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.410 
market heart disease took a rise our
bodies<00:02:03.200> are<00:02:03.229> not<00:02:03.560> used<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.280> corn<00:02:04.609> oils<00:02:05.119> or
