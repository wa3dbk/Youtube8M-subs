this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.080> number<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.680> call<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
this is number one I call it the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.820 
this is number one I call it the
alleyway<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> corridor<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
alleyway if you will the corridor of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.189 
alleyway if you will the corridor of
death<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.970> weapons<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> walk<00:00:27.810> across<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
death and weapons as you walk across the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.120 
death and weapons as you walk across the
pressure<00:00:28.410> plate<00:00:29.539> fall<00:00:30.539> down<00:00:30.750> into<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.560> where

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pressure plate fall down into here where

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.830 
pressure plate fall down into here where
you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.550> lava<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:33.180> whatever<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you can have lava or whatever you want a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.650 
you can have lava or whatever you want a
pit<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.350> death<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.250> put<00:00:35.880> la<00:00:36.030> vie<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
pit into death we can put la vie for a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.299 
pit into death we can put la vie for a
lava<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.710> brutally

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
lava because then it could just brutally

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.160 
lava because then it could just brutally
brutally<00:00:38.579> murder<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.180> that's<00:00:39.899> pretty<00:00:40.020> much

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
brutally murder them that's pretty much

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
brutally murder them that's pretty much
it<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.460> ready<00:00:41.640> gonna<00:00:41.760> make

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it for that one that we ready gonna make

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.420 
it for that one that we ready gonna make
it<00:00:42.030> past<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> corridor<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.160> I'll<00:00:44.160> graphing

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it past that corridor and I'll graphing

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.610 
it past that corridor and I'll graphing
any<00:00:44.579> ones<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:45.239> specials<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.500> can

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
any ones I think specials there you can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
any ones I think specials there you can
also<00:00:46.739> put<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> door<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.430> open<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> door<00:00:47.940> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
also put a door here so open the door so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
also put a door here so open the door so
it<00:00:48.390> puts<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> illusion<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> something<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it puts the illusion of something that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.799 
it puts the illusion of something that
were<00:00:50.550> supposed<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.910> walking<00:00:51.090> past<00:00:51.539> like

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
were supposed to be walking past like

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
were supposed to be walking past like
they<00:00:52.350> walk<00:00:52.500> through<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> falls<00:00:53.640> down<00:00:53.730> like

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
they walk through and it falls down like

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
they walk through and it falls down like
that<00:00:54.180> much<00:00:54.870> better<00:00:55.050> illusion<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.829> hop<00:00:56.430> over

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that much better illusion so we hop over

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240 
that much better illusion so we hop over
there<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.879> sure<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> make<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.649> alrighty<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.010> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
there and sure to make it alrighty so so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.380 
there and sure to make it alrighty so so
this<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> show<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this is just going to show you how to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.709 
this is just going to show you how to
make<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> corridor<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> death<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.719> pretty

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
make the corridor of death so pretty

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.000 
make the corridor of death so pretty
simple<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.199> you're<00:01:04.619> gonna<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
simple to make you're gonna need a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
simple to make you're gonna need a
couple<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> things<00:01:05.689> first<00:01:06.689> off<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> need

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
is a piston that you're gonna have a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.780 
is a piston that you're gonna have a
head<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.920> doesn't<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> sticky

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
head and it doesn't have to be a sticky

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
head and it doesn't have to be a sticky
piston<00:01:11.970> by<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.200> any<00:01:13.320> person

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
piston by the way it can be any person

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.469 
piston by the way it can be any person
you<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.189> using<00:01:14.700> sticky<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.299> that's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you want using sticky because that's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
you want using sticky because that's
what<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> put<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.590> ahead<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:22.159> this

person ask you one more further in it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.410 
person ask you one more further in it's
a<00:01:26.220> bit<00:01:26.340> annoying<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.759> piston<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
a bit annoying this piston what you have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.830 
a bit annoying this piston what you have
to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.130> works<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:30.630> once

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to do with it but it works so now once

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.520 
to do with it but it works so now once
that's<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:32.280> ahead<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:34.200> fill

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that's like that go ahead and just fill

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
that's like that go ahead and just fill
in<00:01:34.680> underneath<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> piston<00:01:36.259> like<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.939> like

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
in underneath the piston like so like

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
in underneath the piston like so like
that<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.900> sticky<00:01:40.530> piston<00:01:40.710> or

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that so you have a a sticky piston or

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.620 
that so you have a a sticky piston or
regular<00:01:41.280> piston<00:01:41.430> facing<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
regular piston facing out like that and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.730 
regular piston facing out like that and
you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.619> fill<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.549> yeah<00:01:45.740> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you can fill this in at the back yeah so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.810 
you can fill this in at the back yeah so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
your redstone redstone dust just a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.870 
your redstone redstone dust just a
1-piece<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.340> need<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.820> you

1-piece that's all we need that if you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.359 
1-piece that's all we need that if you
don't<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.299> weirdly<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:04.369> go

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
don't have weirdly and put that there go

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.460 
don't have weirdly and put that there go
ahead<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:08.090> place<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.119> block<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.810> top<00:02:10.200> like

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
ahead and place your block on top like

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.750 
ahead and place your block on top like
so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.979 
so
and<00:02:12.260> place<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.290> block<00:02:13.620> behind<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.780> like<00:02:15.780> that

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
and place your block behind it like that

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.020 
and place your block behind it like that
now<00:02:16.409> go<00:02:16.590> ahead<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.829> go<00:02:16.920> down<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.310> break<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
now go ahead and go down here break this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.360 
now go ahead and go down here break this
block<00:02:18.299> here<00:02:18.480> put<00:02:18.689> a<00:02:18.720> redstone<00:02:19.019> torch<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.590> let's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
block here put a redstone torch it let's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.059 
block here put a redstone torch it let's
go<00:02:20.519> ahead<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.849> push<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.150> out<00:02:21.239> like<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
go ahead and push it out like that and

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.580 
go ahead and push it out like that and
now<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.129> can<00:02:23.189> cover<00:02:23.489> up<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> sand<00:02:24.659> like

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
now you can cover up with the sand like

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.360 
now you can cover up with the sand like
so<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.879> your<00:02:27.000> pressure<00:02:27.209> plate<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.629> like<00:02:27.959> this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
so put your pressure plate on like this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.869 
so put your pressure plate on like this
and<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.549> walk<00:02:29.700> over<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.470> walk<00:02:31.470> off<00:02:31.879> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
and if you walk over it walk off the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.940 
and if you walk over it walk off the
piston<00:02:33.780> will<00:02:33.900> go<00:02:33.989> back<00:02:34.170> quickly<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:34.829> go

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
piston will go back quickly and then go

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.649 
piston will go back quickly and then go
back<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.250> normal<00:02:35.489> now<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.299> go<00:02:36.390> ahead<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
back to normal now you can go ahead and

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.440 
back to normal now you can go ahead and
get<00:02:36.810> your<00:02:36.900> torches<00:02:37.409> or<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.940> should<00:02:39.299> talk

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
get your torches or you should talk

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.229 
get your torches or you should talk
torch<00:02:40.319> woman<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:40.859> signs<00:02:41.250> go<00:02:42.000> ahead<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
torch woman about signs go ahead and

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.630 
torch woman about signs go ahead and
place<00:02:42.390> them<00:02:42.569> all<00:02:42.750> along<00:02:43.019> here<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.549> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
place them all along here now I in the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.729 
place them all along here now I in the
pit<00:02:44.849> below<00:02:45.120> me<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.329> can<00:02:45.569> place<00:02:45.810> lava<00:02:46.109> if<00:02:46.620> you

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
pit below me you can place lava if you

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.009 
pit below me you can place lava if you
want<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.950> kill<00:02:47.099> them<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.609> want<00:02:47.819> to

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
want to kill them or if you just want to

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.470 
want to kill them or if you just want to
drop<00:02:49.019> them<00:02:49.170> down<00:02:49.319> there<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.769> do<00:02:49.859> over

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
drop them down there you can do over

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.970 
drop them down there you can do over
sand<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.629> gravel<00:02:51.810> walk<00:02:52.170> across<00:02:52.319> way<00:02:52.620> here<00:02:52.859> you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
sand or gravel walk across way here you

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280 
sand or gravel walk across way here you
can<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.430> gravel<00:02:53.819> but<00:02:54.450> I've<00:02:54.569> hurt<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.989> son

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
can use gravel but I've hurt you son

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.069 
can use gravel but I've hurt you son
because<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.590> looks<00:02:55.980> much<00:02:56.190> cooler<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.900> put

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
because it looks much cooler you put

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.670 
because it looks much cooler you put
your<00:02:58.200> daughter<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.859> illusion<00:02:59.340> or<00:02:59.760> cross

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
your daughter for the illusion or cross

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.349 
your daughter for the illusion or cross
and<00:03:01.680> boom<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.519> fall<00:03:02.700> down<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:02.879> die<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
and boom they fall down and die on the

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.960 
and boom they fall down and die on the
lava<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.349> quickly<00:03:04.769> moving<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.639> second

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
lava so quickly moving on to the second

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.869 
lava so quickly moving on to the second
here<00:03:06.180> very<00:03:06.569> basic<00:03:06.989> here<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.370> do<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.700> walk

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
here very basic here what you do is walk

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.960 
here very basic here what you do is walk
across<00:03:09.030> here<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:10.549> you<00:03:11.549> get<00:03:11.670> trapped<00:03:11.879> like

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
across here and you get trapped like

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.119 
across here and you get trapped like
this<00:03:12.269> obviously<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.470> temporary<00:03:13.829> woman

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
this obviously this is a temporary woman

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.379 
this obviously this is a temporary woman
because<00:03:14.310> they<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.639> break<00:03:14.849> out<00:03:15.060> all<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.269> earth

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
because they can break out all the earth

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.509 
because they can break out all the earth
to<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.629> is<00:03:15.810> break<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.680> pressure<00:03:16.889> plate<00:03:17.190> below

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
to do is break the pressure plate below

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.000 
to do is break the pressure plate below
them<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:18.569> uh<00:03:18.720> that's<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:19.919> of<00:03:19.980> a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
them that's uh that's just more of a

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.189 
them that's uh that's just more of a
temporary<00:03:20.190> trap<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> does<00:03:21.299> work<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.109> this

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
temporary trap and it does work so this

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.289 
temporary trap and it does work so this
is<00:03:22.379> how<00:03:22.500> everybody<00:03:22.709> pretty<00:03:23.129> much<00:03:23.310> works<00:03:23.579> to

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
is how everybody pretty much works to

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.839 
is how everybody pretty much works to
make<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.650> 3x3<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.449> in<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.660> ground<00:03:28.849> break

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
make a 3x3 like so in the ground break

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.089 
make a 3x3 like so in the ground break
one<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.180> middle<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.780> make<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.109> cross<00:03:31.680> like

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
one in the middle and make a cross like

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.520 
one in the middle and make a cross like
that<00:03:32.569> redstone<00:03:33.569> in<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.049> middle<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.440> make

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
that redstone in the middle and make

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.199 
that redstone in the middle and make
sure<00:03:34.680> there's<00:03:34.889> sticky<00:03:35.190> pistons<00:03:35.669> facing<00:03:35.879> up

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
sure there's sticky pistons facing up

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.949 
sure there's sticky pistons facing up
all<00:03:36.449> the<00:03:36.569> way<00:03:36.660> around<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.169> like<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.310> then

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
all the way around it like so and then

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.059 
all the way around it like so and then
just<00:03:39.959> go<00:03:40.290> ahead<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.560> cover<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.799> whole<00:03:41.040> thing

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
just go ahead and cover the whole thing

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.009 
just go ahead and cover the whole thing
up<00:03:42.199> and<00:03:43.199> place<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.010> pressure<00:03:44.400> plate<00:03:44.840> in<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
up and place a pressure plate in the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
the back and sort out the wiring so you

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.750 
the back and sort out the wiring so you
can<00:04:45.410> build<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.710> little<00:04:45.860> thing<00:04:46.190> out<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.580> this

just<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.390> see<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.630> pistons<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.260> want

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
just so you can see the pistons I want

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.370 
just so you can see the pistons I want
to<00:04:49.130> build<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.370> row<00:04:49.640> in<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.850> middle<00:04:50.060> like<00:04:50.270> that

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
to build a row in the middle like that

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.600 
to build a row in the middle like that
put<00:04:51.380> redstone<00:04:51.590> all<00:04:52.040> across<00:04:52.310> here<00:04:54.310> torch<00:04:55.310> torch

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
put redstone all across here torch torch

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.640 
put redstone all across here torch torch
torch<00:04:55.790> torch<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.140> should<00:04:57.290> push<00:04:57.440> out<00:04:57.620> all

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
torch torch and that should push out all

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.970 
torch torch and that should push out all
the<00:04:57.830> pistons<00:04:58.360> from<00:04:59.360> here<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:00.320> they<00:05:00.440> will<00:05:00.830> be<00:05:00.950> in

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
the pistons from here so they will be in

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.980 
the pistons from here so they will be in
line<00:05:01.370> now<00:05:03.070> right<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:04.250> now<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.400> want<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:04.990> this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.750 
line now right so now you want to this
is<00:05:06.050> why<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.290> recommend<00:05:06.680> building<00:05:06.800> walls<00:05:07.310> across

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
is why I recommend building walls across

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.490 
is why I recommend building walls across
here<00:05:08.030> like<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.480> but<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.870> do<00:05:09.080> have<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.320> show<00:05:09.470> a

here like this but you do have to show a
bit<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.710> redstone<00:05:09.920> wiring<00:05:10.720> dinner<00:05:11.720> why<00:05:11.870> it

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
bit of redstone wiring dinner why it

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.980 
bit of redstone wiring dinner why it
does<00:05:12.200> doesn't<00:05:12.410> work<00:05:12.680> if<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:12.920> don't<00:05:13.840> go<00:05:14.840> and

holes<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.320> they<00:05:45.410> die<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:46.460> now<00:05:46.610> at<00:05:46.760> the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
holes in and they die so now at the

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.200 
holes in and they die so now at the
fourth<00:05:47.330> one<00:05:47.750> I'm<00:05:48.200> going<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.410> go<00:05:48.500> ahead<00:05:48.620> and

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
fourth one I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.640 
fourth one I'm going to go ahead and
look<00:05:50.210> around<00:05:50.300> here<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:50.810> you<00:05:50.900> think<00:05:51.110> oh<00:05:51.260> look<00:05:51.560> a

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
look around here and you think oh look a

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.390 
look around here and you think oh look a
door<00:05:51.920> let's<00:05:52.190> go<00:05:52.340> into<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:53.230> pull<00:05:54.230> down<00:05:54.410> into<00:05:55.340> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
door let's go into it pull down into the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.160 
door let's go into it pull down into the
lava<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.760> die<00:05:56.000> this<00:05:56.270> one's<00:05:56.420> a<00:05:56.480> very<00:05:56.570> basic<00:05:56.840> one

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
lava and die this one's a very basic one

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.410 
lava and die this one's a very basic one
doesn't<00:05:57.560> really<00:05:57.680> look<00:05:57.800> like<00:05:57.860> it<00:05:58.160> but<00:05:58.250> it<00:05:58.310> is<00:05:58.520> so

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
doesn't really look like it but it is so

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.150 
doesn't really look like it but it is so
there's<00:06:00.200> just<00:06:00.260> a<00:06:00.410> bit<00:06:00.530> of<00:06:00.620> wiring<00:06:00.890> underneath

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
there's just a bit of wiring underneath

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.010 
there's just a bit of wiring underneath
with<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.430> piston<00:06:01.790> there<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.330> let's<00:06:02.630> go<00:06:02.780> hop

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
with the piston there and let's go hop

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.710 
with the piston there and let's go hop
over<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.350> show<00:06:03.770> you<00:06:03.800> right<00:06:04.070> now<00:06:04.390> so<00:06:05.390> you<00:06:05.420> have

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
over and show you right now so you have

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.560 
over and show you right now so you have
a<00:06:05.990> your<00:06:06.350> basic<00:06:06.710> doorframe<00:06:07.100> again<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:07.580> you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
a your basic doorframe again and you

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.150 
a your basic doorframe again and you
wanna<00:06:08.720> have<00:06:08.960> a<00:06:09.050> little<00:06:09.140> pit<00:06:09.440> dug<00:06:09.680> next<00:06:10.040> to<00:06:10.100> it

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
wanna have a little pit dug next to it

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.580 
wanna have a little pit dug next to it
like<00:06:10.220> this<00:06:10.460> just<00:06:10.670> two<00:06:10.880> down<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.500> you're<00:06:12.500> gonna

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
like this just two down and you're gonna

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.030 
like this just two down and you're gonna
follow<00:06:12.800> I<00:06:12.920> do<00:06:13.100> piston<00:06:14.030> like<00:06:14.150> that<00:06:15.010> break<00:06:16.010> a

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
follow I do piston like that break a

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.700 
follow I do piston like that break a
block<00:06:16.250> break<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.610> locks<00:06:16.760> behind<00:06:16.940> it

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
block break the locks behind it

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.740 
block break the locks behind it
torch<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:18.950> it<00:06:19.040> pushes<00:06:19.340> out<00:06:19.490> block<00:06:20.270> your<00:06:20.510> choice

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
torch so it pushes out block your choice

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.659 
torch so it pushes out block your choice
put<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.830> down<00:06:21.950> there<00:06:22.240> redstone<00:06:23.240> torch<00:06:23.510> in<00:06:23.690> it

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
put it down there redstone torch in it

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.850 
put it down there redstone torch in it
it's<00:06:25.669> doing<00:06:25.880> whirring<00:06:26.300> going<00:06:27.220> like<00:06:28.220> this<00:06:29.860> into

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
it's doing whirring going like this into

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.470 
it's doing whirring going like this into
a<00:06:31.130> block<00:06:31.730> which<00:06:32.510> we<00:06:32.750> will<00:06:32.900> place<00:06:33.169> down<00:06:34.000> like<00:06:35.000> so

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
a block which we will place down like so

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.420 
a block which we will place down like so
like<00:06:36.410> that<00:06:36.650> so<00:06:36.919> it's<00:06:37.040> just<00:06:37.070> a<00:06:37.310> little

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
like that so it's just a little

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.460 
like that so it's just a little
circuitry<00:06:38.060> go<00:06:38.750> ahead<00:06:38.870> and<00:06:38.960> break<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.200> torch

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
circuitry go ahead and break this torch

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.090 
circuitry go ahead and break this torch
now<00:06:40.419> fill<00:06:41.419> it<00:06:41.510> in<00:06:41.630> like<00:06:41.780> that<00:06:41.960> go<00:06:42.860> ahead<00:06:42.890> and

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
now fill it in like that go ahead and

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.520 
now fill it in like that go ahead and
place<00:06:43.280> your<00:06:43.510> pressure<00:06:44.510> plate<00:06:44.810> on<00:06:44.960> top<00:06:45.230> and<00:06:45.470> you

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
place your pressure plate on top and you

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.200 
place your pressure plate on top and you
can<00:06:45.620> cover<00:06:45.800> all<00:06:46.010> this<00:06:46.130> up<00:06:46.190> like<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:46.820> have<00:06:46.970> over

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
can cover all this up like I have over

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.850 
can cover all this up like I have over
there<00:06:47.450> with<00:06:47.840> a<00:06:47.870> couple<00:06:48.140> of<00:06:48.169> half-steps<00:06:48.500> things

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
there with a couple of half-steps things

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.640 
there with a couple of half-steps things
of<00:06:48.950> that<00:06:49.070> but<00:06:49.280> now<00:06:49.430> if<00:06:50.180> you<00:06:50.210> step<00:06:50.540> on<00:06:50.660> it<00:06:50.810> it

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
of that but now if you step on it it

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.650 
of that but now if you step on it it
breaks<00:06:51.830> down<00:06:52.160> and<00:06:52.880> you<00:06:53.120> can<00:06:53.210> have<00:06:53.300> your<00:06:53.390> pit<00:06:53.570> of

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
breaks down and you can have your pit of

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.750 
breaks down and you can have your pit of
lava<00:06:53.690> just<00:06:54.169> below<00:06:54.440> it<00:06:54.560> like<00:06:54.680> so<00:06:54.950> and<00:06:55.160> I'll<00:06:55.550> fall

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
lava just below it like so and I'll fall

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.630 
lava just below it like so and I'll fall
and<00:06:55.910> die<00:06:56.150> very<00:06:56.660> basic<00:06:57.169> very<00:06:57.380> simple<00:06:57.460> now<00:06:58.460> we're

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
and die very basic very simple now we're

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.130 
and die very basic very simple now we're
going<00:06:58.729> to<00:06:58.790> quickly<00:06:59.000> move<00:06:59.240> on<00:06:59.360> to<00:06:59.690> the<00:06:59.780> last<00:06:59.960> one

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.140 
going to quickly move on to the last one

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.870 
going to quickly move on to the last one
hand<00:07:00.380> though<00:07:00.500> this<00:07:00.590> is<00:07:00.740> a<00:07:00.800> very<00:07:01.070> basic<00:07:01.340> one<00:07:01.700> I

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
hand though this is a very basic one I

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.909 
hand though this is a very basic one I
know<00:07:01.970> everyone<00:07:02.360> uses<00:07:02.720> but<00:07:02.900> so<00:07:03.650> it's<00:07:03.800> very

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
know everyone uses but so it's very

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.159 
know everyone uses but so it's very
effective<00:07:04.190> basically<00:07:05.090> people<00:07:05.630> see<00:07:05.960> it<00:07:06.050> in<00:07:06.110> the

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
effective basically people see it in the

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.540 
effective basically people see it in the
thing<00:07:06.320> oh<00:07:06.440> that's<00:07:06.620> really<00:07:06.770> cool<00:07:06.890> they'll<00:07:07.370> walk

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
thing oh that's really cool they'll walk

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.640 
thing oh that's really cool they'll walk
into<00:07:07.820> it<00:07:07.910> and<00:07:08.450> then<00:07:08.750> they<00:07:08.870> can<00:07:09.110> go<00:07:09.260> out<00:07:09.320> just<00:07:09.380> by

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
into it and then they can go out just by

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.310 
into it and then they can go out just by
breaking<00:07:09.800> the<00:07:10.520> yeah<00:07:11.510> thing<00:07:11.780> underneath<00:07:12.080> but

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
breaking the yeah thing underneath but

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.630 
breaking the yeah thing underneath but
that<00:07:12.470> actually<00:07:12.680> takes<00:07:12.860> a<00:07:13.100> little<00:07:13.310> bit<00:07:13.430> of<00:07:13.490> time

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
that actually takes a little bit of time

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.460 
that actually takes a little bit of time
if<00:07:13.910> you're<00:07:14.060> not<00:07:14.090> cheating<00:07:14.660> and<00:07:14.810> they're

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
if you're not cheating and they're

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.930 
if you're not cheating and they're
probably<00:07:15.620> panic<00:07:16.040> when<00:07:16.130> I<00:07:16.220> get<00:07:16.340> in<00:07:16.460> there<00:07:16.610> when

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
probably panic when I get in there when

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.210 
probably panic when I get in there when
they<00:07:17.060> hear<00:07:17.180> the<00:07:17.360> hissing<00:07:17.510> sound<00:07:17.720> so<00:07:18.410> this<00:07:19.100> is

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
they hear the hissing sound so this is

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.790 
they hear the hissing sound so this is
how<00:07:19.340> I<00:07:19.370> like<00:07:19.550> the<00:07:19.790> I<00:07:20.120> like<00:07:21.110> to<00:07:21.260> go<00:07:21.470> underneath

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
how I like the I like to go underneath

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.420 
how I like the I like to go underneath
it<00:07:22.070> and<00:07:22.280> go<00:07:23.180> ahead<00:07:23.360> and<00:07:23.479> get<00:07:23.570> TNT<00:07:24.430> place

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
it and go ahead and get TNT place

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.290 
it and go ahead and get TNT place
underneath<00:07:25.790> and<00:07:26.360> hide<00:07:27.110> this<00:07:27.320> up<00:07:27.500> like<00:07:27.650> so<00:07:28.300> so

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300 
underneath and hide this up like so so
