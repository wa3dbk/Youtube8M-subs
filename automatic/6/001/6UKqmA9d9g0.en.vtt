00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.210
 yes you i am carolina i work in 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.250
 the editorial of the field in the house and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 would like to introduce 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 but that's the ensi live bands touch that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.750
 daily and live and in color in one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 Painted because it me that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.750
 live band now black there but here and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.619
 I just like to wrist one man 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.279
 you can see that better 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.070
 can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 now it is very stiff and it is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 does not really fit the wrist 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 why that for a sustainability 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.020
 yes yes so must be limited 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.570
 actually and the whole I will still 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.180
 quite well done by this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.180
 silicone band here I am doing relatively well 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.800
 also feels for the left for the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 left-handed among us now that me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.170
 now one is self-employed but is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 but not anymore though the left one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.949
 left-handed among us there are just synonymous 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.450
 not working that you order the o 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.900
 can stop on left-handed again from 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 Price on the market is about 100 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.100
 euro so how do you see me as well 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.130
 with too big yes that is also in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.869
 m and xl to acquire 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.159
 and we expect already 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.159
 to optics only on 8 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.580
 we already have enough of the optics 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.920
 he said his function will be in advance 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.550
 Of course I have my fitness first 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.490
 check and yes if I exist now 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.840
 here only one button what the whole whole 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 Simple is actually because I am now 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 Here I am on mine 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.259
 standard mode we pay the clock first 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.210
 So normal standard settings 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.270
 then i can talk about vision here 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.930
 Do you have the date and then just stop 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.310
 my battery stood, so to speak 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.630
 and yes, if I go up now 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 Push this power when I am now 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.369
 already in mode my safety 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 calories burned that is containing 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.770
 the function of the fitness tracker 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.270
 49 calories wonderful and I still want 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.690
 over the route I ran 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.620
 I'm going back to the steps 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.350
 I ran that first to the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.989
 tracking function so you like to jog 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.720
 you can walk or walk , however you can 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.920
 here too it is a whole 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.049
 good function for those who 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.709
 press on it there the first time a countdown 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.390
 off and then with stop in the number targeted 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.860
 how long have I been running and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.910
 then they come after that 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 after bells look and he himself 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.880
 friend how successful one was at each one 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.480
 event really well and what makes it so 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.040
 a function is sorry 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.690
 Whole in the device is of course with 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.160
 Of course, ours can be with one 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.010
 bluetooth device that was for ours 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.019
 be connected and suitable for mobile phone 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.910
 actually this music function here 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.660
 ok if i play here now 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.019
 should actually press that with mine 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:18.269
 be connected to a mobile phone that is one 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:23.910
 Of course I can record beautiful music 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:26.850
 fabric if that annoys me and exactly when 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.190
 I now again go on as in 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.239
 paint radio or no idea can 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.600
 here, of course, the volume 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.019
 adjust less loud 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.090
 I think that's what you can do 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.300
 open up yourself 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.940
 quite good 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.010
 It should be free of charge, though 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.510
 you look at the lg equal to team 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.220
 download this app 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.110

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.560
 Earn for all ios apple and android 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.670
 namely equipment itself on it press 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.350
 say all about this live band 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.860
 transferred to my phone so that itself 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.680
 So all the information has been bundled 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.760
 my activities are super much like you 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.750
 Looks 7 40 Calories I'm very proud of 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.130
 I then workout definitely stop 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.109
 all information actually yes 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.419
 already explained on the ice are 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.919
 here then sometimes included with it must 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.989
 you're just a little bit through them 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.989
 what then release there are 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
 So I could only conclude 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.280
 relaxed and I'm like this 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.570
 tested different situation 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.640
 So in everyday life as well as in sports and in the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.040
 Everyday it's real enrichment say 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.740
 I now with an app on his 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.970
 can enter goals and so will 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.850
 then just stop on the live band 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.610
 transfer and that motivates one too 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.430
 with sayings like movie or something else 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.870
 and sport continues to pursue other goals too 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.120
 You can also reach via app 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.470
 has set and in sports it is too 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.060
 Relatively yes were always practical 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.750
 Do not even get his cell phone out 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.340
 but you had his music quieter 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.610
 want to make louder or another 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.230
 want to hear other titles and that's why 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.790
 It is relatively convenient and you 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.330
 always do not keep his cellphone out of his 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.490
 job and the only drawback is i have 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.410
 Of course, it holds the optics there 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.780
 could think of something better 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.740
 I really let that band too 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.270
 fits the wrist and it is 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.480
 just does not look so funny 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.330
 three of my wife, it's just one more yes 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.490
 he takes care what you look like and 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.060
 that of course not optimal 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.420
 so that was the door with me and makes it 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.640
 Well 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.640
 and that's why it 's relaxed
