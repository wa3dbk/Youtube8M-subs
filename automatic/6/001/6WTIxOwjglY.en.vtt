00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.030
 the same as before 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.900
 how is it blooming in a place like 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.900
 this because you do not answer me 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.760
 so you're going to ignore me too 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.420
 I care no one here will notice 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.420
 awareness 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.000
 no no 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.450

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.450
 in the life 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.820
 but if you stay a little longer in this 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.510
 world maybe you discover something valuable in 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.510
 the same as how you discovered this flower 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.250
 how is it that I discovered you here in a 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.250
 night like this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.530
 It's time to go 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.579
 to die that gray day that touched me 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.399
 share tears of blood spilled 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.009
 I look at you my heart from the face of the military 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.229
 when I have nothing to say if the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.899
 words the aaiÃºn forgetfulness would mark it in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 my body I do not know if my soul is in the 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.369
 firmament when I feel it in studies 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.689

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.990

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.299
 side but thanks for everything that I have 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.060
 given if God allows it I will be at your 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.490
 prime side as a soldier looks still 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.980
 echoes do not appear and death will be 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.950

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.440
 maximum reproduce we die at the edge of the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.600
 abyss came by not apologizing to the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.939
 the sale we face the contest that 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.189
 flame life masochism caresses promises 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.200
 no bank wounds so we grow in a 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.299
 world of contradictions emotions is 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.340
 they hurt to climb rungs the cold and 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.439
 on the titanium cardboard pen and 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.870
 teaching will be taken care of when the 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.819
 years we reproduce but if he lost the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.919
 silent sentences in silence 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.870
 poisons gangrene the soul is empty 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.419
 and the fridge is not full, you have your 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.609
 beautiful things but you're worth the 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.159
 strength to endure a torture I could 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.719
 cure the pain in the radio I saw my cure of 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.909
 peter listen in writing 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.620
 fighting the censorship beginning of this 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.629
 link for then culture situation 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.030
 complex when life is myth left 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.489
 enough was assured when I gave birth to my old 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.290
 you saw the immortality clear how sad 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.569
 when the world reminds you and repeat what 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.669
 what did you say you just heard in the 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.409
 freedom with you what is the use of waiting 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.629
 when everything is relative 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.540
 the lady death without resting alive 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.450
 dark and macabre like negative photo 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.099
 I arrived I want to sing and that 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.140
 song and this I drag that I lived 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.750
 memories for me but they settle 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.209
 first dark tears eternal angel 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.489
 sleeping pills inert body with delivery 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.989
 of death beating on the chest begging 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.970
 God that wakes up without being 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.829
 disintegrates I am happy anyway 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.140
 energy never dies only it 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.849
 Transforms the way I feel about 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.859
 make songs because he wants to continue 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.450
 I live from that in their hearts because that 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.670
 mortal body although he asks the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.189
 reasons to prove your poison by being in 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.260
 both positions before I leave you a life 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.329
 written on papers and a video of 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.920
 advice in my notebook a life for 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.079
 order you remember with these cruel 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.569
 that because you will not stop turning the 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.150
 planet live while you can said a 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.909
 great poet but do not stop thinking about the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.040
 future because I live every day as the 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.500
 last and last day I want to have 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.959
 for sure that moment that you and I 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.759
 we knew the lights and shadows in which 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.889
 we are discussing we can only say thank you 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.500
 if some day not dismissed it says that 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.990
 old saying that to die we were born to 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.560
 die in this blond world 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.289
 fast you have to be deadly to 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.780
 Surviving this life resembles a 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.460
 Microfilm matters is life so long 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.620
 to breathe in you minute the time 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.810
 when he gave himself to call life is 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.360
 unhappy is very happy and it impacts the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.069
 generosity is not given only the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.080
 time is the one that makes wrinkles the 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.300
 spirit the veins wither when 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.400
 you visit the coffin feel the light of 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.349
 eternal punishment condemns the breath of the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.210
 death like the blood in the veins the 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.639
 life is naked in the presence of 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.129
 death death comes alone does not arrive by 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:07.800
 luck no longer arrives by chance 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:07.800
 I do not know which street 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:16.050
 born to die day
