00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.480
 that is, the legs itself 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.030
 and pens are 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.700
 dir 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.730
 usually by two points how to manage it 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.580
 for example, but for that I 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.790
 not a professional really in this but i 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.340
 saw mitin aktobe how it's all done 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.610
 that is, twist the spoon 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.970
 such is possible 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.970
