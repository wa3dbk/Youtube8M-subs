00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
above the board the whole time you took

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.830 
above the board the whole time you took
your<00:01:54.579> back<00:01:54.729> foot<00:01:54.969> off<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.329> then<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.509> landed

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
your back foot off and then you landed

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.020 
your back foot off and then you landed
with<00:01:55.869> your<00:01:56.079> front<00:01:56.259> foot<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.740> was<00:01:57.030> beautiful

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
with your front foot that was beautiful

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.840 
with your front foot that was beautiful
that's<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.289> step<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.649> need<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.890> do<00:02:00.069> again<00:02:00.670> and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
that's the step you need to do again and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.130 
that's the step you need to do again and
again<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.179> again<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.539> again<00:02:01.749> and<00:02:01.929> again

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
again and again and again and again

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.489 
again and again and again and again
because<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.740> one<00:02:02.950> look<00:02:03.189> at<00:02:03.340> how<00:02:03.460> far<00:02:03.939> away

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
because that one look at how far away

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.410 
because that one look at how far away
your<00:02:05.499> front<00:02:05.799> foot<00:02:05.890> was<00:02:06.249> it<00:02:06.579> flicked<00:02:07.060> down

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
your front foot was it flicked down

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.240 
your front foot was it flicked down
straight<00:02:07.929> down<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.380> ground<00:02:08.560> here<00:02:09.009> watch

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
straight down to the ground here watch

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.850 
straight down to the ground here watch
boom<00:02:09.700> your<00:02:10.450> foot<00:02:10.690> landed<00:02:11.050> way<00:02:11.260> before<00:02:11.740> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
boom your foot landed way before the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.260 
boom your foot landed way before the
board<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.250> that's<00:02:12.400> what<00:02:12.580> we<00:02:12.670> need<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.940> correct

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
board and that's what we need to correct

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.000 
board and that's what we need to correct
I<00:02:13.600> think<00:02:14.470> what<00:02:14.830> you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
I think what you

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.399 
I think what you
might<00:02:15.220> be<00:02:15.400> doing<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.939> trying<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.870> step<00:02:17.260> off

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
might be doing is trying to step off

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.929 
might be doing is trying to step off
with<00:02:17.560> your<00:02:17.680> back<00:02:17.920> foot<00:02:17.950> land<00:02:18.459> with<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:18.730> front

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
with your back foot land with your front

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.780 
with your back foot land with your front
foot<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.709> got<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.610> got<00:02:21.640> that

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
foot and then you got that you got that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.429 
foot and then you got that you got that
down<00:02:22.090> pretty<00:02:22.360> good<00:02:22.629> but<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.930> definitely<00:02:23.140> need

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
down pretty good but you definitely need

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.710 
down pretty good but you definitely need
to<00:02:23.500> get<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.739> down<00:02:23.860> better<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:25.090> being<00:02:25.420> able<00:02:25.629> to

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
to get it down better like being able to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.899 
to get it down better like being able to
do<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.019> every<00:02:26.290> time<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.799> then<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.549> next<00:02:27.670> one

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
do it every time and then the next one

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.369 
do it every time and then the next one
it<00:02:28.060> looks<00:02:28.299> like<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.659> might<00:02:28.870> be<00:02:28.900> trying<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
it looks like you might be trying to

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.259 
it looks like you might be trying to
step<00:02:29.680> off<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.010> your<00:02:30.189> front<00:02:30.430> foot<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.970> land

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
step off with your front foot and land

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.110 
step off with your front foot and land
with<00:02:31.450> your<00:02:31.599> back<00:02:31.810> foot<00:02:32.010> not<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> bad<00:02:33.340> idea<00:02:33.370> as

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
with your back foot not a bad idea as

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.069 
with your back foot not a bad idea as
long<00:02:34.599> as<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.739> still<00:02:36.190> continue<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.360> flip<00:02:37.870> up

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
long as you still continue to flip up

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.069 
long as you still continue to flip up
and<00:02:38.500> out<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.099> keep<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:40.060> first<00:02:40.480> practice

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
and out and keep that first practice

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.069 
and out and keep that first practice
step<00:02:41.319> of<00:02:41.500> flicking<00:02:41.739> up<00:02:42.069> in<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.690> can

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
step of flicking up in so you can

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.170 
step of flicking up in so you can
practice<00:02:44.560> stepping<00:02:45.159> off<00:02:45.310> your<00:02:45.549> front<00:02:45.790> foot<00:02:45.879> as

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
practice stepping off your front foot as

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.020 
practice stepping off your front foot as
long<00:02:46.420> as<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:47.260> still<00:02:47.590> flick<00:02:48.069> up<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> board

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
long as you still flick up on the board

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.440 
long as you still flick up on the board
that<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.739> vitally<00:02:51.700> important<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.239> don't

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
that is so vitally important I don't

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.740 
that is so vitally important I don't
even<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.959> where<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.409> begin<00:02:53.920> well<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:55.150> guess<00:02:55.510> I

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
even know where to begin well I guess I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.080 
even know where to begin well I guess I
already<00:02:56.019> did<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.470> did<00:02:56.739> begin<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.099> told<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.730> there

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
already did I did begin I told you there

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.879 
already did I did begin I told you there
we<00:02:58.269> go<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.690> kind<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.959> sorted<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.379> out<00:02:59.409> good

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
we go we kind of sorted that out good

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.240 
we go we kind of sorted that out good
I'm<00:03:00.069> glad<00:03:00.190> cool<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.359> actually<00:03:01.900> as<00:03:02.250> I'm

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
I'm glad cool so actually as I'm

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.309 
I'm glad cool so actually as I'm
watching<00:03:03.430> your<00:03:03.700> kickflip<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.299> closest<00:03:05.079> ones

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
watching your kickflip the closest ones

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.680 
watching your kickflip the closest ones
were<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.680> first<00:03:05.920> two<00:03:06.129> attempts<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.389> right

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
were the first two attempts so right

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.720 
were the first two attempts so right
after<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.139> are<00:03:08.260> practicing<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:09.040> drag<00:03:09.549> of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
after you are practicing that drag of

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.640 
after you are practicing that drag of
the<00:03:09.760> front<00:03:10.120> foot<00:03:10.299> then<00:03:10.659> you<00:03:10.840> flip<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.409> board

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the front foot then you flip the board

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.349 
the front foot then you flip the board
stepped<00:03:12.310> off<00:03:12.459> with<00:03:12.609> your<00:03:12.730> back<00:03:12.909> foot<00:03:12.940> your

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
stepped off with your back foot your

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.970 
stepped off with your back foot your
board<00:03:13.599> flipped<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.139> your<00:03:14.290> front<00:03:14.500> foot<00:03:14.620> was<00:03:14.859> on

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
board flipped and your front foot was on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.190 
board flipped and your front foot was on
there<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.879> need<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.209> just<00:03:16.269> continuing

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
there you need to just continuing

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.319 
there you need to just continuing
continue<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.489> practice<00:03:18.970> step<00:03:19.150> until

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
continue to do that practice step until

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.740 
continue to do that practice step until
you're<00:03:19.629> super<00:03:20.260> good<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.919> i<00:03:21.160> would<00:03:21.849> say<00:03:22.090> land

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
you're super good at it i would say land

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.589 
you're super good at it i would say land
that<00:03:23.139> practice<00:03:23.680> step<00:03:23.859> 10<00:03:24.220> times<00:03:24.609> in<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:24.970> row<00:03:25.209> and

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
that practice step 10 times in a row and

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.439 
that practice step 10 times in a row and
do<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.530> every<00:03:27.250> day<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.269> you're

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
do that every day and then you're

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.030 
do that every day and then you're
probably<00:03:28.599> going<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.959> get<00:03:29.109> good<00:03:29.500> enough<00:03:29.650> at

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
probably going to get good enough at

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.369 
probably going to get good enough at
that<00:03:30.069> where<00:03:30.639> you<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.030> flip<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.750> over<00:03:32.049> and

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
that where you can just flip it over and

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.129 
that where you can just flip it over and
just<00:03:33.310> bend<00:03:33.760> your<00:03:34.030> back<00:03:34.239> knee<00:03:34.269> up<00:03:34.750> into<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.109> air

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
just bend your back knee up into the air

that I think you can do it I think it's

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.479

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
a great idea so continue that first

a great idea so continue that first
practice<00:03:48.970> step<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.449> think<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.199> may<00:03:50.410> have
