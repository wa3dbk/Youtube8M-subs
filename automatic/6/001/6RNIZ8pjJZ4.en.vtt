 The strange laker and this video is for you. 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.290
 an invitation to make you actually 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 a subpoena 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.929
 I'd like to make a subpoena for 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.000
 you this video and the subpoena is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.100
 hands-on 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 to carry out its decisions 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.310
 What were the decisions you've already made? 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 up to here in your life that you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 made small decisions and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 great decisions when 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 stops to take action of what people 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 does 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.750
 and for us to have perception of it is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 I need people to understand that between taking 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.079
 make a decision decide to do 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 something and doing something there is a great 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.070
 bridge 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 I decided to do it definitely is not to do 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 is an important milestone one of them decides 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.110
 to do one thing now to do is what to do 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.670
 the difference and how often we do not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.010
 put your hand in the dough 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.340
 how many times we will not hand the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.830
 work how many times do we decide to do 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.110
 something at the time of executing 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 there is a power outage that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 makes it impossible for us to do what the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 people made a decision about things 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.850
 of the people we are has the audacity to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.880
 decide to do but lose all this 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.150
 daring to take action in the hands of the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 mass and actually perform what is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.570
 your strength of execution in what you 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.090
 makes the decision to make any of your 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.400
 level of execution force for this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.320
 It is a very important thing that people 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 What is your level of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 commitment to their decisions to the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.159
 He decided to do a training about I 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 I decided to make the treatment x ready you 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.479
 go there to invest in a course that does 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.450
 when you plan to put the plan in 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.259
 and work there and make a living. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.899
 in the mass 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.259
 you happen any other things or 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.750
 you create any other type of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.340
 environment so as not to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 You will see television, you will leave. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.030
 Are you going to eat? Will you see whatsapp? 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.380
 Are you going to do anything like? 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.390
 things in the brain start to invent 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.569
 very start to have a machine of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.140
 you do not perform what you 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.930
 You've decided how many times it happens. 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.060
 in our life since small decisions 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.430
 have great decisions 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 We do not put our hands in the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.640
 this video can make an invitation and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.140
 put your hand in the dough goes there in japan 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 she put her hand in the dough 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.640
 she felt pain develop skill 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.890
 you put your projects into practice 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.860
 for you to execute the projects that you 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.600
 always dreamed in your life what you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.390
 always dreamed in your life that you already 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.340
 decided to do as many things as you have decided 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.450
 do and stopped at the time to put your hand 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.790
 in the mass 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.350
 How many things do you have on your list? 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.840
 pending step you put your hand in the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.550
 and has a lot of thing that the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.350
 people put on the head preventing 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.300
 really put your hand in the dough 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.550
 Why were you so used to it? 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.650
 make the decision and is being used in 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.489
 time to put your hands in the dough and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.200
 go ahead and perform one of the things 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.450
 more results in my power of 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.780
 put things into practice 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.340
 It's something that is not me 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.380
 I say this is something that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.489
 people are born ready this is a training 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.739
 brain 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.079
 This is an action training. We train. 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.030
 our actions have to train the new 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.640
 taken as a day of action as well as 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.200
 I made a decision 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.180
 recently video about this on the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.040
 I'll leave the hammer 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.820
 him here in the description of himself 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.170
 video and how many times do we take time 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.120
 to decide 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.280
 in the time that the training much to take 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.049
 a decision and when we decide 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.049
 here comes the part of putting your hand in the dough 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.329
 we just go on aaa and leave 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.950
 this power of decision-making when 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.350
 I decided to do something with a motor of 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.760
 fact is not much energy of the thing 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.519
 how many times do we allow this 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.739
 be dissipated or broken 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.120
 be lost at the time of really 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.450
 put your hand in the dough 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.220
 so once again I speak between deciding 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.560
 do and do 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.079
 there is a great bridge in 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.540
 develop ability in 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.510
 bridge and reach our 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.480
 power of decision our power of action 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.150
 decision with action is what makes the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.800
 your win is what makes us win 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.380
 makes a three extraordinary results 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.810
 in everything in our life be our 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.220
 our business how many things are 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.860
 Can you be with you already decided? 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.390
 doing good training and already 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.240
 decided to make this treatment any 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.550
 beach did not make another sector productive 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.900
 may exist that you do not face 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.510
 Sometimes years pass, years pass. 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.040
 whole life and the person looks back and 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.070
 did not 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.240
 So it's this invitation that video can 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.830
 make this invitation and this summons 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.060
 strengthens your brain when it comes to 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.820
 put your hand in the dough 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.190
 put your hand in the dough to make a mistake 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.140
 wrong that we learn is to make a 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.180
 wrong thing we learn change 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.430
 How many times am I my day or the day? 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.260
 my life but there was no day when the 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.150
 mistakes are happening to things 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.340
 align themselves with how many and how many 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.440
 campaigns with parents that do not work for 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.400
 find work 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.140
 everything is like this, everything works and people 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.510
 really need to develop this 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.790
 ability every day plus this skill 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.550
