also has beautiful parks schools and its

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.780 
also has beautiful parks schools and its
own<00:03:35.160> solar<00:03:35.430> plant<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> roof<00:03:37.430> ok<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.730> looks

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
own solar plant on the roof ok it looks

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.250 
own solar plant on the roof ok it looks
like<00:03:39.060> my<00:03:39.180> fusion<00:03:39.510> power<00:03:39.660> research<00:03:40.080> is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
like my fusion power research is

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.560 
like my fusion power research is
complete<00:03:40.850> high-tech<00:03:41.850> buildings<00:03:42.210> require<00:03:42.360> a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
complete high-tech buildings require a

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.300 
complete high-tech buildings require a
lot<00:03:42.840> more<00:03:42.870> power<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:43.980> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> add<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
lot more power so I'm going to add a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.670 
lot more power so I'm going to add a
fusion<00:03:44.670> power<00:03:44.850> plant<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.420> city<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.650> a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
fusion power plant to the city this is a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530 
fusion power plant to the city this is a
non-polluting<00:03:47.220> power<00:03:47.550> plant<00:03:47.940> which<00:03:48.180> outputs

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
non-polluting power plant which outputs

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.690 
non-polluting power plant which outputs
a<00:03:48.600> large<00:03:48.810> amount<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.140> electricity<00:03:49.520> i'll<00:03:50.520> have

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
a large amount of electricity i'll have

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.920 
a large amount of electricity i'll have
more<00:03:50.880> than<00:03:51.030> enough<00:03:51.090> electricity<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.840> power

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
more than enough electricity to power

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.290 
more than enough electricity to power
the<00:03:52.319> city<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.250> excess<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.790> be<00:03:53.880> sold<00:03:54.120> to

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
the city and the excess can be sold to

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.900 
the city and the excess can be sold to
other<00:03:54.330> cities<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:54.990> region<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:56.400> first<00:03:56.670> i

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
other cities in the region but first i

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.210 
other cities in the region but first i
have<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.120> ignite<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> fusion<00:03:57.900> power<00:03:58.050> plant<00:03:58.410> it

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
have to ignite the fusion power plant it

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.710 
have to ignite the fusion power plant it
takes<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.490> lot<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.670> energy<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.150> start<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.420> fusion

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
takes a lot of energy to start a fusion

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.900 
takes a lot of energy to start a fusion
reaction<00:04:01.020> so<00:04:01.740> in<00:04:01.830> order<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.100> jumpstart<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.790> I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
reaction so in order to jumpstart it I

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.960 
reaction so in order to jumpstart it I
built<00:04:03.210> it<00:04:03.330> near<00:04:03.480> my<00:04:03.569> oil<00:04:03.780> power<00:04:04.050> plant<00:04:04.970> this

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
built it near my oil power plant this

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.460 
built it near my oil power plant this
will<00:04:06.150> cause<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.330> temporary<00:04:06.600> disruption<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
will cause a temporary disruption in the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.500 
will cause a temporary disruption in the
power<00:04:07.680> flow<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.550> it's<00:04:08.700> worth<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.030> once<00:04:09.300> i<00:04:09.390> get

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
power flow but it's worth it once i get

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.380 
power flow but it's worth it once i get
an<00:04:09.600> endless<00:04:09.840> supply<00:04:09.960> of<00:04:10.170> clean<00:04:10.440> power<00:04:10.710> as<00:04:11.390> you

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
an endless supply of clean power as you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.910 
an endless supply of clean power as you
can<00:04:12.480> see<00:04:12.690> all<00:04:12.930> three<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.290> my<00:04:13.440> cities<00:04:13.740> work

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
can see all three of my cities work

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.620 
can see all three of my cities work
together<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.459> make<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.700> region<00:04:15.030> successful
