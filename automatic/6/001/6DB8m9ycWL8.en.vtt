00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the other side of the straw so they

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.490 
the other side of the straw so they
don't<00:01:34.409> fall<00:01:34.619> off<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
don't fall off and then you put it on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.359 
don't fall off and then you put it on
the<00:01:37.710> inside<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.250> they

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the inside like right there so so they

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.120 
the inside like right there so so they
don't<00:01:41.579> move<00:01:42.150> over<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.960> asked<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.649> happens<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
don't move over I asked what happens to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
don't move over I asked what happens to
the<00:01:44.250> car<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> lifesaver<00:01:45.240> wheels<00:01:45.570> slide

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170

avianna<00:01:51.869> told<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.350> his<00:01:52.649> car<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.130> inspired<00:01:53.579> by

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
avianna told me his car was inspired by

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
avianna told me his car was inspired by
the<00:01:53.850> scientific<00:01:54.570> concept<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.229> real<00:01:55.470> world

the scientific concept of real world

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
the scientific concept of real world
observation<00:01:56.670> first<00:01:57.149> I'll<00:01:57.479> put<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.899> wheels<00:01:58.140> on

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
observation first I'll put the wheels on

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.469 
observation first I'll put the wheels on
his<00:01:58.619> straw<00:01:59.000> then

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
his straw then

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.529 
his straw then
put<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.110> life<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:02.070> real<00:02:02.310> cars<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
put it I do life I see real cars and

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.260 
put it I do life I see real cars and
then<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.899> coffee<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.380> call<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.039> car<00:02:05.310> made<00:02:06.030> the
