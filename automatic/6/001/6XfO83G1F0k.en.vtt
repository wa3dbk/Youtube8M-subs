00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
galaxy s 3 and the Galaxy Note 2 first

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
galaxy s 3 and the Galaxy Note 2 first
we<00:00:24.960> got<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> ask<00:00:25.260> ourselves<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
we got to ask ourselves what is the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.060 
we got to ask ourselves what is the
galaxy<00:00:27.150> note<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.900> basically<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.529> high-end

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
galaxy note it's basically a high-end

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.279 
galaxy note it's basically a high-end
smartphone<00:00:29.640> combined<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> tablet<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
smartphone combined with a tablet and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.889 
smartphone combined with a tablet and
also<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> digital<00:00:32.759> notebook<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.750> it's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
also a digital notebook so it's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
also a digital notebook so it's
basically<00:00:34.110> three<00:00:34.680> devices<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.540> what

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
basically three devices in one so what

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.240 
basically three devices in one so what
can<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.960> expect<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> Galaxy<00:00:38.010> Note<00:00:38.040> 2

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
can we expect from the Galaxy Note 2

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310 
can we expect from the Galaxy Note 2
well<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.239> safe<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> assume<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.989> will<00:00:40.140> have

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
well it's safe to assume it will have

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
well it's safe to assume it will have
similar<00:00:40.739> hardware<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.399> design<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.030> the

of the device giving you a lot more

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
of the device giving you a lot more
precision<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.799> functionality<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
precision and functionality if you

precision and functionality if you
choose<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.670> use<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:34.200> also<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> lot<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
choose to use it you also get a lot of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.740 
choose to use it you also get a lot of
apps<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.549> advantage<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> notes

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
apps that take advantage of the notes

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.800 
apps that take advantage of the notes
display<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> stylus<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.299> also<00:01:39.450> expecting

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
display and stylus we are also expecting

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
display and stylus we are also expecting
a<00:01:40.229> next-gen<00:01:40.950> s-pen<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.820> more

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
a next-gen s-pen that is more

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.120 
a next-gen s-pen that is more
comfortable<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.689> hold<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.350> also<00:01:43.740> has<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> lot

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
comfortable to hold and also has a lot

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.210 
comfortable to hold and also has a lot
more<00:01:44.159> features<00:01:45.530> now<00:01:46.530> let's<00:01:46.710> talk<00:01:46.799> about<00:01:46.950> some

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
more features now let's talk about some

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
more features now let's talk about some
of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> advantages<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.390> s3<00:01:49.049> well

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of the advantages of the s3 well

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
of the advantages of the s3 well
basically<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.979> smaller<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:50.970> more

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
basically it's smaller so will be more

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.700 
basically it's smaller so will be more
portable<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.079> easy<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.500> with

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
portable and will be easy to use with

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.920 
portable and will be easy to use with
one<00:01:53.189> hand

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
one hand

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.840 
one hand
so<00:01:54.740> an<00:01:54.830> advantage<00:01:55.190> would<00:01:55.280> be<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.670> will<00:01:55.760> be

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
so an advantage would be that will be

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.330 
so an advantage would be that will be
probably<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.450> easier<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.140> text<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.740> drive<00:01:57.800> at

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
probably be easier to text and drive at

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.300 
probably be easier to text and drive at
the<00:01:58.370> same<00:01:58.520> time<00:01:59.210> or<00:01:59.660> use<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.530> toilet<00:02:00.860> while

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the same time or use a toilet while

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.000 
the same time or use a toilet while
texting<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.690> s<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:03.020> will<00:02:03.050> be<00:02:03.350> slightly<00:02:03.650> more

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
texting the s we will be slightly more

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.860 
texting the s we will be slightly more
portable<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.820> will<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.060> an<00:02:05.270> extra<00:02:05.660> inch

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
portable so you will have an extra inch

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.960 
portable so you will have an extra inch
of<00:02:06.110> space<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.740> your<00:02:06.770> pockets<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:07.850> can

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
of space in your pockets so you can
