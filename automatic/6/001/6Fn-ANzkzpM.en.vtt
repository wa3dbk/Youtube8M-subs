00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
printed out of thin air because its loan

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.120

to a bank or to a government there's

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.979 
to a bank or to a government there's
interest<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.030> let's<00:03:47.540> think<00:03:47.630> about<00:03:47.840> that

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
interest so let's think about that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.830 
interest so let's think about that
logically<00:03:48.680> ok<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.790> principles<00:03:50.359> print<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
logically ok so the principles print it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.229 
logically ok so the principles print it
out<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.049> thin<00:03:51.290> air<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.680> they<00:03:52.609> gotta<00:03:52.940> pay<00:03:53.180> it

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
out of thin air but they gotta pay it

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.490 
out of thin air but they gotta pay it
back<00:03:53.420> with<00:03:53.450> interest<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:54.079> they've<00:03:54.230> got<00:03:54.260> to

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
back with interest so they've got to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.610 
back with interest so they've got to
constantly<00:03:55.040> create<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.910> more<00:03:56.600> money<00:03:56.870> so

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
constantly create the more money so

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.680 
constantly create the more money so
that's<00:03:57.799> why<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.040> takes<00:03:58.220> 13<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.820> 14<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.329> these<00:03:59.420> to

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
that's why it takes 13 to 14 of these to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.699 
that's why it takes 13 to 14 of these to
buy<00:03:59.870> one<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.590> these<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:02.180> hey<00:04:02.440> make<00:04:03.440> sure<00:04:03.470> you

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
buy one of these but hey make sure you

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.170 
buy one of these but hey make sure you
adjust<00:04:03.890> for<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.340> two<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.790> three<00:04:04.970> percent
