what<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> price<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.680> yet<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
what the price is going to be yet but I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
what the price is going to be yet but I
think<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.719> more<00:00:57.780> official<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> website

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
think it's more official to the website

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
think it's more official to the website
because<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.850> mean<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.420> credit<00:01:00.600> cards

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
because I mean you can use credit cards

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
because I mean you can use credit cards

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
off the path cash and it just seems like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.289

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it'd be more legit to me but as of right

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.730
