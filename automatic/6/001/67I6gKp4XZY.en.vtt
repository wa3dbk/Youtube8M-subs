we're<00:00:12.480> going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.660> talk<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:13.049> fall<00:00:13.349> color<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
we're going to talk about fall color and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.790 
we're going to talk about fall color and
how<00:00:14.549> fall<00:00:15.210> color<00:00:15.450> progresses<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.320> what

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
how fall color progresses and what

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.560 
how fall color progresses and what
reactions<00:00:17.520> are<00:00:17.670> happening<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> trees

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
reactions are happening in the trees

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420 
reactions are happening in the trees
that<00:00:19.080> create<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.560> beautiful<00:00:20.039> spectacle

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that create this beautiful spectacle

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.140 
that create this beautiful spectacle
over<00:00:21.650> a<00:00:22.650> million<00:00:23.039> people<00:00:23.430> come<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.029> the

over a million people come to the
mountains<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.810> these<00:00:24.990> beautiful<00:00:25.380> fall

mountains to see these beautiful fall
colors<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> story<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.269> starts<00:00:27.869> in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
colors but the story really starts in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.349 
colors but the story really starts in
September<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:29.130> September<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> leaves<00:00:30.119> are

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
September in September the leaves are

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.790 
September in September the leaves are
still<00:00:30.510> producing<00:00:31.019> chlorophyll<00:00:31.560> from

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
still producing chlorophyll from

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
still producing chlorophyll from
photosynthesis<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.210> once<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.660> process

photosynthesis and once that process

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.900 
photosynthesis and once that process
stops<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> leaves<00:00:35.130> start<00:00:35.460> breaking<00:00:35.880> down

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
stops and the leaves start breaking down

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
stops and the leaves start breaking down
that's<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> start<00:00:37.260> getting<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> other

that's when you start getting the other

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.100 
that's when you start getting the other
colors<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.399> within<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> leaves

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
questions I'm asked in October is when

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.130 
questions I'm asked in October is when
will<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> peak<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.280> how<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.570> tell<00:01:12.810> if

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
will the peak be and how can we tell if

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
will the peak be and how can we tell if
it's<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.860> year<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's going to be a good year and the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
it's going to be a good year and the
best<00:01:15.540> answer<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.799> looking<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.520> what

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
best answer to that is looking at what

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
best answer to that is looking at what
happens<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.180> September<00:01:18.750> weather<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
happens in September weather is really a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.789 
happens in September weather is really a
factor<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.700> fall<00:01:20.909> color<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.960> more<00:01:22.140> sunny<00:01:22.470> cool

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
factor in fall color the more sunny cool

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.560 
factor in fall color the more sunny cool
days<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> end<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> September

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
days we have at the end of September

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
days we have at the end of September
more<00:01:25.140> likely<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.680> reds<00:01:25.920> we're<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
more likely the more reds we're going to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.999 
more likely the more reds we're going to
have<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.640> trees<00:01:27.500> anthocyanins<00:01:28.500> creating

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
have more trees anthocyanins creating

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.310 
have more trees anthocyanins creating
those<00:01:29.130> trees<00:01:29.490> based<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.869> sunlight

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
those trees based on the more sunlight

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.499 
those trees based on the more sunlight
that<00:01:31.560> they're<00:01:31.860> exposed<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.270> really

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that they're exposed to so that's really

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.899 
that they're exposed to so that's really
really<00:01:33.840> important<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.290> fall<00:01:34.590> color

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
really important for fall color

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
really important for fall color
especially<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.329> seeing<00:01:36.509> reds<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.020> oranges

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
