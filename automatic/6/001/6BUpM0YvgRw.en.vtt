00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.560
 Wait, I 'm waving again 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.990
 as a May agenda I do not have to 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.990
 change this shit let's think 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.869
 hello mister bee in the new video as 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.869
 this lady sheep 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.270
 today I 'm going to teach you a tutorial like 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.040
 minecraft dream Well then let's 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.450
 need any material but 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.130
 this one I'm going to use this this shit 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 not only that, this does not have it 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.260
 to use but I'm going to change it 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.390
 a damn camera 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.640
 good many 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.329
 on the adventure map I made of 'the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.150
 walking dead 'you had to dream and good 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.510
 we have to put it to the first step 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.250
 we put three blocks 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.640
 another three blocks later who 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.150
 seek to put a middle 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.340
 So here we have to 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.740
 cover everything 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.230
 everything everything alike what is the code 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.080
 of this thing 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.720
 when the bed and then touch 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.170
 sleep 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 not appear there right there but if 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.570
 I put this here 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.710
 I will appear also up there but 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 if I put a block here 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.119
 and this and this from here does not stop anymore 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.720
 no block 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.930
 so if we sleep we will appear 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.330
 right here 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.190
 and well let's wait for it to be done 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.310
 night meanwhile I'm going to 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.760
 I'm going to teach you another tutorial 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 know the good new bucket many already 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.770
 they will ask but in case I'm going 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.130
 to show if it's still coming out 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.159
 by the way 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.070
 and I got 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.970
 if it always comes out 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.840
 I still get it 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.840
 perfect because that's how it's done 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.700
 and because this is a world the song of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.430
 gona line christmas I do not know if I know him 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.450
 I do not know if you know him but this song I 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.290
 I did not invent it 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.290
 do not stay with online use of one 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.769
 and well let's give it I was wrong in 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.769
 some parts but good 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:43.440
 and we are just in the world and 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.819
 also these debon online that infinite 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.510
 it never goes away 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.040
 if I speak a little weird it's about finishing 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.200
 because in the software video I'm ugly 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.470
 that we want 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.800
 every year of the year that you can enter the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.800
 pimp 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.850
 but good 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.180
 here are the games of hunger ' seemed 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.110

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.079
 next to me 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.329
 I also remember when I did it with my 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.329
 friends but I miss them all 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:43.020
 well come on let's see if this is not 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.020
 good good good good 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.220
 is still going 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.580
 l 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.210
 good 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.860
 and I already made the pig race from the 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.850
 a friend's house that is called but yes 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.840
 123 this is also an online one that does not 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.840
 you can pass look 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.660
 but only in this way 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.270
 and it did not work out is this way of entering 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.650
 jumping and there is a diamond sword to 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.650
 see if there can be 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.680
 well we were already doing skins 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.800
 A friend did not finish it because I was going to 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.800
 to go 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.210
 and we are going to hunt and it will go to me because 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.010
 we always leave every Tuesday or 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.570
 Wednesday I do not remember what you say 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.500
 I do not confuse with these names because 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.500
 Tuesday Wednesday 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.630

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.260
 today yes 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.570
 Minister 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:55.330
 Well, let's do something, let's go 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.410
 to leave without saving because in this world 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.560
 I do not keep 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.600
 let's look for a world that is night 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.070
 that if I remember in a world like that I already 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.820
 I remembered a world that I know always 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.820
 it is night 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.550
 If I find it clear, good 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.620
 guys, I'm not going to talk anymore because 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.620
 I'll search until later 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:50.040
 and then since after a thousand attempts 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:52.790
 the tutorial is this but what are we going 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.790
 do 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.080
 and because 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.800
 we're already finished I think so yes 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.210

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:38.569
 a totally different place but not 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:40.249
 we're next to this good thing and it's 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.120
 that the tutorial is on a map of 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.080
 adventure 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.080
