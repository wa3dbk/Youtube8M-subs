a<00:01:22.409> sustainable<00:01:22.830> resource<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.060> also

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
a sustainable resource but it's also

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
a sustainable resource but it's also
naturally<00:01:24.869> an<00:01:24.930> antibacterial<00:01:25.280> things<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.460> in

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
naturally an antibacterial things get in

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
naturally an antibacterial things get in
there<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> enzymes<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> wood<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.650> kill

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
there the enzymes in the wood and kill

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
there the enzymes in the wood and kill
the<00:01:28.979> bacteria<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.360> safer<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the bacteria so it's a much safer and
