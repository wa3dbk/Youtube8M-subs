00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.740 

the<00:00:12.380> first<00:00:12.620> chord<00:00:12.980> is<00:00:13.280> I<00:00:13.580> think<00:00:14.000> it's<00:00:14.150> a<00:00:14.240> G<00:00:14.510> at

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
the first chord is I think it's a G at

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.730 
the first chord is I think it's a G at
nine<00:00:15.050> it's<00:00:15.800> like<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.010> G<00:00:16.400> bar<00:00:17.230> or<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:18.439> think<00:00:18.590> you

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
nine it's like a G bar or you think you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.550 
nine it's like a G bar or you think you
only<00:00:19.160> strings<00:00:19.820> you're<00:00:19.939> playing<00:00:20.150> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.110 

six<00:00:23.310> five<00:00:23.550> four<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.880> three

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:42.869 

and<00:00:27.450> the<00:00:27.930> picking<00:00:28.380> Adonis's

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.420 

and<00:00:43.879> that's<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.180> intro<00:00:44.510> she<00:00:45.290> was<00:00:45.379> no<00:00:46.989> I<00:00:48.430> think

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
and that's the intro she was no I think

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.040 
and that's the intro she was no I think
he<00:00:49.579> could<00:00:49.730> straight<00:00:49.940> into<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.180> chorus<00:00:50.690> Robin

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
he could straight into a chorus Robin

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.819 
he could straight into a chorus Robin
this<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:53.000> first<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> chorus<00:00:53.899> chorus<00:00:54.470> is<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
this so first of a chorus chorus is the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.430 
this so first of a chorus chorus is the
same

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.560 

Sam<00:01:00.440> Corrigan<00:01:00.980> how<00:01:01.970> many<00:01:02.150> players<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.540> think

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
Sam Corrigan how many players I think

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.250 
Sam Corrigan how many players I think
it's<00:01:02.810> a<00:01:02.840> D<00:01:03.050> major<00:01:03.350> I<00:01:07.720> might<00:01:08.720> want<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.960> play<00:01:09.050> for

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
it's a D major I might want to play for

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:20.380 
it's a D major I might want to play for
that<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:10.040> first<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.490> second<00:01:10.820> strings

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.100 

down<00:01:21.390> over<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:23.100> first<00:01:23.370> finger<00:01:23.670> down<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
down over you first finger down to the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.039 
down over you first finger down to the
third<00:01:25.320> fret

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.250 

and<00:01:31.500> back<00:01:31.740> up

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.370 

and<00:01:35.710> back<00:01:35.890> down

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.800 

and<00:01:39.890> then<00:01:40.040> play<00:01:40.420> G<00:01:41.420> again

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:52.800 

so<00:01:47.200> slowly<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.770> first<00:01:50.320> verse<00:01:51.320> was<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.680> first

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
so slowly the first verse was the first

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:14.119 
so slowly the first verse was the first
chorus<00:01:53.810> goes<00:01:53.960> like<00:01:54.140> this

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.699 

no<00:02:15.129> matter<00:02:15.519> where<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.120> roam

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
no matter where I roam

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.309 
no matter where I roam
I<00:02:19.329> will<00:02:20.329> return<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.680> my<00:02:21.799> English<00:02:22.519> role<00:02:23.319> for

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
I will return to my English role for

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:34.190 
I will return to my English role for
nobody<00:02:25.780> could<00:02:26.780> ever<00:02:27.079> tell<00:02:28.040> me

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.920 

and<00:02:35.200> then<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.440> comes<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.800> chorus<00:02:36.810> which<00:02:37.810> is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and then it comes to a chorus which is

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.839 
and then it comes to a chorus which is
for<00:02:38.080> Zhi<00:02:38.230> Shu

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.270 

the<00:02:41.420> major<00:02:42.079> 7<00:02:42.859> shape

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.970 

finger<00:02:47.180> down

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.650

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
oh gee shape again

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.730 
oh gee shape again
only<00:02:55.660> repeats<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:59.560> verse

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
only repeats that so because the verse

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.460 
only repeats that so because the verse
is<00:03:01.320> sailor<00:03:02.760> 7c

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:15.710 

the<00:03:07.280> whole<00:03:07.610> sky<00:03:10.570> but<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.600> return

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720
