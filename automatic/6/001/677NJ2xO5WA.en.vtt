we're<00:01:52.829> probably<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.640> all<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.939> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
we're probably not gonna use all of that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.100 
we're probably not gonna use all of that
so<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> only<00:01:55.200> need<00:01:56.149> again<00:01:57.149> maybe<00:01:57.390> an<00:01:57.540> ounce<00:01:57.719> or

all over everything

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.980 
all over everything
now<00:02:32.459> again<00:02:32.820> we're<00:02:33.030> gonna<00:02:33.150> wait<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> sides

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
to start cooking it's a slow process and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.630 
to start cooking it's a slow process and
all<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.150> egg<00:02:42.330> batter<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:43.760> running<00:02:44.760> underneath

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
all the egg batter is running underneath

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.400 
all the egg batter is running underneath
