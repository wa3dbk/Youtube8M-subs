00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
see if my ultimate adds on to the stasis
duration<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> happens<00:00:27.119> right<00:00:27.599> then

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
duration but as it happens right then

duration but as it happens right then
and<00:00:28.019> there<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.680> ultimate<00:00:29.070> had<00:00:29.279> zero

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and there you see my ultimate had zero

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429 
and there you see my ultimate had zero
impact<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.869> increase<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
impact and it did not increase the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
impact and it did not increase the
duration<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> stasis<00:00:32.340> effect<00:00:32.880> which<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
duration of the stasis effect which to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
duration of the stasis effect which to
me<00:00:33.719> quite<00:00:33.960> honestly<00:00:34.350> does<00:00:34.620> make<00:00:34.829> sense<00:00:35.100> we

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
me quite honestly does make sense we

by but now let's test solutions ultimate

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
by but now let's test solutions ultimate
again<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:07.890> ultimate<00:01:08.250> channeling<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
them which allows her to use her

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.889 
them which allows her to use her
ultimate<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> target<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
ultimate with that target and this is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
ultimate with that target and this is
called<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.259> oath-sworn<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:02.070> interesting

thing<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> target<00:02:03.509> she<00:02:03.659> uses<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
thing is that the target she uses this

target must be airborne even though the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.410 
target must be airborne even though the
target<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.099> airborne<00:02:51.790> which<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.180> not<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
target is airborne which is not the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.390 
target is airborne which is not the
problem<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.079> clearly<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.590> black<00:02:53.799> shield<00:02:54.099> does

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
problem so clearly the black shield does

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.370 
problem so clearly the black shield does
prevent<00:02:54.819> yasuo's<00:02:55.450> ultimate<00:02:55.930> even<00:02:56.200> if<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
prevent yasuo's ultimate even if the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.380 
prevent yasuo's ultimate even if the
target<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.829> already<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.519> air<00:02:57.819> but<00:02:58.120> what<00:02:58.269> if

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
target is already in the air but what if

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.970 
target is already in the air but what if
the<00:02:58.510> black<00:02:58.720> shield<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.079> put<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.470> target<00:02:59.709> as

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
the black shield is put on the target as

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.350 
the black shield is put on the target as
they<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.280> ready<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:00.579> use<00:03:00.700> my<00:03:00.880> ultimate<00:03:01.269> on
