00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:03.399 
alright I've talked to you a lot about

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.270 
alright I've talked to you a lot about
the<00:00:03.610> seven<00:00:04.120> diatonic<00:00:05.110> scale<00:00:05.500> patterns<00:00:06.010> and

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.280 
the seven diatonic scale patterns and

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.310 
the seven diatonic scale patterns and
how<00:00:06.520> they<00:00:06.730> relate<00:00:06.790> to<00:00:07.090> modes<00:00:07.510> and<00:00:07.780> all<00:00:07.930> that<00:00:08.109> I

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
how they relate to modes and all that I

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.780 
how they relate to modes and all that I
want<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:08.860> take<00:00:09.040> this<00:00:09.070> time<00:00:09.460> to<00:00:10.230> explore<00:00:11.230> and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
want to take this time to explore and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.400 
want to take this time to explore and
delve<00:00:12.790> into<00:00:13.030> a<00:00:13.240> little<00:00:13.630> bit<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:13.930> difference

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
delve into a little bit the difference

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.519 
delve into a little bit the difference
between<00:00:14.590> two<00:00:15.070> very<00:00:15.309> common<00:00:15.929> patterns<00:00:16.929> the

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
between two very common patterns the

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.970 
between two very common patterns the
natural<00:00:18.310> minor<00:00:18.550> or<00:00:18.849> Aeolian<00:00:19.720> pattern<00:00:20.169> and<00:00:20.380> the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
natural minor or Aeolian pattern and the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.309 
natural minor or Aeolian pattern and the
Dorian<00:00:21.519> pattern<00:00:21.909> and<00:00:22.060> they're<00:00:22.630> both<00:00:22.810> very

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:23.319 
Dorian pattern and they're both very

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.029 
Dorian pattern and they're both very
commonly<00:00:23.890> used<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:24.989> in<00:00:25.989> fact<00:00:26.349> in<00:00:26.529> lesson<00:00:26.890> 2

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
commonly used and in fact in lesson 2

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.409 
commonly used and in fact in lesson 2
i'm<00:00:27.249> going<00:00:27.279> to<00:00:27.429> show<00:00:27.579> you<00:00:27.640> how<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> Dorian

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
i'm going to show you how the Dorian

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.749 
i'm going to show you how the Dorian
pattern<00:00:28.839> is<00:00:29.019> sometimes<00:00:29.619> mixed<00:00:30.069> in<00:00:30.460> with<00:00:30.699> the

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
pattern is sometimes mixed in with the

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.569 
pattern is sometimes mixed in with the
mixolydian<00:00:31.590> pattern<00:00:32.590> or<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.920> Mixel<00:00:33.309> blues

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
mixolydian pattern or the Mixel blues

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.720 
mixolydian pattern or the Mixel blues
thing<00:00:33.910> I've<00:00:34.120> talked<00:00:34.359> to<00:00:34.510> you<00:00:34.570> about<00:00:34.690> all<00:00:34.989> right

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
there's there's always just a threat or

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.439 
there's there's always just a threat or
two<00:00:38.800> difference<00:00:39.280> between<00:00:39.670> one<00:00:39.940> pattern<00:00:40.179> and

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
two difference between one pattern and

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.660 
two difference between one pattern and
attend<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.809> next<00:00:40.949> but<00:00:41.949> for<00:00:42.250> whatever<00:00:42.429> reason

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
you know one song uses dorina the next

you know one song uses dorina the next
one<00:00:46.870> uses<00:00:47.199> natural<00:00:47.350> minor<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.219> song

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
one uses natural minor and the song

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.520 
one uses natural minor and the song
after<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:48.850> uses<00:00:49.120> Mixel<00:00:49.660> blues<00:00:49.929> but<00:00:50.230> it's<00:00:50.379> got

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
after that uses Mixel blues but it's got

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.250 
after that uses Mixel blues but it's got
a<00:00:50.559> Dorian<00:00:51.190> note<00:00:51.460> in<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.879> people<00:00:52.629> mix<00:00:53.050> and

a Dorian note in and people mix and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.259 
a Dorian note in and people mix and
match<00:00:53.440> things<00:00:53.829> sometimes<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.579> then<00:00:54.760> after

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.689 
hit song next thing you know everybody's
doing<00:00:58.899> it<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.320> becomes<00:00:59.440> common<00:01:00.249> practice

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
doing it and it becomes common practice

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.899 
doing it and it becomes common practice
alright<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:02.019> let's<00:01:02.440> dig<00:01:02.679> in<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:03.190> very

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
alright so let's dig in to very

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.190 
alright so let's dig in to very
specifically<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.750> difference<00:01:05.110> between

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
specifically the difference between

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.800 
specifically the difference between
natural<00:01:05.740> minor<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.490> Dorian<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.690> you

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
natural minor and Dorian because you

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.680 
natural minor and Dorian because you
will<00:01:08.020> find<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.500> useful<00:01:09.160> at<00:01:09.400> times<00:01:09.760> alright<00:01:10.510> our

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
will find it useful at times alright our

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.410 
will find it useful at times alright our
natural<00:01:11.440> minor<00:01:11.680> scale<00:01:11.830> in<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.490> key<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:15.420> b

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
natural minor scale in the key of a a b

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
natural minor scale in the key of a a b
c<00:01:16.450> d<00:01:17.170> e<00:01:17.560> half<00:01:18.310> natural<00:01:19.150> she

maybe<00:01:21.690> if<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.930> continue<00:01:22.470> I've<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.220> beam<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
maybe if I continue I've got a beam and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:35.890 
maybe if I continue I've got a beam and
I<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> reach<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.540> their<00:01:25.940> here's<00:01:26.940> my

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.850 

there's<00:01:36.900> my<00:01:37.050> natural<00:01:37.590> minor<00:01:37.830> skin

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.940 

and<00:01:41.310> there's<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.760> now<00:01:42.030> natural<00:01:42.990> note<00:01:43.230> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and there's that now natural note the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.610 
and there's that now natural note the
Dorian<00:01:44.520> scale<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> Dorian<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.410> case

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
Dorian scale the a Dorian in this case

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.500 
Dorian scale the a Dorian in this case
is<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.160> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.370> change<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:47.880> F<00:01:48.240> natural

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
is just going to change that F natural

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.260 
is just going to change that F natural
to<00:01:49.410> an<00:01:49.560> f-sharp<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.940> that's<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.240> only

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to an f-sharp and that's the only

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.360 
to an f-sharp and that's the only
difference<00:01:51.780> between<00:01:51.870> natural<00:01:52.230> minor<00:01:52.650> and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
difference between natural minor and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.440 
difference between natural minor and
Dorian<00:01:53.820> okay<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:59.490> change<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> over<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.360> we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
Dorian okay just change it over here we

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.749 
Dorian okay just change it over here we
go

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.559 

okay<00:02:07.759> now<00:02:08.450> why<00:02:09.289> do<00:02:09.349> we<00:02:09.619> want<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:10.569> well

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
okay now why do we want to do this well

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.210 
okay now why do we want to do this well
I'll<00:02:11.870> tell<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.170> there's<00:02:12.380> part<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> reason

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I'll tell you there's part of the reason

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.160 
I'll tell you there's part of the reason
is<00:02:13.340> because<00:02:13.370> when<00:02:13.970> people<00:02:14.000> play<00:02:14.480> rock<00:02:15.140> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
is because when people play rock and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.220 
is because when people play rock and
blues<00:02:15.530> music<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.430> lot<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.940> times<00:02:17.150> they<00:02:17.870> kind<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
blues music a lot of times they kind of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.690 
blues music a lot of times they kind of
cheat<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> chord<00:02:18.920> progressions<00:02:19.489> it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
cheat and chord progressions it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.910 
cheat and chord progressions it
shouldn't<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> minor<00:02:20.450> chord<00:02:20.810> what<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:21.739> end

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
shouldn't be a minor chord what they end

key of a minor but to use the D major
chord<00:02:38.150> which<00:02:38.900> happens<00:02:39.440> very<00:02:39.709> frequently<00:02:40.010> in

chord which happens very frequently in
music<00:02:40.910> okay<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.140> it's<00:02:42.410> because<00:02:42.799> that<00:02:43.010> f

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
music okay and so it's because that f
