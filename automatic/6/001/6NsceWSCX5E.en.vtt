 Good gardening is simonetta today 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.930
 I want to tell you how to use 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.939
 laurel in the kitchen how to store 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.830
 its leaves of this precious aromatic 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.830
 which is irreplaceable for different people 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.960
 culinary preparations 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.050
 I will show you how to prepare a crown 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.890
 to hang in the kitchen that will also be 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:37.629
 very decorative we need fil 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:42.729
 of iron quite often of a lit. 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:44.920
 ietta painted and of course different 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.979
 laurel thresholds 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.629
 collect fresh branches of laurel and 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.339
 remove the leaves 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.350
 if you are sure of their origin 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.570
 from a wood in your garden 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.920
 it is not necessary to wash them otherwise vi 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.120
 I recommend giving a rinse below 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.790
 the water 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 prepare with the pliers a very simple 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.630
 iron circle you made 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.350
 formed an eyelet then we must 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.490
 take the leaves and put them but 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 abnormal inside our ring and do it 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.100
 it takes a lot to scroll and you have 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.150
 also a little patience 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.180
 you can also get help from yours 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.180
 children almost becomes a game 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.620
 while among other things you will use it 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 you will feel it release and yours 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.570
 aroma bay leaf a natural antiseptic 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.060
 once it was often used also 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.810
 in books to protect from moths 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.120
 precious pages are also made of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.040
 moth bags with laurel yes 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.470
 can add to the peppercorns of 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.970
 star anise and we can put these 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.010
 little bags quietly in the closets 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.520
 see that as the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.000
 crown is taking shape 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.160
 do so with different leaves you can do 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 the largest or smallest circle but 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.100
 I advise you to do it smaller because 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.020
 however it is also easier than an excellent one 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.940
 solution to preserve it and surely 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.940
 a welcome gift also for friends 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.560
 we have exhausted all our fools and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.110
 we have practically finished ours 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:42.110
 crown at this point we have to put on 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.030
 the last part in the sla that we had 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.489
 prepared 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.260
 our crown is ready with one 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.260
 simple rope can be hung in 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.290
 cooking as a food supply for everything 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.219
 the year 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.219

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.110
