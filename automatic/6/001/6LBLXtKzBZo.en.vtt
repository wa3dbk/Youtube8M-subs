it'll<00:03:13.110> kind<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> fit<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.220> good<00:03:14.640> broad<00:03:15.299> range<00:03:15.570> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
it'll kind of fit a good broad range and

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.690 
it'll kind of fit a good broad range and
as<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> customer<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.220> specify<00:03:17.670> that

the<00:03:19.470> two<00:03:19.620> spring<00:03:19.890> type<00:03:20.100> no<00:03:20.489> no<00:03:20.820> difference<00:03:21.209> in

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the two spring type no no difference in

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.539 
the two spring type no no difference in
price<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.829> same<00:03:22.950> with<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> Ford

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
price so that's the same with the Ford

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.100 
price so that's the same with the Ford
small-block<00:03:24.060> head<00:03:24.329> as<00:03:24.480> well<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.900> both

and again no difference in price there

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.539 
and again no difference in price there
either<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.620> know<00:03:29.100> that's<00:03:29.250> certainly<00:03:29.489> a

problems there normally we on our
engines<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.260> recommend<00:03:43.680> 91<00:03:44.100> octane<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.519> good

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060
