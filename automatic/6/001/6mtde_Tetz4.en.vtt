00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:35.230 
new product and let's get going greatly
sounds<00:00:27.189> good<00:00:27.339> all<00:00:27.519> right

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.580 

Ares<00:00:36.240> 214<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.520> 14<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.330> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
Ares 214 so to 14 this is this is the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.810 
Ares 214 so to 14 this is this is the
what<00:00:41.100> loft<00:00:41.340> week<00:00:41.610> 20<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> 24<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.700> this

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
what loft week 20 this is the 24 so this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.290 
what loft week 20 this is the 24 so this
is<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.059> 1224<00:00:45.720> his<00:00:45.989> old<00:00:46.170> product<00:00:47.120> have<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> hit

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
is a 1224 his old product have you hit

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.439 
is a 1224 his old product have you hit
maybe<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.960> more<00:00:49.170> Lee

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.890 

good

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
good

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.040 
good
217<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.710> probably<00:01:03.070> average<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.700> two<00:01:04.239> 16<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.870> 15

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
217 so probably average of two 16 to 15

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.250 
217 so probably average of two 16 to 15
lookie<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.190> going<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.400> be<00:01:06.520> comparable

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
lookie this is going to be comparable

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.180 
lookie this is going to be comparable
cases<00:01:08.260> are<00:01:08.380> new<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:10.030> new<00:01:10.210> product<00:01:11.190> we're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
cases are new the new product we're

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.410 
cases are new the new product we're
going<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.370> compare<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.030> old<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.330> see

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
going to compare this to the old and see

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.410 
going to compare this to the old and see
what<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.690> distance<00:01:14.080> gained<00:01:14.320> is

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.999 

oh<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.650> hit<00:01:26.799> solid<00:01:27.040> oak<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:28.830> little<00:01:29.830> towards

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
oh and it hit solid oak a little towards

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.149 
oh and it hit solid oak a little towards
hill<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> little<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.729> still<00:01:30.970> 223<00:01:31.810> okay<00:01:32.799> sit<00:01:32.860> you

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
hill a little but still 223 okay sit you

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.820 
hill a little but still 223 okay sit you
know<00:01:38.369> pretty<00:01:39.369> solid<00:01:39.759> there<00:01:39.909> yeah<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.360> was<00:01:40.450> good

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
know pretty solid there yeah it was good

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.149 
know pretty solid there yeah it was good
so<00:01:41.830> 228<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:43.390> distance<00:01:43.930> gained<00:01:44.229> what<00:01:44.860> we<00:01:44.979> say<00:01:45.130> to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
so 228 so distance gained what we say to

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.230 
so 228 so distance gained what we say to
16<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:47.130> there's<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.220> 12<00:01:48.460> yards<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.170> plus<00:01:50.409> 12<00:01:50.770> on
