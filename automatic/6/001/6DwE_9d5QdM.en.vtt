during<00:04:43.579> this<00:04:44.529> today's<00:04:45.849> visit<00:04:46.849> I<00:04:47.149> learned<00:04:47.419> that

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689 
during this today's visit I learned that

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.779 
during this today's visit I learned that
this<00:04:48.019> was<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:49.039> British<00:04:49.759> group<00:04:50.089> who<00:04:51.019> by

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
this was the British group who by

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.949 
this was the British group who by
unfortunately<00:04:52.789> by<00:04:52.939> chance<00:04:53.269> to<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:53.779> weather

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:53.959 
unfortunately by chance to the weather

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:56.379 
unfortunately by chance to the weather
from<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.469> UK<00:04:54.769> so<00:04:54.799> they<00:04:55.309> didn't<00:04:55.729> take<00:04:55.969> it<00:04:56.179> back

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
from the UK so they didn't take it back

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.339 
from the UK so they didn't take it back
so<00:04:57.019> he<00:04:57.199> promised<00:04:57.619> this<00:04:57.799> to<00:04:58.069> me<00:04:58.779> so<00:04:59.779> let<00:05:00.319> us

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
so he promised this to me so let us

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.659 
so he promised this to me so let us
remember<00:05:00.919> that<00:05:01.189> this<00:05:01.969> exercise<00:05:02.779> is

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
remember that this exercise is

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.009 
remember that this exercise is
experimental<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:05.739> exploratory<00:05:07.089> and<00:05:08.089> do<00:05:08.809> this

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:09.019 
experimental and exploratory and do this

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:12.759 
experimental and exploratory and do this
to<00:05:09.409> our<00:05:10.189> helicopter<00:05:11.059> crews<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:12.319> will<00:05:12.559> go<00:05:12.739> on

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:12.769 
to our helicopter crews that will go on

these<00:05:41.869> are<00:05:42.439> very<00:05:42.829> complicated<00:05:43.309> things<00:05:44.119> to

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
these are very complicated things to

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.979 
these are very complicated things to

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:52.149 
overcome but the participation in this
exercise<00:05:49.360> already<00:05:50.360> shows<00:05:50.809> that<00:05:51.679> there<00:05:52.009> is

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
exercise already shows that there is

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.689 
exercise already shows that there is

00:05:59.319 --> 00:05:59.329 
the need and the agency is up to the

00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:03.850 
the need and the agency is up to the
challenge<00:06:00.939> with<00:06:01.939> an<00:06:02.119> exercise<00:06:02.779> plan<00:06:03.110> spread

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
challenge with an exercise plan spread

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.619 
challenge with an exercise plan spread
over<00:06:04.069> the<00:06:04.939> next<00:06:05.269> five<00:06:05.509> years<00:06:06.849> eda<00:06:07.849> is<00:06:08.119> sure

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
over the next five years eda is sure

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.369 
over the next five years eda is sure
that<00:06:09.379> member<00:06:09.799> states<00:06:10.219> are<00:06:10.639> ready<00:06:11.199> to<00:06:12.199> work

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379 
that member states are ready to work

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.399 
that member states are ready to work
together<00:06:12.709> to<00:06:13.509> improve<00:06:14.509> the<00:06:14.959> copter

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
together to improve the copter

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:16.390 
together to improve the copter
capability

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
capability

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.719 
capability
so<00:06:17.060> we<00:06:17.300> will<00:06:17.360> work<00:06:17.690> together<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.729> provide

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
so we will work together to provide

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.530 
so we will work together to provide
training<00:06:20.449> opportunities<00:06:21.410> to<00:06:22.190> ensure<00:06:22.580> lessons

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
training opportunities to ensure lessons

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.590 
training opportunities to ensure lessons
are<00:06:23.840> not<00:06:24.020> lost<00:06:24.290> and<00:06:24.650> to<00:06:25.580> develop<00:06:25.789> better

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
are not lost and to develop better

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.600 
are not lost and to develop better
frameworks<00:06:27.410> to<00:06:27.770> make<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.669> process<00:06:28.940> easier

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
frameworks to make the process easier

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.999 
frameworks to make the process easier
it's<00:06:31.610> worth<00:06:31.910> noting<00:06:32.750> that<00:06:33.410> the<00:06:33.830> helicopter

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
it's worth noting that the helicopter

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.700 
it's worth noting that the helicopter
training<00:06:34.729> program<00:06:35.539> is<00:06:36.259> not<00:06:36.500> the<00:06:36.680> only

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
training program is not the only

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.620 
training program is not the only
helicopter<00:06:37.580> program<00:06:38.389> in<00:06:38.720> eda<00:06:40.000> six<00:06:41.000> nations
