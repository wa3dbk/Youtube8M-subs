hi<00:00:05.710> in<00:00:06.070> this<00:00:06.130> tutorial<00:00:06.640> I'm<00:00:07.060> going<00:00:07.330> to<00:00:07.390> talk

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
hi in this tutorial I'm going to talk

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.150 
hi in this tutorial I'm going to talk
about<00:00:07.630> the<00:00:07.900> distribution<00:00:08.230> of<00:00:08.620> drugs<00:00:08.889> within

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
about the distribution of drugs within

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.060 
about the distribution of drugs within
body<00:00:09.550> compartments<00:00:10.300> in<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:11.590> previous

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
body compartments in the previous

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.039 
body compartments in the previous
tutorial<00:00:12.580> I<00:00:12.730> said<00:00:13.030> that<00:00:13.209> this<00:00:13.299> video<00:00:13.660> would<00:00:13.930> be

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
tutorial I said that this video would be

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.350 
tutorial I said that this video would be
on<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.320> metabolism<00:00:14.950> of<00:00:15.070> drugs<00:00:15.209> but<00:00:16.209> I've

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
on the metabolism of drugs but I've

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.510 
on the metabolism of drugs but I've
decided<00:00:16.960> that<00:00:17.170> it's<00:00:17.350> probably<00:00:17.680> best<00:00:17.920> to<00:00:18.310> talk

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
decided that it's probably best to talk

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.130 
decided that it's probably best to talk
about<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.910> distribution<00:00:19.270> of<00:00:19.630> drugs<00:00:19.900> before

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
about the distribution of drugs before

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.759 
about the distribution of drugs before
we<00:00:20.410> move<00:00:20.560> on<00:00:20.710> to<00:00:20.859> metabolism<00:00:22.679> for<00:00:23.679> the

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 
we move on to metabolism for the

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.249 
we move on to metabolism for the
purposes<00:00:24.250> of<00:00:24.310> distribution<00:00:25.090> we<00:00:25.689> can<00:00:25.720> consider

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
purposes of distribution we can consider

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.380 
purposes of distribution we can consider
that<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.830> body<00:00:27.039> is<00:00:27.189> made<00:00:27.400> up<00:00:27.609> of<00:00:27.759> four<00:00:28.150> major

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
that the body is made up of four major

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.480 
that the body is made up of four major
compartments<00:00:29.230> which<00:00:30.160> are<00:00:30.310> really

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
compartments which are really

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.510 
compartments which are really
collections<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.269> fluid<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:32.160> numerous<00:00:33.160> minor

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
collections of fluid and numerous minor

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.670 
collections of fluid and numerous minor
compartments

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.620 

these<00:00:40.680> major<00:00:41.010> compartments<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.360> blood

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
these major compartments are the blood

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.479 
these major compartments are the blood
or<00:00:43.560> strictly<00:00:44.070> speaking<00:00:44.310> the<00:00:44.760> plasma

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:56.560 

fat<00:00:51.820> extracellular<00:00:52.820> fluid

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.670 

and<00:00:57.100> intracellular<00:00:58.100> fluid<00:00:59.350> then<00:01:00.350> there<00:01:00.560> are

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
and intracellular fluid then there are

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.340 
and intracellular fluid then there are
numerous<00:01:00.890> other<00:01:01.309> minor<00:01:01.730> compartments<00:01:02.420> these

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
numerous other minor compartments these

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.370 
numerous other minor compartments these
include<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.860> cerebral<00:01:04.640> spinal<00:01:04.729> fluid<00:01:05.380> the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
include the cerebral spinal fluid the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.040 
include the cerebral spinal fluid the
peritoneum<00:01:07.870> synovial<00:01:08.870> fluid<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.530> joints

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
peritoneum synovial fluid and joints

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.700 
peritoneum synovial fluid and joints
and<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:12.040> fetus<00:01:12.400> in<00:01:12.550> pregnancy

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
and the fetus in pregnancy

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.770 
and the fetus in pregnancy
there<00:01:15.520> are<00:01:15.640> numerous<00:01:15.820> others<00:01:16.330> but<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.720> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
there are numerous others but for the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.530 
there are numerous others but for the
purposes<00:01:17.230> of<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.710> tutorial<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:19.180> consider

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
purposes of this tutorial we'll consider

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
purposes of this tutorial we'll consider
these<00:01:19.840> as<00:01:20.170> one<00:01:20.530> single<00:01:20.830> compartment

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 

so<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> drug<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.690> placed<00:01:25.050> into<00:01:25.410> one<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so if a drug is placed into one of the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
so if a drug is placed into one of the
compartments<00:01:25.980> we<00:01:26.550> can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> might

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
compartments we can see how it might

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
compartments we can see how it might
move<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.050> distribute<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.860> other

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
move and distribute into other

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.450 
move and distribute into other
compartments<00:01:30.560> often<00:01:31.560> drugs<00:01:31.800> are<00:01:31.950> placed<00:01:32.160> into

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
compartments often drugs are placed into

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.640 
compartments often drugs are placed into
the<00:01:32.580> blood<00:01:32.870> these<00:01:33.870> are<00:01:34.110> drugs<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the blood these are drugs which are

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.929 
the blood these are drugs which are
given<00:01:34.920> intravenously

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.910 

so<00:01:38.630> when<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.810> drug<00:01:39.049> is<00:01:39.170> placed<00:01:39.439> into<00:01:39.740> a

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so when a drug is placed into a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.980 
so when a drug is placed into a
compartment<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.729> often<00:01:41.149> associates<00:01:41.749> with

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
compartment it often associates with

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.039 
compartment it often associates with
binding<00:01:42.409> molecules<00:01:43.569> these<00:01:44.569> binding

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
binding molecules these binding

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.139 
binding molecules these binding
molecules<00:01:45.499> are<00:01:45.770> often<00:01:46.340> proteins<00:01:46.850> such<00:01:47.119> as

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
molecules are often proteins such as

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.550 
molecules are often proteins such as
albumin<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:50.060> process<00:01:50.539> sequester's<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
albumin this process sequester's the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800 
albumin this process sequester's the
drug<00:01:51.770> within<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.159> compartment<00:01:52.810> effectively

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
drug within the compartment effectively

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.690 
drug within the compartment effectively
increasing<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.649> compartment<00:01:55.100> storage

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
increasing that compartment storage

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.469 
increasing that compartment storage
capacity<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:57.490> there<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.609> an<00:01:58.759> equilibrium

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
capacity and there is an equilibrium

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.690 
capacity and there is an equilibrium
maintained<00:02:00.049> between<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:00.920> bound<00:02:01.159> drug<00:02:01.459> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
maintained between the bound drug and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.510 
maintained between the bound drug and
the<00:02:01.939> unbound<00:02:02.299> drug<00:02:02.599> the<00:02:03.500> unbound<00:02:03.920> drug<00:02:04.219> within

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
the unbound drug the unbound drug within

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.240 
the unbound drug the unbound drug within
a<00:02:04.700> compartment<00:02:05.329> is<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:06.109> able<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.469> move<00:02:06.770> into

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
a compartment is then able to move into

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.910 
a compartment is then able to move into
a<00:02:07.789> new<00:02:08.179> compartment<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.899> thus<00:02:09.709> an

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
a new compartment and thus an

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.380 
a new compartment and thus an
equilibrium<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.700> maintained<00:02:11.209> between

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
equilibrium is maintained between

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.250 
equilibrium is maintained between
adjacent<00:02:11.959> compartments<00:02:13.720> when<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> drug<00:02:15.019> moves

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
adjacent compartments when a drug moves

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.530 
adjacent compartments when a drug moves
into<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.560> new<00:02:15.739> compartment<00:02:16.310> some<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.209> drug

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
into a new compartment some of that drug

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.569 
into a new compartment some of that drug
is<00:02:17.720> sequestered<00:02:18.200> by<00:02:18.590> binding<00:02:18.950> molecules

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
is sequestered by binding molecules

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.790 
is sequestered by binding molecules
within<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.090> new<00:02:20.239> compartment

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.220 

this<00:02:24.520> process<00:02:24.970> continues<00:02:25.210> until<00:02:25.900> there<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.200> a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this process continues until there is a

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.620 
this process continues until there is a
balance<00:02:26.650> between<00:02:26.740> each<00:02:27.190> compartment<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.910> a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
balance between each compartment and a

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.150 
balance between each compartment and a
balance<00:02:28.960> between<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.350> amount<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.650> free<00:02:29.890> drug

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
balance between the amount of free drug

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
balance between the amount of free drug
versus<00:02:30.760> bound<00:02:31.150> drug<00:02:31.540> within<00:02:32.080> each

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
versus bound drug within each

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.750 
versus bound drug within each
compartment<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.950> balance<00:02:36.280> between<00:02:36.430> each

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
compartment the balance between each

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.730 
compartment the balance between each
compartment<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.480> determined<00:02:37.990> by<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> number<00:02:38.410> of

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
compartment is determined by a number of

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.890 
compartment is determined by a number of
factors<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.520> this<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.420> best<00:02:40.660> represented

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
equilibrium constants further here but I

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.510 
equilibrium constants further here but I
am<00:03:04.690> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.170> talk<00:03:05.350> about<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.740> factors<00:03:06.160> that

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
am going to talk about the factors that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.950 
am going to talk about the factors that
affect<00:03:06.850> where<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> drugs<00:03:07.420> would<00:03:07.630> prefer<00:03:07.930> to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
affect where the drugs would prefer to

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.740 
affect where the drugs would prefer to
move<00:03:08.290> into<00:03:08.620> one<00:03:08.980> compartment<00:03:09.340> versus<00:03:09.910> another

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
move into one compartment versus another

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.500 
move into one compartment versus another
thus<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.890> can<00:03:13.430> say<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.000> equilibrium

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
thus I can say that the equilibrium

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.920 
thus I can say that the equilibrium

therefore<00:05:06.570> for<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:06.960> 70<00:05:07.350> kilogram<00:05:07.500> person<00:05:08.220> I

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
therefore for a 70 kilogram person I

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.850 
therefore for a 70 kilogram person I
need<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.760> dose<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.270> 15<00:05:09.660> milligrams<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:12.860> that's

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
need a dose of 15 milligrams and that's

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.909 
need a dose of 15 milligrams and that's
