00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
start with two fingers go like that try

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.720 
start with two fingers go like that try
to<00:00:16.529> make<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> land<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.100> my<00:00:17.220> middle<00:00:17.369> finger<00:00:17.430> I'd

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
to make it land on my middle finger I'd

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519 
to make it land on my middle finger I'd
always<00:00:17.940> spin<00:00:18.240> or<00:00:18.449> whatever<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.840> mess-up<00:00:19.230> blah

always spin or whatever a mess-up blah
blah

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
blah

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.640 
blah
it'll<00:00:20.670> wobble<00:00:20.970> around<00:00:21.060> always<00:00:21.900> sometimes

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it'll wobble around always sometimes

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.120 
it'll wobble around always sometimes
break<00:00:23.100> stuff<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:24.140> it<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.289> pays<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
break stuff but it all pays out in the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
end when you can do this now it's not

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.420 
end when you can do this now it's not
really<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.719> hard<00:00:33.890> you<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:34.920> gotta<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
really that hard you just gotta get it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.840 
really that hard you just gotta get it
it's<00:00:35.820> balanced<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.110> eye<00:00:37.260> coordination

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's balanced good and eye coordination

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
it's balanced good and eye coordination
make<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.000> keep<00:00:39.210> spinning<00:00:39.690> without<00:00:39.809> knocking

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
make it keep spinning without knocking

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.190 
make it keep spinning without knocking
it<00:00:40.920> off<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.219> finger<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:42.300> eventually<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
it off your finger then eventually you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.540 
it off your finger then eventually you
can<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.410> from<00:00:43.559> middle<00:00:43.800> finger<00:00:44.010> pointer<00:00:44.520> finger

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
can go from middle finger pointer finger

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
can go from middle finger pointer finger
or<00:00:45.000> pointer<00:00:45.930> finger<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> no<00:00:46.530> finger<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.129> ring

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
or pointer finger to no finger to ring

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
or pointer finger to no finger to ring
finger<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.590> pinky<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> thumb<00:00:51.260> back<00:00:52.260> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
finger to pinky it's a thumb back to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
finger to pinky it's a thumb back to
pointer<00:00:52.969> keep<00:00:53.969> doing<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.780> over

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
pointer keep doing this over and over

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
pointer keep doing this over and over
again<00:00:55.260> every<00:00:55.860> day<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.760> will<00:00:56.940> get

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
again every day and you will get

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.099 
again every day and you will get
eventually<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:59.190> day<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.609> did<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.809> knuckle

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
eventually then one day I did my knuckle

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
eventually then one day I did my knuckle
I<00:01:01.350> don't<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.160> how<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> thought<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.120> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
I don't know how I thought of this but I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.730 
I don't know how I thought of this but I
just<00:01:04.019> did<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.840> started<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> Swit

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
just did and then I started to Swit

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
just did and then I started to Swit
knuckles<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.220> harder<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.390> started

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
knuckles are harder but then I started

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.160 
knuckles are harder but then I started
switching<00:01:10.340> knuckles<00:01:11.659> can't<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.930> every

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
switching knuckles can't really do every

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.310 
switching knuckles can't really do every
knuckle<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.680> they're<00:01:13.860> small<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
knuckle because they're small but the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
knuckle because they're small but the
pointer<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.740> middle<00:01:16.950> knuckle<00:01:17.490> order<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
pointer and middle knuckle order good it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.190 
pointer and middle knuckle order good it
ends<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:21.060> switch<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:23.840> keep<00:01:24.840> doing<00:01:25.110> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
ends up and switch back keep doing this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.620 
ends up and switch back keep doing this
forever<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.860> ever<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.390> eventually

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
forever and ever them then eventually

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.710 
forever and ever them then eventually
you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.200> bounce<00:01:28.650> off<00:01:28.890> your<00:01:29.040> knee<00:01:29.450> well<00:01:30.450> maybe

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you can bounce off your knee well maybe

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.880 
you can bounce off your knee well maybe
not<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.110> except<00:01:31.350> sitting<00:01:31.560> down<00:01:31.740> but
