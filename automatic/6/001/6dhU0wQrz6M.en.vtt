so if you guys can understand that voice
you<00:02:18.910> guys<00:02:19.060> are<00:02:19.270> clever<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.840> um<00:02:20.470> here's<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
you guys are clever and um here's the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.460 
you guys are clever and um here's the
answer<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.240> actually<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.630> family<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.230> London
