00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
is a cluster of 100,000 stars we see

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.770 
is a cluster of 100,000 stars we see
stars<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.049> are<00:00:07.250> yellow<00:00:08.250> like<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.730> Sun<00:00:08.970> we

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
stars that are yellow like the Sun we

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.370 
stars that are yellow like the Sun we
see<00:00:09.929> stars<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.469> are<00:00:10.620> red<00:00:11.269> which<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.570> cooler

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
see stars that are red which are cooler

see stars that are red which are cooler
than<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.830> Sun<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.820> see<00:00:15.030> stars<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:15.809> blue

which are hotter than the Sun and in
some<00:00:19.560> sense<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.070> whole<00:00:20.250> story<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.910> stellar

some sense the whole story of stellar

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.800 
some sense the whole story of stellar
evolution<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:23.810> encapsulated

definitely<00:01:02.730> wasn't<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:04.290> amateur

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
definitely wasn't one of those amateur

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.800 
definitely wasn't one of those amateur
astronomers<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.150> had<00:01:06.450> in

astronomers that you know had in

astronomers that you know had in
childhood<00:01:07.880> already<00:01:08.880> had<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> telescope<00:01:09.810> or

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
childhood already had the telescope or

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
childhood already had the telescope or
looking<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> stars<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
looking at the stars and so on

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.890 
looking at the stars and so on
we<00:01:12.869> were<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.400> fairly<00:01:14.400> poor<00:01:14.790> family<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.659> never

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
we were a fairly poor family and I never

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.100 
we were a fairly poor family and I never
had<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> telescope<00:01:16.820> as<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> child<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
had a telescope as a child but I was a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.710 
had a telescope as a child but I was a
very<00:01:19.439> curious<00:01:19.799> child<00:01:20.060> there<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.150> no<00:01:21.299> question

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
very curious child there is no question

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.260 
very curious child there is no question
about<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:23.310> interested<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
about that I was interested in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.050 
about that I was interested in
everything<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:26.130> reading<00:01:26.490> almost

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
everything and I was reading almost

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480 
everything and I was reading almost
everything<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> could<00:01:28.680> read<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
everything I could read and in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.569 
everything I could read and in
particular<00:01:30.140> what<00:01:31.140> maybe<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.430> bit

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
particular what maybe was a little bit

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
particular what maybe was a little bit
unusual<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.810> used<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> read<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
unusual is that I used to read the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.450 
unusual is that I used to read the
entire<00:01:35.420> encyclopedias<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> would<00:01:37.979> read<00:01:38.250> all

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
entire encyclopedias so I would read all

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
entire encyclopedias so I would read all
the<00:01:38.759> volumes<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.780> volume<00:01:40.320> after

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the volumes you know one volume after

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700 
the volumes you know one volume after
the<00:01:40.740> next<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> encyclopedias<00:01:42.380> because<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> was

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the next of encyclopedias because I was

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.450 
the next of encyclopedias because I was
very<00:01:44.159> interested<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.880> many<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:46.619> didn't

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
very interested in many things I didn't

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
very interested in many things I didn't
know<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.450> become<00:01:48.840> an

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
know that I will become an

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.210 
know that I will become an
astrophysicist

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
astrophysicist

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.660 
astrophysicist
I<00:01:50.250> liked<00:01:50.909> mathematics<00:01:51.350> very<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.649> much<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.250> did

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
I liked mathematics very very much I did

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.030 
I liked mathematics very very much I did
actually<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.450> master's<00:01:54.990> thesis<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.829> did

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
actually a master's thesis and I did

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.920 
actually a master's thesis and I did
that<00:01:56.250> actually<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.850> theoretical<00:01:57.450> particle

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that actually in theoretical particle

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.499 
that actually in theoretical particle
physics<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.409> only<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.549> PhD<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.060> went<00:02:00.329> into

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
physics and only from a PhD I went into

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.980 
physics and only from a PhD I went into
astrophysics<00:02:01.229> no<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.460> happens<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.780> two

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
astrophysics no as it so happens the two

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
astrophysics no as it so happens the two
fields<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.430> small<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> subatomic

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
large of astrophysics have now become so

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.820 
large of astrophysics have now become so
close<00:02:12.660> together

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
close together

and<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.950> almost<00:02:17.190> doesn't<00:02:17.580> matter

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
and so on that it almost doesn't matter

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.000 
and so on that it almost doesn't matter
anymore<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.720> came<00:02:18.990> originally<00:02:19.470> from

anymore if you came originally from
particle<00:02:20.490> physics<00:02:20.820> or<00:02:21.060> astrophysics<00:02:21.270> you

particle physics or astrophysics you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.140 
particle physics or astrophysics you
know<00:02:22.110> we're<00:02:22.370> dealing<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.790> less<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
know we're dealing more or less with the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
know we're dealing more or less with the
same<00:02:24.240> questions

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.630 

when<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> universe<00:02:28.970> started<00:02:29.230> there<00:02:30.230> was<00:02:30.350> only

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
when the universe started there was only

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120 
when the universe started there was only
hydrogen<00:02:31.640> helium<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:33.320> little<00:02:33.770> bit<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
hydrogen helium and a little bit of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.130 
hydrogen helium and a little bit of
traces<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.240> few<00:02:35.450> other<00:02:35.600> things<00:02:35.900> like

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
traces of the few other things like

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.340 
traces of the few other things like
lithium<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.160> all<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:38.210> materials<00:02:39.020> that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
lithium and so on all the materials that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.100 
lithium and so on all the materials that
we<00:02:39.710> know<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.130> love<00:02:40.270> carbon<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.480> oxygen<00:02:41.600> and

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
we know and love carbon and oxygen and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.170 
we know and love carbon and oxygen and
iron<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.800> know<00:02:42.890> all<00:02:43.040> these<00:02:43.190> things<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.700> make

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
iron you know all these things that make

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.940 
iron you know all these things that make
our<00:02:44.420> bodies<00:02:44.900> they<00:02:45.680> were<00:02:45.740> made<00:02:46.160> inside<00:02:46.820> stars

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
our bodies they were made inside stars

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.100 
our bodies they were made inside stars
inside<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.220> hot<00:02:49.550> furnaces<00:02:50.330> at<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.690> Centers

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
inside the hot furnaces at the Centers

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.960 
inside the hot furnaces at the Centers
of<00:02:51.140> stars<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.190> Sun<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.580> more<00:02:52.760> massive

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
of stars like the Sun and more massive

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.450 
of stars like the Sun and more massive
than<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.330> Sun<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.350> what<00:02:54.560> happens<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.220> that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
than the Sun so what happens is that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.000 
than the Sun so what happens is that
those<00:02:55.700> stars<00:02:56.090> they<00:02:56.690> fuse<00:02:57.200> those<00:02:57.500> elements

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
those stars they fuse those elements

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.760 
those stars they fuse those elements
from<00:02:58.340> hydrogen<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.000> helium<00:02:59.240> they<00:03:00.050> fuse<00:03:00.530> them

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
from hydrogen and helium they fuse them

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.530 
from hydrogen and helium they fuse them
together<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.430> they<00:03:01.640> make<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.210> those

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
together and they make all those

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.630 
together and they make all those
elements<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.230> know<00:03:03.350> iron<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.370> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
elements you know iron and so on and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.300 
elements you know iron and so on and
oxygen<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.690> carbon<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.350> nitrogen<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.220> all

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
oxygen and carbon and nitrogen and all

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.370 
oxygen and carbon and nitrogen and all
those<00:03:07.520> things<00:03:07.790> they<00:03:08.150> make<00:03:08.390> them<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.959> then

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
those things they make them in and then

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.830 
those things they make them in and then
when<00:03:09.590> those<00:03:09.800> stars<00:03:10.130> explode<00:03:10.670> or<00:03:11.420> when<00:03:11.690> they

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
when those stars explode or when they

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.199 
when those stars explode or when they
eject<00:03:12.170> their<00:03:12.350> outer<00:03:12.530> layers<00:03:12.740> they<00:03:13.700> eject

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
eject their outer layers they eject

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.330 
eject their outer layers they eject
those<00:03:14.450> materials<00:03:15.140> into<00:03:15.440> interstellar<00:03:15.860> space

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
those materials into interstellar space

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.270 
those materials into interstellar space
and<00:03:16.580> then<00:03:17.390> from<00:03:17.810> those<00:03:18.110> materials<00:03:18.860> that<00:03:19.070> now

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
and then from those materials that now

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.940 
and then from those materials that now
formed<00:03:19.790> new<00:03:20.450> stars<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.020> planets<00:03:21.590> are<00:03:21.740> being

formed new stars and planets are being

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.900 
formed new stars and planets are being
born<00:03:22.390> including<00:03:23.390> our<00:03:23.630> own<00:03:23.900> solar<00:03:24.260> system

the observable universe alone there are

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.070 
the observable universe alone there are
something<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:14.750> 200<00:04:15.470> billion<00:04:15.980> galaxies<00:04:17.080> so

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
something like 200 billion galaxies so

just one member of a huge ensemble of

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.270 
just one member of a huge ensemble of
universes<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.690> in<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.200> respect<00:04:30.470> certainly

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
universes so in that respect certainly

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.430 
universes so in that respect certainly
our<00:04:31.430> physical<00:04:32.030> existence<00:04:32.360> has<00:04:32.780> become<00:04:33.200> less

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
our physical existence has become less

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.760 
our physical existence has become less
and<00:04:33.620> less<00:04:33.710> significant<00:04:34.610> however<00:04:35.620> there<00:04:36.620> is

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
and less significant however there is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.950 
and less significant however there is
something<00:04:37.039> in<00:04:37.370> all<00:04:37.490> of<00:04:37.640> this<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:38.120> which<00:04:38.479> makes

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
something in all of this it which makes

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800 
something in all of this it which makes
us<00:04:39.200> actually<00:04:39.590> very<00:04:39.919> significant

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
us actually very significant

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.890 
us actually very significant
and<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.639> we<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.090> discovered<00:04:43.570> all

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
and that is that we have discovered all

00:04:43.900 --> 00:05:11.270 
and that is that we have discovered all
that

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.340
