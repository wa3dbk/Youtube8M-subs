00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:12.249 
hi guys welcome back I have here a
spigen<00:00:04.259> Neo<00:00:04.770> Hybrid<00:00:07.760> Case<00:00:08.760> form<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.389> for

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.440 

having<00:00:13.259> recently<00:00:13.740> dropped<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.730> smashed

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
having recently dropped it and smashed

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.380 
having recently dropped it and smashed
it<00:00:15.630> master<00:00:16.320> screen<00:00:16.609> coming<00:00:17.609> back<00:00:17.789> from<00:00:17.970> repair

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it master screen coming back from repair

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.470 
it master screen coming back from repair
I<00:00:19.070> figured<00:00:20.070> maybe<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.789> should<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.090> after<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
I figured maybe I should look after it a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.849 
I figured maybe I should look after it a
bit<00:00:21.600> better<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> generally<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.710> using

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
bit better I generally don't like using

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.620 
bit better I generally don't like using
cases<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.609> mean<00:00:23.760> even<00:00:24.000> after<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.300> experience

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
cases I mean even after this experience

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
cases I mean even after this experience
whereas<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.990> might<00:00:25.199> not<00:00:25.410> use<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.740> case<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
whereas I might not use the case and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
whereas I might not use the case and
much<00:00:29.090> after<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> sticky<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:30.570> other<00:00:30.810> side<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
much after a sticky bit other side I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.490 
much after a sticky bit other side I
missed<00:00:31.380> them

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.020 

but<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> thought<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.980> looked<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
but I thought this looked one of the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.290 
but I thought this looked one of the
sort<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> nice<00:00:42.809> alkyne<00:00:43.410> cases<00:00:43.890> quite<00:00:44.129> classy<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
sort of nice alkyne cases quite classy I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
sort of nice alkyne cases quite classy I
thought<00:00:49.789> it<00:00:50.789> comes<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.289> separate

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
thought it comes in to the two separate

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.020 
thought it comes in to the two separate
elements<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> white<00:00:55.699> bumper<00:00:56.699> almost

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
elements or the white bumper almost

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
elements or the white bumper almost
there<00:00:57.180> goes<00:00:57.270> around<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> outside<00:00:57.539> then<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
there goes around the outside then the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040 
there goes around the outside then the
plastic<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.879> protection<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.629> more

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
plastic so it's protection really more

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
plastic so it's protection really more
than<00:01:01.140> anything<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:02.670> gonna<00:01:02.730> take<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> bump

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
than anything so I'm gonna take a bump

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.380 
than anything so I'm gonna take a bump
Rafa<00:01:03.930> sit<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.439> into<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> plastic<00:01:08.390> hopefully

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
Rafa sit it into the plastic hopefully

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
Rafa sit it into the plastic hopefully
it<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:09.960> sit<00:01:10.320> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> bumper<00:01:11.520> nice<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it will sit into the bumper nice and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.350 
it will sit into the bumper nice and
easy<00:01:12.060> okay<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.369> little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> persuasion<00:01:15.090> on

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
easy okay a little bit of persuasion on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.590 
easy okay a little bit of persuasion on
the<00:01:15.450> edges<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:18.229> think<00:01:19.229> we're<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:23.390> bit<00:01:24.390> I'm

the edges there I think we're a bit I'm

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
the edges there I think we're a bit I'm
certainly<00:01:25.700> Sonia<00:01:26.700> works<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.530> obviously<00:01:28.890> very

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
certainly Sonia works so obviously very

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.140 
certainly Sonia works so obviously very
