00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
in this video I'll be dealing with the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
in this video I'll be dealing with the
PCI<00:00:20.609> Express<00:00:20.670> x1<00:00:21.630> slot<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.320> why<00:00:22.470> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
PCI Express x1 slot and that's why I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.840 
PCI Express x1 slot and that's why I
have<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> diagram<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.189> screen<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.580> help<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
have a diagram on screen to help you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880 
have a diagram on screen to help you
guys<00:00:24.000> out<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.390> determine<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.140> kind<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> Wi-Fi

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
guys out to determine what kind of Wi-Fi

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
guys out to determine what kind of Wi-Fi
card<00:00:26.220> interface<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:26.970> card<00:00:27.150> uses<00:00:27.510> so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
card interface that your card uses so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.349 
card interface that your card uses so
again<00:00:28.680> mine<00:00:28.859> uses<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> x1<00:00:29.699> slot<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.179> at

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
again mine uses the x1 slot which is at

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
again mine uses the x1 slot which is at
the<00:00:30.480> top<00:00:30.689> there<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> middle

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the top there and then in the middle

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
the top there and then in the middle
there's<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> PCI<00:00:32.820> Express<00:00:32.880> x16<00:00:33.870> slot<00:00:34.440> which

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
there's the PCI Express x16 slot which

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170 
there's the PCI Express x16 slot which
is<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.890> used<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.190> Wi-Fi<00:00:35.640> cards<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is not used for Wi-Fi cards this is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.030 
is not used for Wi-Fi cards this is
actually<00:00:36.510> used<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.809> graphics<00:00:37.290> cards<00:00:37.620> so

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
actually used for graphics cards so

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
actually used for graphics cards so
don't<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.399> confused<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.660> one

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
don't get them confused and the one

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.190 
don't get them confused and the one
below<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.110> x16<00:00:40.890> slot<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> PCI<00:00:42.149> slot<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
below the x16 slot is the PCI slot and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.319 
below the x16 slot is the PCI slot and
this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:44.070> very<00:00:44.309> old<00:00:44.489> slot<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> no

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
this is a very very old slot which is no

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
this is a very very old slot which is no
longer<00:00:45.539> used<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
longer used and if you do have one of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.860 
longer used and if you do have one of
these<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.730> very<00:00:47.969> outdated

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
these it's very very outdated

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319 
these it's very very outdated

sell<00:00:51.719> PCI<00:00:52.170> Wi-Fi<00:00:53.100> cards<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.969> much

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
sell PCI Wi-Fi cards but it is much

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
sell PCI Wi-Fi cards but it is much
different<00:00:54.449> very<00:00:55.170> very<00:00:55.440> different<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:55.980> PCI

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
different very very different from PCI

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.760

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
right card and I'll be doing again x1 in

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.569 
right card and I'll be doing again x1 in
this<00:01:01.289> video<00:01:01.500> tutorial<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.039> let's<00:01:02.190> continue<00:01:02.370> on

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
this video tutorial so let's continue on

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
this video tutorial so let's continue on
that<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.719> let's<00:01:03.899> begin<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> installation

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that side let's begin the installation

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.560 
that side let's begin the installation
process<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.430> Wi-Fi<00:01:05.760> card<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> first

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
process for the Wi-Fi card so the first

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.490 
process for the Wi-Fi card so the first
thing<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
open<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> side<00:01:08.250> panel<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.850> computer

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
open up the side panel on my computer

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
open up the side panel on my computer
after<00:01:09.450> you've<00:01:09.869> opened<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> side<00:01:10.650> panel<00:01:10.979> on

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
after you've opened up the side panel on

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
after you've opened up the side panel on
your<00:01:11.220> computer<00:01:11.580> case<00:01:11.760> make<00:01:12.090> sure<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.360> ground

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
your computer case make sure you ground

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
your computer case make sure you ground
yourself<00:01:12.869> by<00:01:13.229> touching<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> inside<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
yourself by touching the inside of the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
yourself by touching the inside of the
case<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> don't<00:01:15.180> ground<00:01:15.360> yourself<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
case if you don't ground yourself you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.270 
case if you don't ground yourself you
could<00:01:15.900> potentially<00:01:16.140> static<00:01:16.770> shock<00:01:17.040> other

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
could potentially static shock other

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
could potentially static shock other
parts<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.939> computer<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.869> will

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
parts in your computer and this will

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
parts in your computer and this will
render<00:01:19.229> them<00:01:19.380> useless<00:01:19.729> depending<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.820> what

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
render them useless depending on what

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.190 
render them useless depending on what
motherboard<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> may<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
motherboard you have it may be a little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
motherboard you have it may be a little
difficult<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> PCIe<00:01:23.700> slot<00:01:24.180> so

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
difficult to get to the PCIe slot so

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
difficult to get to the PCIe slot so
here<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.810> removing<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.350> second<00:01:25.830> 560<00:01:26.490> Ti
