training hall or training facility or

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
training hall or training facility or
something<00:00:05.160> like<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.299> see<00:00:06.480> only<00:00:06.720> one

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
something like that you can see only one

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.629 
something like that you can see only one
unit<00:00:07.379> one<00:00:07.560> spawn<00:00:08.280> point<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:10.190> we<00:00:11.190> are<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
unit one spawn point and we are in the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.849 
unit one spawn point and we are in the
matrix<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.510> see<00:00:18.720> very<00:00:18.990> flashy<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.650> terms

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
matrix you can see very flashy in terms

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.990 
matrix you can see very flashy in terms
of<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:21.330> lasers<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.519> feels<00:00:26.640> like

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of the lasers this really feels like

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
of the lasers this really feels like
your<00:00:27.119> classic<00:00:27.630> deathmatch<00:00:28.080> map<00:00:30.529> could<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
your classic deathmatch map could be you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.790 
your classic deathmatch map could be you
know<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.099> unreal<00:00:32.489> tournament<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> quake

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
know an unreal tournament or a quake

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.860 
know an unreal tournament or a quake
actually<00:00:34.800> supports<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.430> capture<00:00:35.940> flag<00:00:36.180> which

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
actually supports one capture flag which

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500 
actually supports one capture flag which
is<00:00:37.020> pretty<00:00:37.110> cool<00:00:37.879> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.239> really

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
is pretty cool you can see it's really

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.110 
is pretty cool you can see it's really
cool<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.899> enemies<00:00:40.290> die<00:00:40.760> little<00:00:41.760> bits<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
cool how the enemies die little bits and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
cool how the enemies die little bits and
pixels<00:00:44.989> it's<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.440> straightforward<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
pixels it's really straightforward but I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
pixels it's really straightforward but I
know<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.300> guys<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.750> like

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
know that a lot of guys actually like

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.639 
know that a lot of guys actually like
this<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.520> though<00:00:50.930> how<00:00:51.930> actually

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this you can see though how actually

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.549 
this you can see though how actually
it's<00:00:52.829> only<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.160> side<00:00:53.989> where<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it's only on one side where you need to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.819 
it's only on one side where you need to
go<00:00:55.620> up

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.819 

very<00:01:00.789> basic<00:01:01.269> though<00:01:01.449> because<00:01:02.440> there's<00:01:02.710> only

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
very basic though because there's only

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:12.380 
very basic though because there's only
one<00:01:03.039> unit<00:01:03.339> I<00:01:03.519> guess<00:01:04.330> there's<00:01:04.750> no<00:01:05.850> hero<00:01:06.850> units

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.090 

we<00:01:13.390> are<00:01:13.509> getting<00:01:13.659> owned<00:01:13.930> though<00:01:14.320> let's<00:01:14.860> sure

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
we are getting owned though let's sure

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:26.100 
we are getting owned though let's sure
about<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:25.210> can<00:01:25.330> see<00:01:25.450> there's<00:01:25.780> not<00:01:26.080> a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
about that you can see there's not a

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.539 
about that you can see there's not a
whole<00:01:26.259> lot<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.409> cover<00:01:26.679> to<00:01:26.860> hide<00:01:26.890> behind<00:01:27.070> just<00:01:27.490> a

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
whole lot of cover to hide behind just a

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.160 
whole lot of cover to hide behind just a
little<00:01:27.789> bit<00:01:29.789> we're<00:01:30.789> just<00:01:30.880> kinda<00:01:31.720> okay<00:01:31.929> because

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
little bit we're just kinda okay because

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.020 
little bit we're just kinda okay because
you<00:01:32.229> only<00:01:32.380> have<00:01:32.560> one<00:01:32.890> type<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.280> unit<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.940> the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
you only have one type of unit on the

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.130 
you only have one type of unit on the
battlefield<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.850> me<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.299> is<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.750> little<00:01:40.929> bit

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
battlefield for me it is a little bit

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.580 
battlefield for me it is a little bit
too<00:01:41.679> basic<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:43.240> again<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.720> as<00:01:43.929> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
too basic but then again it is as the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.649 
too basic but then again it is as the
map<00:01:44.709> says<00:01:44.890> also<00:01:45.069> a<00:01:45.190> training<00:01:45.850> facility<00:01:46.179> or

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
map says also a training facility or

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.850 
map says also a training facility or
training<00:01:47.049> map<00:01:47.200> or<00:01:47.440> whatever<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.409> guess<00:01:50.679> that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
training map or whatever so I guess that

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.260 
training map or whatever so I guess that
was<00:01:51.159> kind<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.490> their<00:01:51.640> thing<00:01:51.909> with<00:01:52.060> not

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
was kind of their thing with not

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.940 
was kind of their thing with not
expecting<00:01:52.720> too<00:01:52.899> much<00:01:55.440> maybe<00:01:56.440> like<00:01:56.679> it<00:01:56.860> though

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
expecting too much maybe like it though

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.469 
expecting too much maybe like it though
