00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and it's just over just over an hour off

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
and it's just over just over an hour off
we<00:00:38.219> started<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.940> five<00:00:39.120> minutes<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.020> look

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
we started now in five minutes and look

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.459 
we started now in five minutes and look
it's<00:00:40.890> nearly<00:00:41.129> done<00:00:41.370> nice<00:00:41.940> no<00:00:42.149> person

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
it's nearly done nice no person

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
it's nearly done nice no person
obviously<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> will<00:00:44.160> depend<00:00:44.280> on

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
obviously a lot of this will depend on

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.650 
obviously a lot of this will depend on
how<00:00:44.550> fast<00:00:44.760> your<00:00:44.940> internet<00:00:45.210> connection<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
how fast your internet connection is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.330 
how fast your internet connection is
apparently<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.440> around<00:00:46.710> five<00:00:47.039> gigabytes

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
apparently it's around five gigabytes

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.389 
apparently it's around five gigabytes
the<00:00:47.760> update<00:00:48.770> but<00:00:49.770> yeah<00:00:49.860> I'm<00:00:49.920> surprised<00:00:50.219> it's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the update but yeah I'm surprised it's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.900 
the update but yeah I'm surprised it's
gone<00:00:50.550> quite<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.360> smoothly<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.590> far<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
gone quite so smoothly so far now it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.959 
gone quite so smoothly so far now it's
downloaded<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.920> currently<00:00:56.640> updating

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
downloaded and it's currently updating

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
downloaded and it's currently updating
and<00:00:58.609> we'll<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.789> what<00:00:59.940> happens<00:01:00.030> once<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.140> hear

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and we'll see what happens once we hear

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.429 
and we'll see what happens once we hear
a<00:01:01.320> hundred<00:01:01.559> percent<00:01:02.930> which<00:01:03.930> hopefully<00:01:04.140> won't

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
a hundred percent which hopefully won't

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.789 
a hundred percent which hopefully won't
be<00:01:04.559> too<00:01:04.680> long<00:01:04.710> although<00:01:05.930> fool<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.110> you

know what that means but maybe it means

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.210 
know what that means but maybe it means
it's<00:01:25.259> doing<00:01:25.590> something<00:01:26.479> hopefully

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220

still on the blue light is on the
console<00:01:38.860> itself<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.270> is<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.510> point

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
console itself and this is the point

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.030 
console itself and this is the point
where<00:01:43.870> you<00:01:44.170> probably<00:01:44.470> shouldn't<00:01:44.860> touch

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
where you probably shouldn't touch

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.620 
where you probably shouldn't touch
anything<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.560> case<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:48.760> all<00:01:48.940> goes<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.450> pop

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
anything just in case it all goes to pop

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.270 
anything just in case it all goes to pop
and<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:51.160> end<00:01:51.310> up<00:01:51.460> with<00:01:51.580> an<00:01:51.730> expensive<00:01:52.210> brick

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and you end up with an expensive brick

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.920 
and you end up with an expensive brick
so<00:01:54.280> there<00:01:54.400> we<00:01:54.490> go<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:54.880> tap<00:01:55.540> icon<00:01:57.930> hopefully

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
so there we go this tap icon hopefully

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.350 
so there we go this tap icon hopefully
