basically<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.290> want<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> beat<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.370> much<00:02:47.760> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
basically we want to beat in as much of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.479 
basically we want to beat in as much of
the<00:02:48.300> all-purpose<00:02:48.600> flour<00:02:48.870> into<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.920> batter<00:02:50.130> is

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the all-purpose flour into the batter is

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.640 
the all-purpose flour into the batter is
possibly<00:02:51.000> using<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> mixer<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.080> when<00:02:52.560> you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
possibly using the mixer and when you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.260 
possibly using the mixer and when you
can't<00:02:52.860> use<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.130> mixer<00:02:53.430> anymore<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.060> use

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
can't use the mixer anymore just use

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.699 
can't use the mixer anymore just use
it's<00:02:54.390> good<00:02:55.489> when<00:02:56.489> ten<00:02:56.790> minutes<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.239> gone<00:02:57.270> by

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
it's good when ten minutes have gone by

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.710 
it's good when ten minutes have gone by
not<00:02:58.709> only<00:02:59.040> are<00:02:59.130> we<00:02:59.160> both<00:02:59.430> but<00:03:00.209> at<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.420> point
