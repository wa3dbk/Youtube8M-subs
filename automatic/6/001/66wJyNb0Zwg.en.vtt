00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.049

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.049

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.540
 skeleton pokeboll he disappears onion is 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.380

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.820
 it also works for flying 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.240

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.290

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.650

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:12.760
 and the same do and heal as far as 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:19.460

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:27.470
