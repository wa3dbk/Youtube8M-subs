longboarding<00:00:03.149> we're<00:00:03.449> doing<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.750> review<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
longboarding we're doing a review on the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.280 
longboarding we're doing a review on the
new<00:00:04.589> bustin<00:00:04.980> 5<00:00:05.190> oz<00:00:05.810> this<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> all-new

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
new bustin 5 oz this is the all-new

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.250 
new bustin 5 oz this is the all-new
busting<00:00:07.980> formula<00:00:08.519> urethane<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:10.019> doesn't

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
busting formula urethane and it doesn't

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.709 
busting formula urethane and it doesn't
have<00:00:10.349> any<00:00:10.530> pigment<00:00:10.830> or<00:00:11.160> anything<00:00:11.599> supposed<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
have any pigment or anything supposed to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.360 
have any pigment or anything supposed to
make<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> wheels<00:00:13.259> more<00:00:13.530> reliable<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.309> more

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
make the wheels more reliable and more

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
make the wheels more reliable and more
buttery<00:00:14.880> these<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.990> sixty<00:00:16.320> four

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
buttery these are the sixty four

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
buttery these are the sixty four
millimeter<00:00:17.010> ones<00:00:17.279> they're<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.820> da<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.510> they

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
millimeter ones they're a da and they

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.820 
millimeter ones they're a da and they
have<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> 35<00:00:19.529> millimeter<00:00:19.980> contact<00:00:20.490> patch<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
have a 35 millimeter contact patch I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.380 
have a 35 millimeter contact patch I
have<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.949> 64<00:00:23.460> millimeter<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.000> they<00:00:24.150> also

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
have the 64 millimeter but they also

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
have the 64 millimeter but they also
come<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.730> 72<00:00:26.730> millimeter<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.890> 77<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.760> DA

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
come in 72 millimeter in 77 a and a DA

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.000 
come in 72 millimeter in 77 a and a DA
and<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.470> 64<00:00:31.470> millimeters<00:00:31.740> also<00:00:32.340> come<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.640> 85<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
and the 64 millimeters also come in 85 a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.350 
and the 64 millimeters also come in 85 a
so<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.280> things<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:36.090> wheels

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
so the things I like about these wheels

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.290 
so the things I like about these wheels
are<00:00:36.630> they're<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.860> buttery<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:39.059> leave

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
are they're really buttery they leave

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500 
are they're really buttery they leave
awesome<00:00:40.020> vein<00:00:40.290> lines<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.180> they're<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
awesome vein lines and they're it's a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.020 
awesome vein lines and they're it's a
really<00:00:42.809> controlled<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.700> smooth

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
really controlled really like smooth

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.720 
really controlled really like smooth
slide<00:00:45.829> when<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.920> first<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.610> have

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
slide when you first get them they have

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
slide when you first get them they have
really<00:00:48.120> rounded<00:00:48.539> lips<00:00:48.719> which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> nice

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
really rounded lips which is nice

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.930 
really rounded lips which is nice
because<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> makes<00:00:50.309> them<00:00:50.460> break<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because it makes them break in the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.600 
because it makes them break in the
slides<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.360> easily<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:53.250> makes<00:00:53.460> their

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
slides really easily and it makes their

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
slides really easily and it makes their
poke<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.239> smooth<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.410> wheels<00:00:55.620> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
poke up really smooth the wheels are

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.529 
poke up really smooth the wheels are
also<00:00:55.920> flippable<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.090> makes<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.420> easier

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
also flippable so it makes them easier

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.130 
also flippable so it makes them easier
to<00:00:58.010> rotate<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.329> keep<00:01:00.329> them<00:01:00.449> getting<00:01:00.690> uneven

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to rotate and keep them getting uneven

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.280 
to rotate and keep them getting uneven
wear<00:01:01.289> pattern<00:01:02.449> alright<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> bad

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
wear pattern alright so now the bad

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590 
wear pattern alright so now the bad
things<00:01:04.619> about<00:01:04.799> these<00:01:05.100> wheels<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:06.360> wheels

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
things about these wheels these wheels

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.260 
things about these wheels these wheels
leave<00:01:06.840> awesome<00:01:07.260> vein<00:01:07.799> lines<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
leave awesome vein lines but in the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.600 
leave awesome vein lines but in the
process<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.930> shave<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.740> lot<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> urethane

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
process they shave off a lot of urethane

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
process they shave off a lot of urethane
and<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.049> easy<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and it makes them really really easy to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.609 
and it makes them really really easy to
flat<00:01:13.979> spot<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.570> consistently<00:01:16.170> slide<00:01:16.470> at

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
flat spot if you consistently slide at

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.899 
flat spot if you consistently slide at
90<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.790> your

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
90 and that's how you like to do your

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.429 
90 and that's how you like to do your
slides<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.930> recommend<00:01:19.110> these

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
slides then I would not recommend these

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.980 
slides then I would not recommend these
wheels<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.880> flat<00:01:21.150> spot<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.720> had

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
wheels because they will flat spot I had

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.969 
wheels because they will flat spot I had
these<00:01:22.140> wheels<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.770> three<00:01:23.369> weeks<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
these wheels for three weeks and I

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
these wheels for three weeks and I
pretty<00:01:25.979> much<00:01:26.220> flat<00:01:26.460> fought<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> way

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pretty much flat fought it all the way

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
pretty much flat fought it all the way
down<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> core<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.490> fast

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
down to the core which is pretty fast

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
down to the core which is pretty fast
I<00:01:30.210> had<00:01:31.490> 88<00:01:32.490> metros<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.540> those<00:01:34.200> lasted<00:01:34.740> me

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
I had 88 metros and those lasted me

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.260 
I had 88 metros and those lasted me
about<00:01:35.040> six<00:01:35.340> months<00:01:35.640> whereas<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.030> only

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
about six months whereas these only

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
about six months whereas these only
lasted<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.110> three<00:01:37.409> weeks<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.700> not

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
lasted me like three weeks but it's not

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.240 
lasted me like three weeks but it's not
bad<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.030> their<00:01:39.299> price<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.930> cost<00:01:40.170> only<00:01:40.409> 42

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
bad for their price they cost only 42

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
bad for their price they cost only 42
bucks<00:01:41.549> off<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> bus<00:01:42.270> insight<00:01:42.720> another<00:01:43.590> bad

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
bucks off the bus insight another bad

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
bucks off the bus insight another bad
thing<00:01:43.799> about<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.250> wheels<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:45.409> probably<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
thing about these wheels is probably the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.010 
thing about these wheels is probably the
worst<00:01:46.799> thing<00:01:47.009> about<00:01:47.369> them<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.659> lots

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
worst thing about them if they have lots

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.249 
worst thing about them if they have lots
of<00:01:49.290> air<00:01:49.590> bubbles<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.340> over<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
of air bubbles all over them and as you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.219 
of air bubbles all over them and as you
can<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.220> hit<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.210> bubble<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
can see here I hit one bubble and it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.410 
can see here I hit one bubble and it
chunked<00:01:56.000> pretty<00:01:57.000> bad<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> inside<00:01:57.990> edge

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
chunked pretty bad on the inside edge

guys bust in five of those really nice
wheels<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.840> we'll<00:02:44.840> put<00:02:45.140> some<00:02:45.380> clips<00:02:45.709> right

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
wheels and we'll put some clips right

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.600 
wheels and we'll put some clips right
after<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.510> see<00:02:47.900> how<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:49.160> skate<00:02:49.459> them
