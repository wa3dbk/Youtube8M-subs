with it first it's made out of some

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.550 
with it first it's made out of some
pretty<00:00:29.039> tough<00:00:29.279> steel<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.410> say

four times heat treated steel and it's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090 
four times heat treated steel and it's
it<00:00:33.719> doesn't<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.230> doesn't<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.680> Bend<00:00:34.890> so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it doesn't it doesn't really Bend so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
up the tools that I found that I used

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
up the tools that I found that I used
most<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:40.230> trying<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.010> tool<00:00:41.250> out<00:00:41.280> where<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
most when trying this tool out where the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.139 
most when trying this tool out where the
letter<00:00:42.480> slash<00:00:42.989> box<00:00:43.379> opener<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.129> use<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.879> quite

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
letter slash box opener I use that quite

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.470 
letter slash box opener I use that quite
a<00:00:45.210> bit

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
a bit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.310 
a bit
but<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.969> con<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.629> far<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
but I do have one one con as far as the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.869 
but I do have one one con as far as the
tool<00:00:49.500> goes<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> does<00:00:50.579> involve

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
tool goes and that and that does involve

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.090 
tool goes and that and that does involve
that<00:00:51.059> box<00:00:51.390> opener<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> blade<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that box opener the way this blade is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.970 
that box opener the way this blade is
designed<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> push<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.199> things<00:00:55.469> just

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
designed you have to push on things just

designed you have to push on things just
right<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.489> order<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.809> effective

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
right in order for it to be an effective

right in order for it to be an effective
cutting<00:00:58.680> tool<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.129> wish<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.879> have

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
cutting tool I wish they would have

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
cutting tool I wish they would have
brought<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.750> cutting<00:01:01.440> edge<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.980> around<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
brought this cutting edge down around a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
brought this cutting edge down around a
little<00:01:02.760> bit<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.619> would<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:05.040> more

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
little bit more so that it would be more

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
little bit more so that it would be more
effective<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.150> opening<00:01:06.510> boxes<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
effective at at opening boxes and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
effective at at opening boxes and
envelopes<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.710> honestly<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
envelopes because honestly I used that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.200 
envelopes because honestly I used that
part<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> more<00:01:10.290> than<00:01:10.320> anything<00:01:10.770> else<00:01:11.210> as

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
part of this more than anything else as

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.719 
part of this more than anything else as
far<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.040> wrenches<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> are

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
far as the wrenches that are that are

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
far as the wrenches that are that are
built<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:16.110> never<00:01:16.259> used<00:01:16.470> any<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
built into it I have never used any of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.499 
built into it I have never used any of
them<00:01:17.070> although<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.820> no<00:01:17.970> doubt<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.210> they

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
them although I have no doubt that they

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
them although I have no doubt that they
work<00:01:18.920> but<00:01:19.920> given<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> size<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> tool<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
work but given the size of the tool and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
work but given the size of the tool and
how<00:01:21.090> awkward<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> use<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.470> don't

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
how awkward it would be to use I don't

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.289 
how awkward it would be to use I don't
think<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.040> reaching<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.820> first

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
think I would be reaching for this first

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.060 
think I would be reaching for this first
thing<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.409> was<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.740> only<00:01:25.950> option

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
thing it was if this was my only option

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
thing it was if this was my only option
I<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> purpose<00:01:27.479> but

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I would use it for that purpose but

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
I would use it for that purpose but
outside<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.850> much

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
outside of that I don't really see much

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
outside of that I don't really see much
use<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> wrench<00:01:30.930> side<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> things<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
use in the wrench side of things the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
use in the wrench side of things the
screwdriver<00:01:32.939> side<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> things<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> I

screwdriver side of things now that I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.590 
screwdriver side of things now that I
haven't<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.340> used<00:01:35.369> all<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> much<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
haven't really used all that much but I
