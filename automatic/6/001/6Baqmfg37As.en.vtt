00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
this didn't come with that it came with

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.080 
this didn't come with that it came with
like<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.310> white<00:02:45.810> top<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.519> like<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.549> covering

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
like a white top like like a covering

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.630 
like a white top like like a covering
over<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.420> but<00:02:50.200> once<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.650> take<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:51.010> off<00:02:51.220> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
over it but once you take that off you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.949 
over it but once you take that off you
might<00:02:51.819> as<00:02:51.910> well<00:02:51.970> take<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.239> off<00:02:52.450> because<00:02:52.660> if<00:02:52.900> you

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
might as well take it off because if you

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.360 
might as well take it off because if you
keep<00:02:53.200> putting<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.920> itch<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:54.220> going

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
keep putting that on the itch it's going

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.759 
keep putting that on the itch it's going
to<00:02:54.430> make<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.790> big<00:02:55.780> mess<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.349> it<00:02:56.500> ain't<00:02:56.620> really

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
to make a big mess so it ain't really

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.289 
to make a big mess so it ain't really
make<00:02:56.980> any<00:02:57.130> sense<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.519> keep<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.849> on<00:02:57.910> it

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
make any sense to keep that on it

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.539 
make any sense to keep that on it
so<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.110> took<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.470> off<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.890> then<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> holes<00:03:00.370> in

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
so I took that off and then the holes in

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.550 
so I took that off and then the holes in
here<00:03:00.670> are<00:03:00.880> extremely<00:03:01.750> big<00:03:01.989> they're<00:03:02.200> like<00:03:02.379> the

way to describe it you know when you put

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.879 
way to describe it you know when you put
on<00:06:06.000> a<00:06:06.060> primer<00:06:06.449> like<00:06:06.840> those<00:06:07.080> silicone<00:06:07.620> based

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
on a primer like those silicone based

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.830 
on a primer like those silicone based
primers<00:06:08.370> like<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.760> elf<00:06:08.940> one<00:06:09.240> or<00:06:09.389> the<00:06:09.509> babyface

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
primers like the elf one or the babyface

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.080 
primers like the elf one or the babyface
one<00:06:10.320> which<00:06:11.099> are<00:06:11.220> the<00:06:11.280> only<00:06:11.460> two<00:06:11.639> problems<00:06:11.970> I've

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
one which are the only two problems I've

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.980 
one which are the only two problems I've
ever<00:06:12.240> used<00:06:13.130> they<00:06:14.130> have

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
ever used they have

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.440 
ever used they have
like<00:06:15.140> a<00:06:15.410> silicone<00:06:16.070> feel<00:06:16.700> and<00:06:16.970> it<00:06:17.090> makes<00:06:17.270> your

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
like a silicone feel and it makes your

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.560 
like a silicone feel and it makes your
face<00:06:17.510> feel<00:06:18.260> like<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.590> baby's<00:06:19.160> bottom<00:06:19.400> like<00:06:20.330> it's

face feel like a baby's bottom like it's

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.550 
face feel like a baby's bottom like it's
just<00:06:20.810> so<00:06:21.020> soft<00:06:21.350> when<00:06:22.220> you<00:06:22.400> put<00:06:22.640> this<00:06:22.880> on<00:06:23.560> it

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
just so soft when you put this on it

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.700 
just so soft when you put this on it
doesn't<00:06:24.980> really<00:06:25.220> exactly<00:06:25.700> feel<00:06:26.440> like<00:06:27.440> a

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
doesn't really exactly feel like a

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.130 
doesn't really exactly feel like a
primer<00:06:28.070> or<00:06:28.400> something<00:06:28.760> like<00:06:28.880> that<00:06:28.940> but<00:06:29.780> it<00:06:29.930> has

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
primer or something like that but it has
