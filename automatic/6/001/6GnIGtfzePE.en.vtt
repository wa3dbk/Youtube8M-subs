rounding<00:00:01.260> mixed<00:00:02.070> numbers<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.179> video<00:00:03.540> I'm

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
rounding mixed numbers in this video I'm

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.110 
rounding mixed numbers in this video I'm
going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.290> show<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.680> how<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.220> round<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.819> mixed

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
going to show you how to round a mixed

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.960 
going to show you how to round a mixed
number<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.930> whole<00:00:07.440> number<00:00:07.790> here's<00:00:08.790> an

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
number to a whole number here's an

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
number to a whole number here's an
example<00:00:09.349> three<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.530> two-thirds<00:00:11.630> all<00:00:12.630> right

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
example three and two-thirds all right

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.320 
example three and two-thirds all right
are<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.290> gonna<00:00:13.440> write<00:00:13.679> into<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.009> three<00:00:14.549> or<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
are we gonna write into the three or is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
are we gonna write into the three or is
it<00:00:15.480> closer<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> four<00:00:16.710> are<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> go

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
it closer to the four are we going to go

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
it closer to the four are we going to go
up<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.730> four<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.240> answers<00:00:18.990> either<00:00:19.230> gonna<00:00:19.380> be

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
up to four so answers either gonna be

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.429 
up to four so answers either gonna be
three<00:00:20.100> or<00:00:20.250> four<00:00:20.340> well<00:00:21.330> first<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.840> all<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.080> look

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
three or four well first of all we look

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.580 
three or four well first of all we look
at<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> fraction<00:00:23.430> part<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.260> try<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
at the fraction part of it and we try to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
at the fraction part of it and we try to
work<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.949> well<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.220> two-thirds<00:00:26.760> greater<00:00:27.150> than

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
work out well as two-thirds greater than

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.759 
work out well as two-thirds greater than
the<00:00:27.570> half<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> less<00:00:29.310> enough<00:00:30.230> if<00:00:31.230> it's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the half or is it less enough if it's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.240 
the half or is it less enough if it's
greater<00:00:32.189> than<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.640> half<00:00:33.920> well<00:00:34.920> we're<00:00:35.070> gonna

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
greater than the half well we're gonna

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.819 
greater than the half well we're gonna
obviously<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.600> four<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.350> gonna<00:00:37.559> add

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
obviously go up to four we're gonna add

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.490 
obviously go up to four we're gonna add
one<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:39.149> three<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.260> be

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
one two three now it's just gonna be

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.389 
one two three now it's just gonna be
four

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.700 

if<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:48.210> less<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:49.489> 1/2<00:00:50.930> we're<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:52.469> keep

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
if it's less than 1/2 we're gonna keep

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.299 
if it's less than 1/2 we're gonna keep
bit<00:00:53.040> that's<00:00:53.489> 3<00:00:53.790> okay<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.110> 3<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.469> 2/3<00:00:55.800> would

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bit that's 3 okay so the 3 and 2/3 would

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.970 
bit that's 3 okay so the 3 and 2/3 would
be<00:00:56.430> closer<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.879> 3<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.290> do<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.769> well

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
be closer to 3 so how do we do this well

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.469 
be closer to 3 so how do we do this well
one<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> easiest<00:00:59.879> ways<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:02.479> visualize

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
one of the easiest ways is to visualize

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.800 
one of the easiest ways is to visualize
it<00:01:03.720> to<00:01:03.870> draw<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.229> all<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.570> draw<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it to draw it all right so just draw the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.649 
it to draw it all right so just draw the
2/3<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:07.860> draw<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> 3<00:01:08.580> year<00:01:08.940> just<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
2/3 you need to draw the 3 year just a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.040 
2/3 you need to draw the 3 year just a
fraction<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> 2/3<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> draw<00:01:12.450> bar<00:01:12.899> of

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
fraction of 2/3 so you draw bar of

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.580 
fraction of 2/3 so you draw bar of
chocolate

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
chocolate

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940 
chocolate
say<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.700> instance<00:01:15.110> okay<00:01:16.140> bar<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.710> chocolate

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
say for instance okay bar of chocolate

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
say for instance okay bar of chocolate
and<00:01:17.340> divide<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> bar<00:01:18.030> into<00:01:18.330> 3<00:01:18.540> pieces<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and divide that bar into 3 pieces and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
and divide that bar into 3 pieces and
you're<00:01:19.560> gonna<00:01:19.740> eat<00:01:20.070> two<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.550> these<00:01:20.729> pieces<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you're gonna eat two of these pieces and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
you're gonna eat two of these pieces and
you're<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.720> call<00:01:21.990> her<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.920> pieces

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you're gonna call her in the pieces

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.040 
you're gonna call her in the pieces
you're<00:01:23.490> gonna<00:01:23.670> eat<00:01:23.940> which<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.630> two

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
you're gonna eat which would be two

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.770 
you're gonna eat which would be two
three<00:01:25.950> pieces<00:01:26.160> altogether<00:01:26.429> and<00:01:26.940> two<00:01:27.390> pieces

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
three pieces altogether and two pieces

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
three pieces altogether and two pieces
you're<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> eat<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.100> let's<00:01:29.610> color<00:01:29.850> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you're going to eat so let's color in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.180 
you're going to eat so let's color in
two<00:01:30.270> pieces

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.999 

we're<00:01:35.190> gonna<00:01:35.369> decide<00:01:35.850> whether<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.289> amount

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
we're gonna decide whether this amount

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.760 
we're gonna decide whether this amount
is<00:01:38.399> greater<00:01:38.850> than<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> half<00:01:39.420> how<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.590> we

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
is greater than the half how are you we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200 
is greater than the half how are you we
gonna<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.280> well<00:01:41.520> we're<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.700> gonna<00:01:41.940> cut

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
gonna do this well we're just gonna cut

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.200 
gonna do this well we're just gonna cut
the<00:01:42.330> bar<00:01:42.539> enough<00:01:42.810> were<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:44.009> 1/2<00:01:44.429> on<00:01:44.789> this<00:01:44.970> bar

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the bar enough were is 1/2 on this bar

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.180 
the bar enough were is 1/2 on this bar
of<00:01:45.360> chocolate<00:01:45.539> well<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.920> by<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
of chocolate well it's right by this

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.419 
of chocolate well it's right by this
purple<00:01:47.550> X<00:01:47.899> roughly<00:01:48.899> we're<00:01:49.710> gonna<00:01:49.830> cut<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
purple X roughly we're gonna cut that

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.609 
purple X roughly we're gonna cut that
bar<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> middle<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.140> go<00:01:52.319> we

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
bar down in the middle there we go we

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.729 
bar down in the middle there we go we
can<00:01:52.800> see<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.340> yes<00:01:53.700> 2/3<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.899> greater<00:01:55.319> than<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.739 
can see that yes 2/3 is greater than the

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:59.960 
can see that yes 2/3 is greater than the
half<00:01:56.000> simple<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.479> therefore<00:01:57.989> we<00:01:58.679> would<00:01:58.950> add<00:01:59.520> 1

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
half simple so therefore we would add 1

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.900 
half simple so therefore we would add 1
to<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.239> 3<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:00.720> make<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.259> 4

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
to the 3 and make it 4

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.900 
to the 3 and make it 4
okay<00:02:02.940> 230<00:02:03.390> s<00:02:03.569> greater<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:03.959> 1/2<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:05.009> therefore

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
okay 230 s greater than 1/2 so therefore

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.690 
okay 230 s greater than 1/2 so therefore
3<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.509> 2/3<00:02:07.020> would<00:02:07.440> before<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.489> were<00:02:08.610> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
3 and 2/3 would before if we were to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.260 
3 and 2/3 would before if we were to
rounded<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> whole<00:02:10.020> number<00:02:10.670> if<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.940> was<00:02:12.030> less

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
rounded to a whole number if it was less

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.500 
rounded to a whole number if it was less
than<00:02:12.480> 1/2<00:02:12.690> we'll<00:02:13.319> keep<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.770> 3<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:15.270> there's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
than 1/2 we'll keep it as 3 and there's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.500 
than 1/2 we'll keep it as 3 and there's
another<00:02:15.870> way<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.590> look<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.670> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
another way we can look of this and you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
another way we can look of this and you
know<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.660> could<00:02:18.870> confuse<00:02:19.260> some<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.739> but<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
know I could confuse some of you but you

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.000 
know I could confuse some of you but you
might<00:02:20.400> pick<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.849> even<00:02:21.150> better<00:02:22.010> especially

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
might pick it up even better especially

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.339 
might pick it up even better especially
those<00:02:23.610> mathematical<00:02:24.080> geniuses<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.290> there

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
those mathematical geniuses out there

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.440 
those mathematical geniuses out there
but<00:02:26.190> 2/3

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
but 2/3

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.440 
but 2/3
well<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:29.099> we<00:02:29.220> find<00:02:29.610> an<00:02:29.790> equivalent<00:02:30.090> fraction

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
well can we find an equivalent fraction

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.290 
well can we find an equivalent fraction
to<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> half<00:02:31.580> with<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> denominator<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.840> 3

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:46.820 

wel<00:02:40.920> koude<00:02:42.540> because<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.569> half<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.989> three<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:45.360> 1.5

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
wel koude because a half of three is 1.5

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:55.530 
wel koude because a half of three is 1.5
so<00:02:47.830> they'll<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.099> 1.5<00:02:50.310> over<00:02:51.690> 3<00:02:53.580> 1<00:02:54.580> point<00:02:54.819> 5<00:02:54.970> over

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
so they'll be 1.5 over 3 1 point 5 over

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.470 
so they'll be 1.5 over 3 1 point 5 over
3<00:02:55.900> really<00:02:56.349> isn't<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.680> fraction<00:02:57.310> but<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:58.209> for

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
3 really isn't a fraction but just for

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.009 
3 really isn't a fraction but just for
this<00:03:00.180> situation<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.450> we're<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:01.989> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
this situation here we're just going to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.440 
this situation here we're just going to
use<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.349> well<00:03:03.040> we<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.340> look<00:03:03.489> at<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.760> 1<00:03:03.910> point<00:03:04.239> 5

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
use it well we can look at the 1 point 5

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.119 
use it well we can look at the 1 point 5
over<00:03:04.810> 3<00:03:05.019> we<00:03:05.140> could<00:03:05.260> say<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.739> equivalent

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
over 3 we could say this is equivalent

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.770 
over 3 we could say this is equivalent
to<00:03:06.790> 1<00:03:07.000> over<00:03:07.360> 2

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
to 1 over 2

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.170 
to 1 over 2
this<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.200> 1/2<00:03:08.530> written<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.670> way<00:03:09.819> with<00:03:10.150> a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
this is 1/2 written in a way with a

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.319 
this is 1/2 written in a way with a
denominator<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.230> 3<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.670> question<00:03:13.150> now<00:03:13.299> is

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
denominator of 3 the question now is

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.440 
denominator of 3 the question now is
will<00:03:13.840> 1.5<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.250> compare<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
will 1.5 we can compare that to the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.509 
will 1.5 we can compare that to the
numerator<00:03:16.989> 2<00:03:17.769> over<00:03:18.040> 3<00:03:18.340> 2<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.599> 2<00:03:20.160> greater<00:03:21.160> than

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
numerator 2 over 3 2 so 2 greater than

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.369 
numerator 2 over 3 2 so 2 greater than
1.5<00:03:22.299> or<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:23.140> 2<00:03:23.410> less<00:03:24.099> than<00:03:24.480> 1.5<00:03:25.480> well<00:03:26.019> 2<00:03:26.349> is

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
1.5 or is 2 less than 1.5 well 2 is

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.940 
1.5 or is 2 less than 1.5 well 2 is
greater<00:03:27.099> than<00:03:27.250> 1.5<00:03:28.290> automatically<00:03:29.290> telling

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
greater than 1.5 automatically telling

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.910 
greater than 1.5 automatically telling
us<00:03:30.129> that<00:03:30.849> it's<00:03:31.090> greater<00:03:31.450> than<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> 1/2<00:03:31.989> 2/3<00:03:32.680> is

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
us that it's greater than the 1/2 2/3 is

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.199 
us that it's greater than the 1/2 2/3 is
greater<00:03:33.280> than<00:03:33.610> 1/2<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.799> add<00:03:36.010> 1<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.700> 300

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
greater than 1/2 so we add 1 to the 300

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.960 
greater than 1/2 so we add 1 to the 300
make<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.870> 4<00:03:38.370> 3<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.519> 2/3<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:41.250> for<00:03:42.250> when<00:03:42.609> we<00:03:42.700> round

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
make it 4 3 and 2/3 is for when we round

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.910 
make it 4 3 and 2/3 is for when we round
it<00:03:43.090> let's<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:43.959> another<00:03:44.079> look<00:03:44.500> at<00:03:44.650> another

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
it let's have another look at another

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:59.030 
it let's have another look at another
example<00:03:46.680> -<00:03:47.850> 21<00:03:48.850> +<00:03:49.799> 7<00:03:50.799> over<00:03:51.579> 12

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.100 

now<00:03:59.580> how<00:03:59.790> are<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:00.269> going<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.540> do<00:04:00.629> is<00:04:00.750> we're

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
now how are we going to do is we're

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.660 
now how are we going to do is we're
going<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.439> bar<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.709> chocolate<00:04:01.920> method<00:04:02.519> if

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
going to the bar of chocolate method if

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.640 
going to the bar of chocolate method if
we<00:04:02.909> want<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.659> I'm<00:04:03.780> gonna<00:04:03.900> jump<00:04:04.200> onto<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.620> next

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
we want but I'm gonna jump onto the next

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.420 
we want but I'm gonna jump onto the next
one

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
one

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.319 
one
because<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:07.560> know<00:04:07.680> finding<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.430> 7<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:08.790> 12<00:04:09.180> is

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
because you know finding of 7 over 12 is

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.750 
because you know finding of 7 over 12 is
greater<00:04:09.599> than<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.170> half<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:11.489> actually

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
greater than the half it's actually

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.619 
greater than the half it's actually
quite<00:04:11.939> easy<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.480> do<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.349> this<00:04:13.500> method<00:04:14.629> so

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
quite easy if we do it this method so

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.740 
quite easy if we do it this method so
find<00:04:16.410> an<00:04:16.560> equivalent<00:04:16.829> fraction<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> half

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
find an equivalent fraction to a half

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.319 
find an equivalent fraction to a half
with<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> denominator<00:04:19.919> of<00:04:20.519> 12

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
with a denominator of 12

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.850 
with a denominator of 12
well<00:04:21.989> 7<00:04:22.770> /<00:04:23.100> 12<00:04:26.240> an<00:04:27.240> equivalent<00:04:27.870> fraction<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.830> a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
well 7 / 12 an equivalent fraction to a

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:37.730 
well 7 / 12 an equivalent fraction to a
half<00:04:30.350> with<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.380> denominator<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:32.280> 12<00:04:33.470> would<00:04:34.470> be<00:04:36.740> 6

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
half with a denominator of 12 would be 6

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.140 
half with a denominator of 12 would be 6
over<00:04:38.010> 12<00:04:38.610> 6<00:04:39.120> over<00:04:39.510> 12<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.430> equivalent<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.910> 1

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
over 12 6 over 12 is equivalent to 1

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.680 
over 12 6 over 12 is equivalent to 1
over<00:04:42.960> 2<00:04:43.310> now<00:04:44.310> we<00:04:44.370> look<00:04:44.639> at<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.910> 6<00:04:45.180> now<00:04:45.389> look<00:04:45.570> at

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
over 2 now we look at the 6 now look at

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.469 
over 2 now we look at the 6 now look at
the<00:04:45.780> 7th<00:04:46.260> at<00:04:46.350> 7<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.889> greater<00:04:47.130> than<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.940> 6

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
the 7th at 7 is greater than the 6

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.670 
the 7th at 7 is greater than the 6
so<00:04:49.080> therefore<00:04:49.289> 7<00:04:49.830> over<00:04:50.010> 12<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.430> greater<00:04:51.000> so

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
so therefore 7 over 12 is greater so

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.890 
so therefore 7 over 12 is greater so
therefore<00:04:52.680> we<00:04:52.800> add<00:04:52.949> 1<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.550> 21<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.389> we<00:04:54.720> get

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
therefore we add 1 to the 21 and we get

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.330 
therefore we add 1 to the 21 and we get
22<00:04:55.590> so<00:04:56.280> 21<00:04:56.699> +<00:04:57.060> 7<00:04:57.600> twelfths<00:04:58.050> rounded<00:04:59.010> your<00:04:59.190> whole

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
22 so 21 + 7 twelfths rounded your whole

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.800 
22 so 21 + 7 twelfths rounded your whole
number<00:04:59.550> would<00:05:00.210> be<00:05:00.510> 22<00:05:01.699> it's<00:05:02.699> closer<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.150> 22

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
number would be 22 it's closer to 22

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.470 
number would be 22 it's closer to 22
then<00:05:04.699> 21<00:05:05.960> thanks<00:05:06.960> for<00:05:07.110> listening
