00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
you have to do file by file if it takes

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.909 
you have to do file by file if it takes
forever<00:05:58.220> cuz<00:05:58.640> mine<00:05:59.020> kept<00:06:00.020> on<00:06:00.140> getting<00:06:00.350> errors

to work is on your hard drive actually I

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.880 
to work is on your hard drive actually I
don't<00:07:21.030> think<00:07:21.180> it<00:07:21.270> worked<00:07:21.479> at<00:07:21.720> I<00:07:22.050> don't<00:07:22.860> think

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890 
don't think it worked at I don't think

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.920 
don't think it worked at I don't think
that's<00:07:23.130> the<00:07:23.340> only<00:07:23.370> way<00:07:23.760> it<00:07:23.880> works<00:07:24.030> but<00:07:24.330> that's

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
that's the only way it works but that's

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.250 
that's the only way it works but that's
the<00:07:25.110> easiest<00:07:25.590> way<00:07:26.479> but<00:07:27.479> I<00:07:27.600> do<00:07:27.660> it<00:07:27.870> because<00:07:27.960> then

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
the easiest way but I do it because then

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.469 
the easiest way but I do it because then
I<00:07:28.350> could<00:07:28.410> put<00:07:28.710> more<00:07:28.860> games<00:07:29.130> on<00:07:29.430> my<00:07:29.610> xbox<00:07:30.090> and

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
I could put more games on my xbox and

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:31.790 
I could put more games on my xbox and
I'll<00:07:30.570> have<00:07:30.690> to<00:07:30.780> put<00:07:30.930> them<00:07:31.050> on<00:07:31.110> my<00:07:31.140> USB<00:07:31.380> Drive

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 
I'll have to put them on my USB Drive

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.909 
I'll have to put them on my USB Drive
because<00:07:32.760> it<00:07:32.880> will<00:07:33.000> take<00:07:33.150> up<00:07:33.270> room<00:07:33.450> fast<00:07:33.919> but

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 
because it will take up room fast but

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:36.950 
because it will take up room fast but
