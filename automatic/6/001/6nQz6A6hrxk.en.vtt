00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
realized was that this isn't the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.260 
realized was that this isn't the
important<00:01:25.420> part<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.350> idea<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.149> back

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
important part the idea is get it back

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.790 
important part the idea is get it back
to<00:01:28.420> here<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:28.899> it's<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.229> hitting<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.560> wall

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
to here and it's like hitting a wall

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.740 
to here and it's like hitting a wall
you're<00:01:30.340> gonna<00:01:30.910> your<00:01:31.090> wrist<00:01:31.119> as<00:01:31.390> get<00:01:31.600> hit

kind<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.510> disoriented<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.930> back<00:02:32.959> this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
kind of disoriented it back this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.490 
kind of disoriented it back this
way<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.739> hire<00:02:34.489> back<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:34.790> way<00:02:35.260> basically<00:02:36.260> just

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
way I hire back this way basically just

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:53.059 
way I hire back this way basically just
relax<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.250> when<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.790> hits<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.180> wall<00:02:39.670> snap<00:02:40.670> for

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.800 

I<00:02:53.159> don't<00:02:53.730> normally<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.329> talk<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.659> they're

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
I don't normally like to talk if they're

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:14.690 
I don't normally like to talk if they're
not<00:02:54.959> same<00:02:55.349> time

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.760 

all<00:03:15.270> right<00:03:15.420> hopefully<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.410> mechanics

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
all right hopefully got the mechanics

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.960 
all right hopefully got the mechanics
down<00:03:16.920> after<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.280> I'm<00:03:17.430> gonna<00:03:17.520> step<00:03:17.760> back<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
down after that I'm gonna step back a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.750 
down after that I'm gonna step back a
little<00:03:18.090> bit<00:03:19.160> I'm<00:03:20.160> gonna<00:03:20.280> step<00:03:20.459> back<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> little

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
little bit I'm gonna step back a little

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.260 
little bit I'm gonna step back a little
bit<00:03:21.050> now<00:03:22.050> one<00:03:22.380> thing<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.760> an<00:03:23.760> argument<00:03:23.940> feel

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
bit now one thing that an argument feel

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.760 
bit now one thing that an argument feel
make<00:03:24.420> four<00:03:24.630> notes<00:03:24.930> been<00:03:25.110> throwing<00:03:25.349> is<00:03:25.590> that

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
make four notes been throwing is that

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.800 
make four notes been throwing is that
you<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.459> use<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> same<00:03:26.880> technique<00:03:27.390> over

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
you can use the same technique over

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.320 
you can use the same technique over
various<00:03:28.500> distances<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.430> you'll<00:03:29.819> still<00:03:30.060> feel

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
various distances and you'll still feel

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.840 
various distances and you'll still feel
his<00:03:30.599> apart<00:03:31.020> point<00:03:31.260> first<00:03:31.440> that's<00:03:32.400> true<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.760> a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
his apart point first that's true in a

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.370 
his apart point first that's true in a
sense<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.270> it's<00:03:33.450> not<00:03:33.630> an<00:03:33.750> identical<00:03:34.080> throw

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
sense but it's not an identical throw

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.270 
sense but it's not an identical throw
every<00:03:34.560> time<00:03:37.520> from<00:03:38.520> here<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.769> for<00:03:41.130> back

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
every time from here then one for back

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.490 
every time from here then one for back
here<00:03:44.390> take<00:03:45.390> more<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.690> an<00:03:45.780> action<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.170> slow<00:03:46.380> it

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
here take more of an action to slow it

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.860 
here take more of an action to slow it
down<00:03:46.530> meaning<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.580> different<00:03:47.940> more<00:03:48.690> wrist

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
down meaning it's different more wrist

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.809 
down meaning it's different more wrist
action<00:03:49.130> now<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.340> same<00:03:50.489> way<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.640> they

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
action now it's the same way that they

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.140 
action now it's the same way that they
did<00:03:50.880> style<00:03:51.470> something<00:03:52.470> out<00:03:52.590> here<00:03:52.920> I'm<00:03:53.819> going

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
did style something out here I'm going

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.420 
did style something out here I'm going
to<00:03:54.590> have<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.860> little<00:03:55.950> more<00:03:56.100> my<00:03:56.220> arm

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
to have to get a little more my arm

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:34.399 
to have to get a little more my arm

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
you had a thought those with the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.399 
you had a thought those with the

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.240 
bullseye alright so again those were
sort<00:04:41.409> of<00:04:41.530> side<00:04:41.710> I'm<00:04:41.830> gonna<00:04:41.949> star<00:04:42.129> some

sort of side I'm gonna star some

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:50.100 
sort of side I'm gonna star some
overhead<00:04:42.490> one<00:04:42.669> out<00:04:42.970> over<00:04:43.930> hand

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110

but<00:06:31.560> it's<00:06:31.740> spinning<00:06:32.190> throw<00:06:32.550> it<00:06:32.700> and<00:06:32.820> has

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
but it's spinning throw it and has

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.250 
but it's spinning throw it and has
almost<00:06:33.390> a<00:06:33.540> gyro<00:06:33.840> effect<00:06:34.670> I'll<00:06:35.670> see<00:06:35.790> if<00:06:35.880> I<00:06:35.940> can

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
almost a gyro effect I'll see if I can

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.380 
almost a gyro effect I'll see if I can
hit<00:06:37.260> that<00:06:37.380> for<00:06:37.590> you<00:06:40.430> see<00:06:41.430> that<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:41.580> mean<00:06:41.730> see<00:06:42.330> how

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
hit that for you see that I mean see how

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.800 
hit that for you see that I mean see how
it<00:06:42.540> just<00:06:42.660> spun<00:06:43.020> out<00:06:43.230> of<00:06:43.320> control

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.410 

so<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:48.710> way<00:06:48.830> you<00:06:48.889> can<00:06:49.100> control<00:06:49.490> this<00:06:49.730> is<00:06:49.910> your

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
so the way you can control this is your

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.390 
so the way you can control this is your
trigger<00:06:50.660> finger<00:06:50.740> this<00:06:51.740> needs<00:06:51.920> to<00:06:51.950> be<00:06:52.040> stiffer

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
trigger finger this needs to be stiffer

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.740 
trigger finger this needs to be stiffer
and<00:06:52.670> it<00:06:52.730> needs<00:06:52.880> to<00:06:52.940> be<00:06:53.030> in<00:06:53.090> more<00:06:53.240> control<00:06:53.630> of

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
and it needs to be in more control of

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.930 
and it needs to be in more control of
the<00:06:53.870> night<00:06:54.050> because<00:06:54.800> fit<00:06:55.070> slips<00:06:55.340> off<00:06:55.550> to<00:06:55.790> one

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
the night because fit slips off to one

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.370 
the night because fit slips off to one
side<00:06:55.970> or<00:06:56.389> the<00:06:56.450> other<00:06:56.510> that's<00:06:56.960> what's<00:06:57.230> going<00:06:57.350> to

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
side or the other that's what's going to

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:07.060 
side or the other that's what's going to
cause<00:06:57.590> the<00:06:58.460> knife<00:06:58.639> to<00:06:58.910> bullet<00:06:59.360> spin

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070

alright that it's fun

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:17.149 
alright that it's fun

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:17.159 
bullets bond quite a bit so let's talk

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:24.890 
bullets bond quite a bit so let's talk
about<00:07:17.249> heavier<00:07:17.669> knife

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:39.469 

again<00:07:25.470> there's<00:07:25.680> still<00:07:25.770> a<00:07:25.890> lot<00:07:25.980> of<00:07:26.070> bolts<00:07:26.220> again
