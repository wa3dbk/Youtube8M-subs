Elaboration

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:49.555
Chop onions and eggplants in small pieces.

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:56.140
Put some oil in a pan and add the chopped onions

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.500
Once onions were tender, add eggplants

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.500
Move and add salt and pepper

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.500
Peel the shrimps and reserve their heads

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.770
Once pelled, chop them and and to onions and eggplant

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.900
In other pan add come oil and shrimp's heads.
SautÃ© and add some cognac

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.600
Cognac is to flambÃ©

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.640
Trick: Heat it before add

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.320
Once flambÃ©, add some stock and crush it

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.140
Strain and reserve

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.300
Add flour to the first pan (onion,eggplant and shrimps)

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.275
Fry it good and add the shrimp's heads stock

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:56.990
Mix and don't stop to move until get that uniform mass

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.890
Let the mass get cool, as much time as better to handle

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.715
Once cool, give it the croquettes shape

00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:13.170
Cover them with beaten egg and breadcrumbs

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.695

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.935
