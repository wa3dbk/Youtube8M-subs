00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
thing that stood out about the engine on

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
thing that stood out about the engine on
this<00:01:16.409> bike<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.159> had<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.610> smooth

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this bike was it had a really smooth

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.929 
this bike was it had a really smooth
power<00:01:18.299> delivery<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:19.049> whole<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.939> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
power delivery the whole way from the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.570 
power delivery the whole way from the
Ergo<00:01:21.299> side<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.930> things<00:01:22.259> I've<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:22.950> yes

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Ergo side of things I've got to say yes

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
Ergo side of things I've got to say yes
it's<00:01:23.850> brand<00:01:24.180> new<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.350> me<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.770> feels<00:01:26.040> like

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it's brand new but for me it feels like

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's brand new but for me it feels like
home<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.270> getting<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:27.689> my<00:01:27.900> 450

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
home because I'm just getting off my 450

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
home because I'm just getting off my 450
which<00:01:28.650> feels<00:01:28.920> exactly<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.490> same<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
which feels exactly the same as this I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
which feels exactly the same as this I
felt<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.259> move<00:01:31.409> around<00:01:31.710> really

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
felt like you can move around really

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
felt like you can move around really
easy<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.030> helped<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> switchback

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
easy it really helped in the switchback

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
easy it really helped in the switchback
corners<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.860> able<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> position<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.640> body

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
corners be able to position your body

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
corners be able to position your body
weight<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.270> exude<00:01:36.960> each<00:01:37.110> corner<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.720> brakes

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
weight to exude each corner the brakes

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.870 
weight to exude each corner the brakes
on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> new<00:01:40.439> bike<00:01:40.619> exactly<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.280> same<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.700> last

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
on the new bike exactly the same as last

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
on the new bike exactly the same as last
year's<00:01:42.299> Honda<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.990> known<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> good

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
year's Honda and known to have a good

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609 
year's Honda and known to have a good
strong<00:01:44.549> solid<00:01:44.610> brake<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.170> most<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
strong solid brake but just like most of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
strong solid brake but just like most of
the<00:01:46.740> other<00:01:46.890> manufacturers<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:48.119> really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the other manufacturers can really

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
the other manufacturers can really
benefit<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:48.930> working<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> slightly

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
benefit from working on a slightly

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.490 
benefit from working on a slightly
bigger<00:01:50.280> front<00:01:51.030> desk<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.600> think<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.079> sutiya

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
bigger front desk I think it was sutiya

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
bigger front desk I think it was sutiya
average<00:01:52.979> rider<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.490> they're<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.090> overly

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479

the<00:02:28.400> bike<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.030> has<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> fairly<00:02:29.690> flat<00:02:29.870> power

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
the bike is it has a fairly flat power

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.009 
the bike is it has a fairly flat power
curve<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.519> just<00:02:31.730> seems<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.060> just<00:02:32.299> die<00:02:32.750> off

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
curve and it just seems to just die off

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.990 
curve and it just seems to just die off
just<00:02:33.260> as<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.650> wanted<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.400> keep<00:02:34.580> pulling<00:02:34.819> a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
just as you wanted to keep pulling a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.690 
just as you wanted to keep pulling a
little<00:02:35.209> bit<00:02:35.299> harder<00:02:36.160> while<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> like<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.549> whole

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
little bit harder while I like the whole

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.309 
little bit harder while I like the whole
bike<00:02:37.970> pretty<00:02:38.239> much<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.780> only<00:02:38.870> thing<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.260> I

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
bike pretty much the only thing that I

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.500 
bike pretty much the only thing that I
don't<00:02:39.380> like<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.190> not<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.370> huge<00:02:40.819> fan<00:02:40.849> of<00:02:41.120> is

the<00:02:41.750> twin<00:02:42.019> exhaust<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.739> think<00:02:43.130> with<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
the twin exhaust but I think with the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.490 
the twin exhaust but I think with the
pro<00:02:43.580> circuit<00:02:43.849> for<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.569> carbon<00:02:44.959> tips<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.290> think

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
pro circuit for the carbon tips I think

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.589 
pro circuit for the carbon tips I think
it'll<00:02:45.620> look<00:02:45.739> smack<00:02:46.340> they<00:02:47.030> definitely<00:02:47.360> look
