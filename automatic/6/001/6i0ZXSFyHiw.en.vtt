00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.620
 in terms of market a very long distance 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.360
 large and for samsung and htc 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.430
 while the first practically 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.600
 achieved the supremacy in sales with the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.060
 your galaxy line 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.220
 the htc Taiwanese company is still a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.460
 unknown in Brazil and 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.460
 outdoor 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.540
 since the second half of last year 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.480
 htc has given up marketing its 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.489
 products in Brazil because of this 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.190
 despite the critical success in the press 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.320
 the htc one smartphone 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 released in February this year will never 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.460
 arrived in our stores 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.810
 we went outside to get a device 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.490
 for analysis to closely check all 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.440
 the potential of the smartphone 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.220
 the result of our evaluation is what 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.220
 you check now 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.320
 htc one design is undoubtedly one of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.689
 aspects that most attract the attention of the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.179
 lightweight product with first-class 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.820
 The model has curved sides slightly 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.250
 that make the footprint steady and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.729
 avoids slipping the back 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.709
 has rubber details 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.270
 already in the front the use of 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.819
 screen on the sides is extremely 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 satisfactory leaving room in the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:48.119
 down and top to the speakers to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.689
 htc one full hd screen has a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 pixel density of 469 pp and 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.289
 In addition, the company has 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.689
 left over to be proud 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.489
 htc one is a smartphone with the largest 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.509
 pixel density available in the 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.640
 Marketplace 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.489
 this image quality displayed on the screen 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.810
 with resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:12.180
 makes all the difference when it comes to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.000
 movies and games the displayed images 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
 perfect clarity and contrast and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.760
 the brightness settings still highlighted 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.220
 this feature already when the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.170
 subject is photography images even in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.630
 contrast and a certain level of 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.850
 noise has a significant gain when 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.190
 displayed on the device screen which is 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.280
 shadow of doubt the best ever tested 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.290
 by the technical dunga 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.019
 another great differential of htc one to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.750
 interface sense of the appliance 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.670
 android modification made by 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.250
 company has become one of its 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.500
 business cards and is not for less 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.819
 screen customization becomes practical 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.280
 and efficient 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.319
 the widgets provided follow a 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 style similar to that of the light rail 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.829
 windows phone 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.870
 so you can add information in 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.060
 small squares along the interface 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.569
 making content updates from 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.060
 even more accessible social networks 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.549
 there is practically no challenge that 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.500
 can be seen by htc one 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.130
 the quad core processor cualcomm 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.639
 garret snapdragon 601.7 is among the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.959
 most powerful available today 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.030
 its performance ensures that the device 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.699
 wheel smoothly any 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.709
 app available on google play at 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.639
 transition between screens is fluid and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.230
 locking 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.269
 in our tests 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.560
 are more than one task at a time 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.540
 at any moment left the system 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.790
 overloaded with the sensation of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.900
 slowness 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.830
 produced in partnership with renowned 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.290
 bits 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.629
 the htc one smartphone audio certainly 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.150
 is among the best on the market 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.099
 the distinction between bass and treble is 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.989
 clear when the sound is played 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.110
 in a high volume with the cell phone without 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.030
 headphones with headphones the situation 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.950
 It's no different and if you take in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.420
 regard to this characteristic before 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.579
 to purchase a very 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:11.190
 probably this model should stay in the 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:13.260
 top of their wish list is to 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.359
 wonder that a robust smartphone like 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.269
 htc the year present a rear camera 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.250
 only 4 megapixels when the average 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.720
 among top-of-the-line smartphones is in the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.669
 minimum or double 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.280
 although the quality of the images 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.229
 captured with it will still be acceptable 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.320
 is very little for what the product 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.600
 proposes to be in addition the screen with 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.310
 excellent pixel density 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.349
 cheat the consumer 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.479
 when viewing the image on the 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.820
 the sensation one has is that the 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.620
 color contrast is perfect but 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.810
 just move the images to the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.960
 computer to realize that in practice 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.000
 it's not quite what happens 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.950
 performance a high-end processor 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.840
 and above-average screen quality 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.020
 require a little more energy than 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.389
 other appliances 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.520
 however in the case of htc one the battery 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.139
 unfortunately does not keep pace with the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.680
 product crime launched by the company 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.680
 Taiwanese 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.090
 in our tests in moderate use the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.130
 was not very efficient with 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.940
 battery life below the 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.580
 average 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.980
 as it is not removable it means 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.750
 that when you buy this device you will have 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.970
 to walk with his loader around 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.810
 because the model hardly supports a 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.120
 whole day of use even in stand-by when 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.250
 consumption should be less Could 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.210
 check the battery being drained with 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.430
 faster with 3g or active wifi without 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.960
 doubt this is a requirement that deserved 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.460
 have received a little more attention 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.460
 by the company 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.790
 unfortunately htc one is not 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.150
 available in Brazil and there are no plans 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.280
 let it be sold here sometime 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.800
 however those who think import 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.840
 the product should be aware was enjoyed by 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.300
 one side it can even be considered 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.100
 one of the best on the market on the other 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.410
 limitations that prevent it from being 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.100
 used fully in the country 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.600
 is the case of compatibility with 4g a 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.850
 frequency of the standard 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.220
 different in terms of 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.169
 price on the international market the product 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.960
 positioning itself alongside models such as 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.060
 samsung galaxy s 4 and sony xperia z 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.350
 even to have advantages in 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.229
 some questions 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.870
 the high quality finishing the audio 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.539
 1st customization of the interface with the 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.370
 htc sense and mainly the density 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.470
 of pixels on the screen are the main 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.780
 product differentials 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.340
 however like every smartphone it 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.560
 also not perfect 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.639
 the battery leaves much to be desired and 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.249
 quality of the camera could be better 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.449
 complete analysis of the world and 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.449
 until our next video
