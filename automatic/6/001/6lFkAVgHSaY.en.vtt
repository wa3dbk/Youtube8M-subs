00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
be better than scar and I'm judging by

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.450 
be better than scar and I'm judging by
the<00:06:24.080> trailer<00:06:24.380> I<00:06:24.500> think<00:06:24.800> they<00:06:24.949> already<00:06:25.130> proved

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
the trailer I think they already proved

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.580 
the trailer I think they already proved
that<00:06:25.490> would<00:06:25.789> be<00:06:25.880> better<00:06:26.030> nascar<00:06:26.660> 09<00:06:26.810> but<00:06:27.349> we'll

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
that would be better nascar 09 but we'll

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.320 
that would be better nascar 09 but we'll
see<00:06:27.919> the<00:06:28.610> only<00:06:28.820> thing<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:29.330> i<00:06:31.150> hold<00:06:32.150> on<00:06:32.300> a

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
see the only thing that i hold on a

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.270 
see the only thing that i hold on a
second<00:06:32.800> sorry

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.040 

the<00:06:39.280> only<00:06:39.430> thing<00:06:39.610> I<00:06:39.639> hope<00:06:40.270> that<00:06:40.510> that<00:06:40.750> doesn't

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
the only thing I hope that that doesn't

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.590 
the only thing I hope that that doesn't
happen<00:06:41.380> is<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:42.280> cars<00:06:42.639> will<00:06:42.910> be<00:06:43.030> able<00:06:43.120> to<00:06:43.300> flip

sequence<00:07:14.230> of<00:07:14.380> buttons<00:07:14.560> and<00:07:15.400> if<00:07:15.520> you<00:07:15.640> messed<00:07:15.880> up

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
sequence of buttons and if you messed up

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.300 
sequence of buttons and if you messed up
about<00:07:16.180> you're<00:07:16.540> gonna<00:07:16.660> have<00:07:16.930> a<00:07:17.230> slower<00:07:17.620> stop<00:07:18.010> or

road so I think that'd be pretty cool oh

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.060 
road so I think that'd be pretty cool oh
yeah<00:07:25.030> they<00:07:25.180> also<00:07:25.330> have<00:07:25.720> a<00:07:25.750> when<00:07:26.560> you<00:07:26.650> when<00:07:26.890> you

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
yeah they also have a when you when you

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.100 
yeah they also have a when you when you
have<00:07:27.250> a<00:07:27.280> celebration<00:07:27.910> mode<00:07:28.300> so<00:07:28.720> that's

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 
far i think nascar 09 maybe nascar 2011

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.920 
far i think nascar 09 maybe nascar 2011
the<00:07:39.639> game<00:07:39.880> i<00:07:39.910> think<00:07:40.150> it<00:07:40.479> will<00:07:40.630> be<00:07:40.780> better

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930
