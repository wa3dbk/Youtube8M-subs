00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.060
 to start spring well I will 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.190
 offers this fresh look with a touching 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.190
 years that I realized with the mega 3 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.680
 for books to be perfect at 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.660
 time to make them up we put the leap 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.669
 forward is started and now 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.650
 it's ok we go with the eyes once 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.540
 pop reitz and eyelids included 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:36.460
 we apply the lighthouse bernardes on any 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:39.149
 the upper eyelid the arch and on 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 the entire lower eyelid 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.289
 then we fade slightly to see them 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.030
 with a rounded brush I like 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.180
 whoever was managing clap for help as she 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.589
 is very practical and easy to clean 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.539
 the result we will go to work in 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.250
 two stages with the same pension after 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.079
 to have it cleaned at but the strong factor 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.280
 is sure half is about the eyelid 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.280
 superior and sharks 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 stamp the edges 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.299
 and we apply again the same 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.619
 strong to intensify the facts 1 2 times 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.210
 we're doing it's 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.189
 much simpler to succeed both 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.170
 serious and we fade again 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.700
 with the round brush of the palette and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.780
 then we remove the excess with a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.729
 brush completely clean we are miss 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.329
 preferred illuminator is thereof the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.950
 bnf 8 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.899
 I like to apply it directly above 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.500
 eyebrows they do with the rest 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.500
 with your fingertips 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.780
 then a touch in the corner of 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.220
 eye finally sublimate them 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.599
 to intensify the source bass they 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.649
 have made a downtown feature at 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:50.579
 eyelids see outside and one fills 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.579
 all the inside of the eye 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.830
 now the bull eyebrows with a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.420
 lighthouse or eyebrow pencil filled 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.590
 the others provided me in my case 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.130
 those who are placed the party 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130
 higher 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.770
 once filled we brush them with a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.600
 fixator so that he informs hawtin 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:33.070
 perfectly so that the eyelashes and their 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.070
 longer the stop-court 20 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.320
 but the mascara by insisting the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.320
 root to raise them 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.650
 it is also applied on the islands in 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.910
 fur to open the eyes six 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.860
 in our home just remove 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.960
 the excess with the finger a I almost 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.940
 forget about the central and the eyelid 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.890
 puts a touch of low makeup normally 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.480
 the but before the mascara but it has me 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.840
 escaped when I recorded the same 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.910
 cape 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.500
 to finish off we remove the wind is a 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.910
 sir that we prefer to go but 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.500
 strings he's too good 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.890

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:48.690
