00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
looks largely original and unrestored

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.760 
looks largely original and unrestored
but<00:01:10.979> everything<00:01:11.430> seems<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.770> you

but everything seems to be here and you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.990 
but everything seems to be here and you
know<00:01:13.800> it's<00:01:14.070> got<00:01:14.220> quite<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.730> interesting

interior<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.830> say<00:01:17.010> it<00:01:17.190> looks<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:17.790> much

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
interior I would say it looks very much

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.390 
interior I would say it looks very much
apropos<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.770> period

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
apropos of the period

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
apropos of the period
all<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.000> switch<00:01:21.270> gear<00:01:21.540> appears<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:22.080> be

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
all the switch gear appears to be

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.490 
all the switch gear appears to be
present<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.700> door<00:01:24.630> fittings<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
present all of the door fittings and the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.500 
present all of the door fittings and the
window<00:01:26.010> winders<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.730> everything<00:01:27.120> seems<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
window winders and everything seems to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.880 
window winders and everything seems to
be<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:28.610> unrestored<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.940> it's<00:01:30.330> all<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
be in unrestored but it's all there so I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.030 
be in unrestored but it's all there so I
think<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> car<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.910> a

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
think this is the kind of car that a

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
think this is the kind of car that a
collector<00:01:35.040> would<00:01:35.670> treasure<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.330> car<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
collector would treasure a car like this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.550 
collector would treasure a car like this
actually<00:01:37.380> sold<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.240> $60,000<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.260> Gooding

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.060 
auction in Monterey in August of 2010
and<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.900> this<00:01:46.080> particular<00:01:46.260> car<00:01:46.800> has<00:01:46.830> a

once<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.310> car<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.850> me<00:02:24.030> seems<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.630> an

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
once so this car to me seems like an

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.310 
once so this car to me seems like an
easy<00:02:25.880> fixer<00:02:26.880> because<00:02:27.270> all<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.660> parts<00:02:28.020> are<00:02:28.140> so

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
easy fixer because all the parts are so

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.770 
easy fixer because all the parts are so
accessible<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.490> they're<00:02:30.090> probably<00:02:30.330> quite

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
accessible and they're probably quite

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.780 
accessible and they're probably quite
like<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.170> whole<00:02:31.350> car<00:02:31.590> weighs<00:02:31.800> 2,000<00:02:32.460> pounds

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
like the whole car weighs 2,000 pounds

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.600 
like the whole car weighs 2,000 pounds
so<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> looks<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.080> some
