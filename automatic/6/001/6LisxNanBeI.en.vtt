00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.310 

we<00:01:58.680> will<00:01:58.799> medal<00:01:59.600> stand<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
we will medal stand this kind of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.789 
we will medal stand this kind of
vibration<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> engineers<00:02:03.799> realized

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
vibration have the engineers realized

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.540 
vibration have the engineers realized
how<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.400> thing<00:02:05.640> shakes<00:02:05.940> because<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.540> shakes

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
how this thing shakes because it shakes

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:32.809 
how this thing shakes because it shakes
so<00:02:08.550> much<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:09.179> than<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.750> ever<00:02:09.780> imagined<00:02:31.819> shakes

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
so much more than I ever imagined shakes

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.670 
so much more than I ever imagined shakes
the<00:02:33.060> whole<00:02:33.180> body<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.810> reverberations<00:02:34.590> from

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the whole body the reverberations from

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.290 
the whole body the reverberations from
it<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.100> very<00:02:35.400> much<00:02:38.600> just<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:40.880> lot<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.030> people

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
it is very much just a lot of people

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.550 
it is very much just a lot of people
think<00:02:42.569> you're<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.930> lying<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.290> your<00:02:43.319> back

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
think you're just lying on your back

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.040 
think you're just lying on your back
waiting<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.370> happen<00:02:44.610> but<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:45.660> really

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
waiting for it to happen but not really

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.190 
waiting for it to happen but not really
because<00:02:46.590> every<00:02:47.220> second<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:48.049> something<00:02:49.049> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
because every second is something of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.410 
because every second is something of
significance<00:02:52.459> from<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.640> flight<00:02:53.880> surgeon

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
significance from the flight surgeon

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
significance from the flight surgeon
later<00:02:54.630> on<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.230> my<00:02:55.410> heartbeat<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> hundred

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
later on that my heartbeat was a hundred

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:06.530 
later on that my heartbeat was a hundred
and<00:02:56.880> forty-four<00:02:58.160> at<00:02:59.160> liftoff<00:03:03.739> yeah<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:06.209> said

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and forty-four at liftoff yeah I said

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.080 
and forty-four at liftoff yeah I said
mine<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.810> too<00:03:07.110> old<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.380> go<00:03:07.530> any<00:03:07.709> faster<00:03:10.910> why<00:03:11.910> did

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
mine is too old to go any faster why did

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.080 
mine is too old to go any faster why did
we<00:03:12.209> do<00:03:12.359> all<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.780> launch<00:03:13.140> simulation<00:03:14.100> if<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.910> had

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
we do all the launch simulation if I had

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.759 
we do all the launch simulation if I had
had<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.390> reach<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.750> switch<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.320> all<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.650> that

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
had to reach a switch with all of that

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.560 
had to reach a switch with all of that
vibration<00:03:16.980> point<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> wouldn't<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.329> quite

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
vibration point on I wouldn't have quite

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.970 
vibration point on I wouldn't have quite
been<00:03:18.840> sure<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.560> where<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.769> was<00:03:20.040> putting<00:03:20.220> my<00:03:20.519> hand

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.880 

we<00:03:27.459> were<00:03:27.700> on<00:03:28.090> our<00:03:28.420> way<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:31.170> had<00:03:32.170> control<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.800> that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
we were on our way I had control of that

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.330 
we were on our way I had control of that
vehicle<00:03:33.220> right<00:03:33.489> in<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.910> palm<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.300> my<00:03:34.330> hand<00:03:35.340> but

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
vehicle right in the palm of my hand but

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.920 
vehicle right in the palm of my hand but
the<00:03:36.519> guidance<00:03:36.910> failed<00:03:37.239> our<00:03:37.510> starting<00:03:37.870> to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the guidance failed our starting to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.570 
the guidance failed our starting to
destroy<00:03:38.080> her<00:03:38.470> went<00:03:38.739> somewhere<00:03:39.099> we<00:03:39.310> didn't

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
destroy her went somewhere we didn't

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.640 
destroy her went somewhere we didn't
like<00:03:39.760> her<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.030> ground<00:03:40.239> in<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.629> I<00:03:40.900> could<00:03:41.379> flip

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
like her to ground in like I could flip

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.800 
like her to ground in like I could flip
a<00:03:41.680> switch
