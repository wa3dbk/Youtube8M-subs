00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 Hello, I am Alexey, two words 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 air absorber what it is and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 how to pump it up 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 Firstly in order to pump back 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 shock absorber 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.560
 here circle is a must pump 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 high pressure 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.529
 there is here a byte of wine in before the boiler is not 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.210
 sold foot pump 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.600
 usual and there is a pump in my opinion it is not up to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 Neva ’s high-pressure pump 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.820
 they have a fundamental difference 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.219
 this pump maximum pressure 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.850
 which he stand can give it away 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.660
 5 half atmospheres at this pump 11 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.090
 from Moscow that is in the shock absorber can 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.719
 be back depending on your weight 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.410
 from six atmospheres to eleven 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.300
 atmospheres 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 Again, you need to take into account more weather 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.400
 conditions because we remember that on 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 in the cold the air shrinks and in the heat it 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.729
 expands that's why if you 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.770
 pump shock absorber and lie sofa 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.869
 April in the sun you break my 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 the camera is very carefully inside 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 air pump there is a camera which 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.600
 rips if there is too much air 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 consider that I pumped up to 8 atmospheres 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 This March issue question is suitable 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 I give it ninety kilograms 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.790
 how to check on each shock absorber 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.500
 There is such a rezinochka she mobile 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.079
 completely free we slip it from 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.930
 the lowest position move to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.090
 uppermost under the stop 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.860
 so fine now we sit down 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 bike but do not jump sit down 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.939
 neatly full weight to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.990
 push get up and get up and sela 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.630
 we remove the legs 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.220
 We get up pay attention that rezinochka 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.039
 she sank to a certain 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.250
 provisions is that 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.530
 is comfortable for you here if 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.430
 rezinochka squander more than 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.680
 third of the total stroke length means you 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.630
 weakly pumped shock absorber 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.450
 if the rubber is under your weight 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.870
 practically does not squander not 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.799
 squander less than the thickness 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.569
 finger finger's breadth it's too bad 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.090
 I advise you to lower a little bit of pressure 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.030
 optimal pressure for my 90 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.130
 kilogram further you can already set up 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.920
 need as far as you rebound 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.860
 rebound speeds but the fact is because 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.510
 that when you will amortize yes you 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.849
 you will sink further but if you don’t 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.130
 that is, if at that moment when you 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.650
 sit at your rezinochka not sags 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.349
 then the shock absorber will not work here 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.250
 so far all I want to say about air 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.370
 shock absorber 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.280
 I tell Alexey to my friends 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.890
 dogs dogs you do not like set 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.359
 likes tell friends to subscribe 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.810
 on the channel to new meetings 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.810
