of the camera's microphone so let's get
started<00:00:37.020> by<00:00:37.520> hitting<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> record<00:00:38.880> button<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
started by hitting the record button and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
started by hitting the record button and
giving<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.380> couple<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.829> seconds<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.540> quietness

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:14.200 

now<00:00:55.510> let's<00:00:55.810> give<00:00:55.990> some<00:00:56.230> fan<00:00:56.590> of<00:00:56.830> noise<00:00:57.040> at<00:00:57.580> full

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.690 

so<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.600> fair<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.830> without<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so that is fair to say that without the

so that is fair to say that without the
wind<00:01:18.090> noise<00:01:18.270> filter<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.890> should<00:01:20.159> hear

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
wind noise filter on you should hear

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.800 
wind noise filter on you should hear

but missing perfect microphone so what I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.380 
but missing perfect microphone so what I
have<00:01:45.720> come<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.050> with<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.800> be<00:01:47.149> let's<00:01:48.149> say

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
have come up with will be let's say

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.440 
have come up with will be let's say
we're<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> take<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.080> piece<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.450> tissue

is<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.179> simple<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.720> modify<00:02:00.649> but<00:02:01.649> who<00:02:01.770> wants

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
is very simple to modify but who wants

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.380 
is very simple to modify but who wants
to<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.940> piece<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.479> tape<00:02:03.690> on<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:03.990> cam<00:02:05.390> well

that's up to you I fold it a couple of
times<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> when<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.500> correctly<00:02:14.069> on

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
times and when I get it correctly on

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.840 
times and when I get it correctly on
there

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
there

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.150 
there
I<00:02:14.880> will<00:02:15.269> then<00:02:15.540> modify<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.830> correct<00:02:17.220> way<00:02:19.160> it's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
I will then modify the correct way it's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.880 
I will then modify the correct way it's
that<00:02:20.430> simple<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.239> your<00:02:21.720> modification<00:02:22.650> just

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that simple to do your modification just

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.490 
that simple to do your modification just
like<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.810> would<00:02:25.019> give<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> idea

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
like that this would give you the idea

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.810 
like that this would give you the idea
of<00:02:26.250> wind<00:02:27.060> blowing<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> camera<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
of wind blowing in it to the camera so

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.180 
of wind blowing in it to the camera so
let's<00:02:29.970> hit<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.329> record<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:34.320> hear<00:02:34.560> me<00:02:34.709> talking

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.119 

with<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.439> wind<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.040> be<00:02:45.519> talking<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.920> there

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
with the wind and be talking so there

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.509 
with the wind and be talking so there
you<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.709> something<00:02:50.709> very<00:02:50.739> simple<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.939> do

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
you have it something very simple to do

the next test is placing a professional
piece<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.569> foam<00:02:58.900> over<00:02:59.290> the<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:01.239> top<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.870> don't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
piece of foam over the the top I don't

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.610 
piece of foam over the the top I don't
want<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:02.860> cut<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.220> at<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.579> moment<00:03:03.879> because<00:03:04.659> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
want to cut it at this moment because it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.539 
want to cut it at this moment because it
may<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:06.190> may<00:03:06.340> not<00:03:06.519> work<00:03:08.700> let's<00:03:09.700> turn<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:11.549> you
