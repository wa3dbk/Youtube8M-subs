00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.049
 Y 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 live 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.430
 friends between average as they are I am 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.310
 you know that and here we are seeing two the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.160
 most important teams this year by 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.920
 one side we see the samsung galaxy s 4 and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.920
 on the other hand the xperia z 1 these two 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.130
 equipment already with powerful cameras 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.290
 powerful photographic screens we see 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.870
 both in terms of size where yes 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.680
 there really is a very very difference 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.620
 important with respect to xperia z 1 is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.530
 a phone that does not yet enter 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.140
 the size of the fab let's if it's a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.170
 much bigger team the truth is that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.380
 you can see the actual size of 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.930
 screen and is slightly larger not 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.159
 there is not much difference what we see 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.409
 of larger size is the equipment itself 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.050
 let's see how obviously it is great in 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.200
 how much along the team and also 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.350
 to the thickness of it you can see 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.620
 this comparative and see how there is a 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.810
 important difference of sizes 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.910
 another side we will see also the part 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.910
 of thickness you can see 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.840
 as it is almost the same size but what 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.759
 that yes is a fact is that the finishes 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.800
 of the xperia z 1 are much finer here 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.190
 we see a finish 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.880
 let's say you can finish piano 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.010
 and what is here with regard to the use of equipment 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.100
 If you have a lot of fat in the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.380
 you can see it here on samsung 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.420
 has this detail the line of samsung 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.910
 you see equipment that although they can be 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.600
 more confident in the end the opinion is that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.790
 they look a lot more plastic here we see 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.579
 also what 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.010
 the camera is located at this point 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.019
 photographic you can see them are 20 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.930
 megapixels against the samsung 13 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.390
 galaxy s 4 finally we have here the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.290
 front camera also located almost at 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.280
 center right next to the logo of 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.800
 sony and here we see it in this case a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.980
 little more in the part 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.120
 let's say almost but in the corner too 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.250
 pulling a little is the center here there 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 some sensors that prevent the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.050
 front camera is much more centered 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.920
 the truth is that if I can not be in 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.300
 this moment that if there is a difference 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.870
 remarkable in terms of the screen but if 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.700
 you see maybe a little more contrast of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.350
 the quality of the images 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 we would have to compare two videos of 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.680
 same type to be able to make a 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.890
 opinion about it but good so 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.890
 soon here you can physically see 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.340
 this comparative of both teams the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.340
 samsung galaxy s 4 and the xperia z 1
