was very good I was of two minds about

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.230 
was very good I was of two minds about
the<00:06:15.710> movements<00:06:16.490> because<00:06:16.850> it<00:06:16.970> felt<00:06:17.180> like

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
the movements because it felt like

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.520 
the movements because it felt like

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
but sometimes it look like you were

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.940 
but sometimes it look like you were
thinking<00:06:20.840> through<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.230> moves<00:06:21.440> you're<00:06:21.650> doing
