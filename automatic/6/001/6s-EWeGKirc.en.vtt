this<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.190> twisting<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
this it's just going to be twisting and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
this it's just going to be twisting and
go<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.329> gonna<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> pull<00:00:57.870> start<00:00:58.140> on

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
go you're gonna have a pull start on

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.639 
go you're gonna have a pull start on
your<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.920> side<00:00:59.600> I've<00:01:00.600> ran<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.289> in

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
your right side I've ran this in

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
your right side I've ran this in
30-degree<00:01:02.520> weather<00:01:02.699> before<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
30-degree weather before and with a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.649 
30-degree weather before and with a
choke<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.680> second<00:01:05.460> pull<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.939> most<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.450> lot<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
choke on second pull at most a lot of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
choke on second pull at most a lot of
times<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> fired<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.280> first

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
times they can get it fired on the first

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.170 
times they can get it fired on the first
pole<00:01:09.049> no<00:01:10.049> matter<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.729> now<00:01:11.729> nice<00:01:11.970> thing<00:01:12.119> about

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pole no matter what now nice thing about

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
pole no matter what now nice thing about
4<00:01:12.540> strokes<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.409> quiet<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
4 strokes they are going to be quiet and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
4 strokes they are going to be quiet and
they're<00:01:14.460> also<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.299> clean<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.590> no

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
they're also going to be clean so no

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520 
they're also going to be clean so no
smoke<00:01:17.159> coming<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.869> efficient

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
smoke coming out of them very efficient

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.730 
smoke coming out of them very efficient
quiet<00:01:20.479> just<00:01:21.479> an<00:01:21.600> all-around<00:01:21.930> great<00:01:22.290> engine

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
quiet just an all-around great engine

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
quiet just an all-around great engine
straight<00:01:23.040> gas<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> no<00:01:23.850> mixing<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> worrying

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
straight gas so no mixing and worrying

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
straight gas so no mixing and worrying
about<00:01:24.900> ratios<00:01:25.350> anything<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> like

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
about ratios anything like that like

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120 
about ratios anything like that like
with<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> two-stroke<00:01:27.200> no<00:01:28.200> clutch<00:01:28.530> lever<00:01:28.860> just

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
with a two-stroke no clutch lever just

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.929 
with a two-stroke no clutch lever just
pull<00:01:29.820> let<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> warm<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.820> twist<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
pull let it warm up and twist the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.300 
pull let it warm up and twist the
throttle<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.710> one<00:01:34.710> thing<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> four

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
throttle and go one thing about the four

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.350 
throttle and go one thing about the four
strokes<00:01:35.579> you're<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> notice<00:01:36.090> you're

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
strokes you're going to notice you're

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
strokes you're going to notice you're
going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> lot<00:01:37.079> bigger<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
going to be a lot bigger than a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
going to be a lot bigger than a
two-stroke<00:01:38.520> engine<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.329> looking<00:01:39.720> down<00:01:39.930> here

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
two-stroke engine so looking down here

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.249 
two-stroke engine so looking down here
it<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.549> gonna<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.090> wide<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it is gonna be pretty wide it's going to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.980 
it is gonna be pretty wide it's going to
take<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.560> quite<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.070> space<00:01:44.600> also<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
take up quite a bit of space also on the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.399 
take up quite a bit of space also on the
length<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.710> height<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.720> with

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
length and height so much so that with

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.200 
length and height so much so that with
the<00:01:49.560> four-stroke<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the four-stroke it's you are going to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
the four-stroke it's you are going to
get<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> widen<00:01:51.960> crank<00:01:52.320> set<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> see

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
get a widen crank set and kind of see

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.440 
get a widen crank set and kind of see
there<00:01:54.180> how<00:01:54.479> wide<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> cranks<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.470> plus<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
there how wide the cranks are plus the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.620 
there how wide the cranks are plus the
arms<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> pedals<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.320> also<00:01:59.240> molded<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
arms for the pedals are also molded to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
arms for the pedals are also molded to
be<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.350> bit<00:02:01.469> wider<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.159> pedal

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
be a little bit wider so you can pedal

be a little bit wider so you can pedal
and<00:02:02.790> clear<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> engine

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.270 

kind<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.539> try<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:07.990> best<00:02:08.649> few<00:02:08.979> here<00:02:09.250> so

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
kind of try and get the best few here so

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.589 
kind of try and get the best few here so
you<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.670> see<00:02:09.819> what<00:02:09.910> I'm<00:02:09.970> talking<00:02:10.030> about

the way but I can't explain the
differences<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.379> first<00:02:47.769> thing<00:02:48.040> starting

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
differences to you first thing starting

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.800 
differences to you first thing starting
you're<00:02:48.849> not<00:02:49.000> gonna<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.299> pull<00:02:49.540> start

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
you're not gonna have a pull start

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.690 
you're not gonna have a pull start
you're<00:02:50.530> gonna<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.799> clutch<00:02:51.010> lever<00:02:51.310> you're

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
you're gonna have a clutch lever you're

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.880 
you're gonna have a clutch lever you're
going<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.879> pedal<00:02:52.209> up<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.450> speed<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.019> then<00:02:53.470> pop

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
going to pedal up to speed and then pop

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.530 
going to pedal up to speed and then pop
the<00:02:54.069> clutch<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.549> that's<00:02:54.879> how<00:02:55.120> your<00:02:55.239> engine<00:02:55.450> is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the clutch and that's how your engine is

going to have mix gas so if you do pull

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.830 
going to have mix gas so if you do pull
up<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> gas<00:03:00.879> station<00:03:00.910> you're<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.690> want

up to a gas station you're going to want

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.900 
up to a gas station you're going to want
to<00:03:01.870> buy<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.109> oil<00:03:02.379> there<00:03:02.680> or<00:03:02.920> keep<00:03:03.250> oil<00:03:03.459> with

another<00:03:39.669> thing<00:03:39.880> about<00:03:39.910> them<00:03:40.299> granted<00:03:40.630> they

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
another thing about them granted they

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.370 
another thing about them granted they
are<00:03:40.840> smaller<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.620> have<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.799> wider<00:03:42.099> range<00:03:42.250> of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
are smaller so you have a wider range of

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.099 
are smaller so you have a wider range of
frames<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.650> can<00:03:44.799> fit<00:03:45.099> them<00:03:45.190> in<00:03:45.630> even<00:03:46.630> on<00:03:46.900> the

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
frames you can fit them in even on the

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.750 
frames you can fit them in even on the
beach<00:03:47.290> cruisers<00:03:47.739> here<00:03:48.010> or<00:03:48.160> any<00:03:48.340> other<00:03:48.519> bike

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
beach cruisers here or any other bike

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.280 
beach cruisers here or any other bike
they're<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.299> small<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.989> don't<00:03:50.169> even

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
they're so small that you don't even

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.849 
they're so small that you don't even
need<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.769> wide<00:03:51.010> crank<00:03:51.519> set<00:03:51.790> on<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.680> do

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
need the wide crank set on it so you do

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.530 
need the wide crank set on it so you do
have<00:03:53.980> more<00:03:54.130> options<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.730> way<00:03:54.940> however<00:03:55.209> two

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
have more options that way however two

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.539 
have more options that way however two
strokes<00:03:55.840> are<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.049> lot<00:03:56.200> noisier<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:57.099> they're

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
strokes are a lot noisier and they're

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.220 
strokes are a lot noisier and they're
also<00:03:57.700> going<00:03:57.849> to<00:03:57.910> be<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.030> lot<00:03:58.209> dirtier<00:03:58.510> so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
also going to be a lot dirtier so

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.509 
also going to be a lot dirtier so
they're<00:03:59.349> going<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.560> smoke<00:03:59.829> because<00:04:00.099> of<00:04:00.430> that

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
they're going to smoke because of that

they're going to smoke because of that

oil mixed in with the gas so something

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.400 
oil mixed in with the gas so something

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
kind of keep in mind there they are

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.839 
kind of keep in mind there they are
going<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.829> little<00:04:05.950> bit<00:04:06.099> more<00:04:06.250> torquey<00:04:06.730> on

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
going to be a little bit more torquey on

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.300 
going to be a little bit more torquey on
a<00:04:06.879> office<00:04:07.870> start<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:08.410> they're<00:04:08.709> also<00:04:08.859> going<00:04:09.220> to

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
a office start and they're also going to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.330 
a office start and they're also going to
be<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.430> little<00:04:09.579> bit<00:04:09.730> faster<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.389> top-end

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
be a little bit faster on the top-end

matter<00:04:14.049> how<00:04:14.350> much<00:04:14.620> you

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
matter how much you

matter how much you
what<00:04:17.289> kind<00:04:17.439> of<00:04:17.470> two-stroke<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.039> have<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:19.030> can

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
what kind of two-stroke you have you can

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.170 
what kind of two-stroke you have you can
only<00:04:19.299> do<00:04:19.539> so<00:04:19.870> much<00:04:19.930> with<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:21.069> gearing<00:04:21.430> when

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
only do so much with the gearing when

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.779 
only do so much with the gearing when
you<00:04:22.240> start<00:04:22.539> getting<00:04:22.629> into<00:04:23.639> changing<00:04:24.639> the

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
you start getting into changing the

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.640 
you start getting into changing the
sprocket<00:04:25.479> sizes<00:04:26.020> or<00:04:27.300> even<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.360> shift<00:04:28.659> kit<00:04:28.900> then

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
sprocket sizes or even a shift kit then

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.529 
sprocket sizes or even a shift kit then
you<00:04:29.770> can<00:04:29.949> get<00:04:30.129> your<00:04:30.310> higher<00:04:30.580> speeds<00:04:31.060> better

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
you can get your higher speeds better

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.450 
you can get your higher speeds better
torque<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.590> can<00:04:32.710> even<00:04:32.830> accomplish<00:04:33.310> that

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
torque and you can even accomplish that

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.909 
torque and you can even accomplish that
with<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.639> four<00:04:33.909> stroke<00:04:34.349> two<00:04:35.349> strokes<00:04:35.379> are<00:04:35.770> going

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
with a four stroke two strokes are going

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.129 
with a four stroke two strokes are going
to<00:04:35.979> have<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.189> edge<00:04:36.340> on<00:04:36.659> modifications<00:04:37.659> you

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
to have the edge on modifications you

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.800 
to have the edge on modifications you
can<00:04:38.439> do<00:04:38.759> endless<00:04:39.759> endless<00:04:40.000> amounts<00:04:40.659> of

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
can do endless endless amounts of

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.020 
can do endless endless amounts of
upgrades<00:04:41.469> to<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.740> two-stroke<00:04:42.250> engine<00:04:42.699> as<00:04:42.849> far

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
upgrades to a two-stroke engine as far

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.140 
upgrades to a two-stroke engine as far
as<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.240> heads<00:04:43.539> and<00:04:44.340> Reed<00:04:45.340> valves<00:04:45.789> things<00:04:45.969> like

as the heads and Reed valves things like

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.740 
as the heads and Reed valves things like
that<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:47.259> where<00:04:47.379> you<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.680> really<00:04:48.389> modify<00:04:49.389> and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
that to where you can really modify and

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.209 
that to where you can really modify and
get<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> lot<00:04:50.169> more<00:04:50.409> power<00:04:50.650> than<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:51.009> stock

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
get a lot more power than a stock

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.089 
get a lot more power than a stock
two-stroke<00:04:54.870> kath<00:04:55.870> cost<00:04:56.229> also<00:04:56.710> you're<00:04:57.009> gonna

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
two-stroke kath cost also you're gonna

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.249 
two-stroke kath cost also you're gonna
pay<00:04:57.699> about<00:04:58.150> double<00:04:58.690> depending<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.110> what

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
pay about double depending on what

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.980 
pay about double depending on what
four-stroke<00:04:59.889> you're<00:05:00.039> going<00:05:00.460> for<00:05:00.840> this<00:05:01.840> is

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
four-stroke you're going for this is

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.760 
four-stroke you're going for this is
just<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.259> HS<00:05:02.680> model<00:05:03.659> just<00:05:04.659> a<00:05:04.750> Chinese<00:05:05.349> import

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
just the HS model just a Chinese import

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.619 
just the HS model just a Chinese import
model<00:05:06.159> you<00:05:06.370> can<00:05:06.639> go<00:05:06.819> up<00:05:06.909> to<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.120> Honda's

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
model you can go up to the Honda's

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.029 
model you can go up to the Honda's
they're<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.840> lot<00:05:07.990> more<00:05:08.169> expensive<00:05:08.469> but<00:05:08.889> your

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
they're a lot more expensive but your

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.119 
they're a lot more expensive but your
reliability<00:05:09.699> is<00:05:10.029> a<00:05:10.060> lot<00:05:10.270> better<00:05:10.479> with<00:05:10.629> those

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
reliability is a lot better with those

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.589 
reliability is a lot better with those
now<00:05:12.129> the<00:05:12.190> thing<00:05:12.430> with<00:05:12.550> four-strokes<00:05:13.150> they<00:05:13.509> are

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
now the thing with four-strokes they are

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.179 
now the thing with four-strokes they are
going<00:05:13.719> to<00:05:13.779> be<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.930> lot<00:05:14.050> more<00:05:14.080> reliable<00:05:14.590> they're

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:15.189 
going to be a lot more reliable they're

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379

I haven't really read much from anyone
that<00:05:35.409> gets<00:05:35.770> more<00:05:35.949> than<00:05:36.069> about<00:05:36.190> five<00:05:36.250> thousand

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
that gets more than about five thousand
