00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.890
 I hope you are very well we are not going to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.210
 talk about 12 key pieces that I consider 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.740
 for this season for this summer 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.000
 basically I based myself on what I've 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.110
 seen in stores but I see that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.110
 predominates let's start 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.570
 let's start with the Navajo style 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.920
 that we have seen it throughout 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.600
 winter and that continues during the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.760
 summer the typical features of the style 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.710
 Navajo you will know them a lot of drawing 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.869
 geometric fringes etc. we can 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.610
 see from the poncho are jerseys even 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.560
 also in accessories as you have 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.720
 chosen this jersey that arises that style 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.120
 poncho bis here 16 details as of 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.290
 fringes and then the geometry of the drawing 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.379
 which is in the front and 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.379
 rear 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.650
 there is a key piece would be what 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.660
 we call monolith that is a piece of 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.760
 one piece to say it some way 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.740
 in this case you see that chosen a style 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.540
 asymmetric and a tips would give in this 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.280
 case when you decide to wear clothes 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.510
 this style make sure to mark well the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 waist because I think it helps 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 very much to stylize the set and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.330
 especially lengthen the legs and then 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
 also in the case of being wide that 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.540
 they have baggy pants like those 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.460
 I have used flat shoe the third 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.080
 key piece would be a seasonal bag 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 eye-catching with a color so be 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.800
 rabid as I usually say 'the and that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 also have a considerable size not 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.160
 I know you but I in the summer 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.750
 carry more things inside the bag between 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.100
 they the water bottle that if the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.450
 sun cream that if the sunglasses 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.040
 amount more things with which 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.600
 we need the size to be more 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.600
 considerable than the classical class 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.680
 4 key element that would be the fringes 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 you can see the fringes in all 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.610
 parts applied to all types of garments 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 from jackets from jerseys skirts 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.150
 dressed whatever you already know that I in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 my day blog and cool how I applied three 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.690
 I have made two shirts and a skirt 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.190
 This is one of the skirts I designed in 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 one of my of cool and as you see 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.369
 combines in a very simple way to 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 that highlights the fringes another piece 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.700
 key are the openwork jerseys that have 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.810
 to be on average between cold and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.490
 heat that is what we need 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.960
 totally in the summer when by 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.070
 example the header makes it cooler 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.630
 in the north that usually do more 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 cool you put that kind of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.990
 exercises that neither shelter too much nor 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 they are too hot in this case it is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.110
 that chosen one of beige color that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.970
 like it a lot because it 's less spots or 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.619
 that the classic white that also looks 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.540
 a lot in stores and then also that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.370
 You know that I have acquired one who 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.830
 another in prettier colors of season 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 type then pink in orange to give it a 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.950
 little more life to the beige color of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.150
 combined with red color as you see in 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.800
 two tonalities on the one hand the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.630
 pant is a red plus not so 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.340
 vibrant and another part the little bag that is 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.810
 that has the classic red color and then 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.580
 some feet sandals because we are 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.900
 in summer and summer you have to take advantage 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.900
 to get the feet right on the air 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.040
 a key accessory would be the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.690
 sandals my color is how to apply the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.970
 blog color trend that we saw the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.080
 spring-summer past at the feet 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.280
 you will see how in the stores there is a 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.260
 heap of sandals that have two 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.030
 colors in case the ones I wear are 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.370
 black and green I've seen them in 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.349
 more summery colors like for example 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.569
 the purple and yellow oranges and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.670
 purple or strawberries are the numerations 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.470
 very broad then these sandals os 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.909
 allow combinations with colors 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.440
 of he wrote them to the sandal and with 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.329
 others that are complementary those 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.190
 colors with which they have infinity of 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.720
 possibilities a key garment is a 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.280
 seasonal coat there are also days of 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.510
 summer and spring those that are cold and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.680
 obviously we are not going to put 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.730
 winter coats for which 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.470
 we need to have a piece of clothing 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.670
 season that you have explained that 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.470
 example the raincoats work 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 phenomenal and in this case I've also 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.440
 made with this garment that I fell in love 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.150
 nothing else to see will launch and then what 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.349
 complemented with pastel colors 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.349
 also season 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.150
 another key element this season are 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.650
 the prints sing a new me 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.120
 Would you say that we can not sing? 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.800
 I'm good because there are the songs 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.050
 for those who want and more with shapes 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.670
 geometric floral patterns 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.470
 Chinese are a lot of things 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.000
 the famous pep look skirt that is that 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.980
 skirt that incorporates a kind of 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.050
 steering wheel from the waist to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.850
 down on top of the skirt itself as 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.320
 You see, they usually have a pencil type shape and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.320
 they incorporate it as I tell you those flyers 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.100
 Another key piece seems to me the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.990
 shorts but not necessarily 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.820
 Super short jeans style 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.950
 projects that we have seen no way to 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.570
 low shot such but the other way around 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.880
 pants that have certain tweezers or 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.080
 certain ways of dressing and that are not 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.210
 so tight to the legs but that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.799
 they have a little more flight another piece 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.150
 key are the pants a little bit more 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.739
 dresses are not necessarily 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.049
 trousers but they have 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.910
 a more arranged cut in this case like 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.710
 You see I have some that have a pattern 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.020
 pretty multicolored but they are characterized 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.730
 for not being too long or not 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.440
 usually end in a hem 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.850
 and then as I say in the part of 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.020
 up are very clean they do not usually 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.820
 carry pockets ie they are a 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.890
 pants very different from the cowboy and 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.570
 skinny that we are used to and has 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.090
 an air a little more formal and for 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.770
 last one could not miss the basic basic 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.140
 basic summer that is always in addition 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.700
 of this that is the white dress are 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.010
 more stores full of dressing something else 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.290
 an offer with one is impossible so 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.970
