00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.340
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:04.730
 well I hope you have gone from 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.979
 Happy Holidays 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.860
 I do not overeat a good year 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.840
 at the same time so today we're going 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.060
 start the year in with a good 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.510
 little video of bugs understand 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.330
 mastodon so here you drink you 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.110
 take the mp5 and on the wall you put 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.640
 in one corner of the map 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.690
 when I say in one corner of the map does 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.400
 you can really put yourself 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.560
 anywhere we got here because 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.180
 it's really easy to achieve 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.430
 the bug so I'm going to explain to you there and 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.780
 my buddy my roommate neither afraid to 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.219
 the time of folding and it pays the pots 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.230
 of pay because it's my friends who 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.280
 are on call I was kidding or since 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.390
 a long time or so I know no more 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 a long time and I call them the mates of 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.460
 pay so here is my buddy plyce 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.649
 9:59 am who is in the corner he has a 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.479
 centex hand accurate although it is 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.019
 a this tax because here it's hard to 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.609
 tell if the text 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.129
 I'm saying that's because it's a 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.979
 centex and it's not a grenade launched 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.030
 since if it's a grenade a frag 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.889
 exposing yourself in the hand we will you the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.449
 take the text scene and you do it 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.769
 not you put one in a corner of the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.440
 map and watch you on the ground 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.509
 alas as you see did not perceive 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.090
 affected waris takes one or two slaps 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.009
 from time to time but knows nothing 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.719
 here he is dead and so you 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.549
 take to semtex or so you take the 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.189
 mp5 in the hand you put in a 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.750
 corner of the map anywhere and you 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.920
 lower your head help the zombies go 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.560
 not your footsteps touching you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 so it's an inexplicable bug it's not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.240
 these snipers from elsewhere 59 who there he has 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.119
 found it's not me all the merit 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.969
 all the credit is so sweet to him 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.929
 found himself alone like that while playing 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.570
 I watched videos on youtube 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.130
 moreover it has no any who 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.859
 show that they show this bug so I 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.780
 believe that I am first to show it 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.999
 thank you in any case to snipe 59 my friend 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.189
 blaye who found her tell me 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.320
 that I found a bug mounts there on 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.960
 the on youtube is a video but there 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
 on youtube and that's how it is 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.109
 be hydrated the others so galley in fashion 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 zombies that will help you to go far 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.299
 that's the other one all zombies are 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.100
 attracted to him then we know but here 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.539
 because if instructed somewhere else there is 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.560
 too many zombies who come from 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.939
 anywhere then after that is 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.280
 anarchy and touch you all so 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.720
 that the sniper view 59 gets in the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.119
 corner hobbies are immediately drawn 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.090
 towards him 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.790
 suddenly suddenly 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.349
 we go down far what then there we did not 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.870
 not been far because we had good 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.610
 tired of the blow we stopped but me 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.610
 I was until the 28th round without doing 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.959
 accurate bugs that's where you put 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.640
 in the small corner you take the mp5 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.430
 you put in the little corner and you 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.420
 look down and if everything is simple 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.290
 you will take one or two 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.799
 slaps from time to time but these 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.180
 Syrian 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.069
 it's really nothing but simon chang 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.700
 is long as lava or change of 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.010
 clothes and it's not good 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.330
 there it all you if you take the little one 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 wine that you put in the corner and you 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.829
 go see you're finished you take 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.720
 the little guy the mp5 and that's the d23 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.260
 an estimate of next to me he does not touch 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.549
 and that's how we go far so I 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.880
 know it's cheating it's not good 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.579
 bad 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.110
 that said that but but I did 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.150
 a lot of zombies I have a little full 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.180
 of pretty studies and camp when we can 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.280
 find one or two bugs his raise a 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.739
 little game do you mean by that is a 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.140
 little idea to replay some hobbies 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.430
 otherwise good here I hope you 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.750
 go succeed way it's not complicated 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.690
 if you do not get to you are 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.700
 really really had to because it's a 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.870
 simple bug you put anywhere 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.310
 in the corner of the map must not they 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.590
 have a scene by ashes that blocks 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.049
 look good first and then you go 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.109
 far do you put there at worst the lah or 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.639
 sniper 59th but I put myself and there 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.049
 you go there you go away from against 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.400
 and I forgot to tell you if we have a 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.810
 dozen there he can touch you 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.829
 it really takes the goals and offered in 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.220
 measuring here I hope the video is going 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.349
 You lose 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.349
 and then she has very soon
