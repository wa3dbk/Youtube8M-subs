which is on a helicopter style
of<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> distant<00:01:33.330> lead<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:35.100> I've<00:01:35.190> done<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> I've

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
of a distant lead what I've done is I've

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.550 
of a distant lead what I've done is I've
chopped<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> swirl<00:01:36.210> off<00:01:36.330> just<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> make<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.440> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
chopped the swirl off just to make it a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.180 
chopped the swirl off just to make it a
bit<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:37.710> tired<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.280> compact<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
bit more tired here compact on to that

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.250 
bit more tired here compact on to that
I'm<00:01:41.850> using<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.360> new<00:01:42.510> quarter<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.530> trap<00:01:45.260> link

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
I'm using the new quarter and trap link

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.710 
I'm using the new quarter and trap link
so<00:01:46.950> again<00:01:47.250> being<00:01:47.790> using<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.150> one<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.450> very

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
so again being using it one out very

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.109 
so again being using it one out very
good<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> important<00:01:50.880> things<00:01:51.060> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
good but one of the important things for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.290 
good but one of the important things for
long-range<00:01:51.360> casting<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.140> people<00:01:52.500> neglect

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
long-range casting that people neglect

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.260 
long-range casting that people neglect
is<00:01:54.300> what<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.900> they<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> great<00:01:55.590> big

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
is what they do is they put a great big

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
is what they do is they put a great big
bottom<00:01:57.270> bite<00:01:57.479> pop-up<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> expect<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.800> cast

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
bottom bite pop-up on and expect to cast

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.670 
bottom bite pop-up on and expect to cast
massive<00:01:59.520> distances<00:02:00.050> as<00:02:01.050> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.440> there

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
massive distances as you can see there

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
massive distances as you can see there
what<00:02:02.070> I've<00:02:02.190> done<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.869> I've<00:02:03.869> used<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:05.090> barrel

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
what I've done is I've used a barrel

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.020 
what I've done is I've used a barrel
shape<00:02:06.320> or<00:02:07.320> dumbbell<00:02:07.800> as<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:07.979> put<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
shape or dumbbell as they put it well it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.219 
shape or dumbbell as they put it well it
is<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.390> only<00:02:09.570> lengthen<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.020> lock<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
is it's only lengthen to lock the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.130 
is it's only lengthen to lock the
boilers<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> lot<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:10.890> narrow<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:13.020> what

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
boilers but a lot more narrow but what

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.380 
boilers but a lot more narrow but what
else<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.739> will<00:02:14.040> ASAE's<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:15.030> terminal

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
else is I will ASAE's got terminal

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
else is I will ASAE's got terminal
pop-ups<00:02:15.780> they're<00:02:16.590> very<00:02:16.800> small<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.190> size<00:02:17.220> let's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
pop-ups they're very small in size let's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.710 
pop-ups they're very small in size let's
just<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.880> one<00:02:18.060> out<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.630> look

to<00:02:30.459> go<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> shorter<00:02:31.000> distance<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.599> cast<00:02:31.870> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
to go a shorter distance on the cast and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.140 
to go a shorter distance on the cast and
the<00:02:32.650> terminal<00:02:33.010> simple<00:02:33.340> Isis<00:02:33.550> list<00:02:33.760> air<00:02:33.910> drag

so<00:02:34.840> try<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.140> keep<00:02:35.260> your<00:02:35.410> baits<00:02:35.620> as<00:02:35.830> small<00:02:36.280> as

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
so try and keep your baits as small as

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.850 
so try and keep your baits as small as
possible<00:02:36.750> you're<00:02:37.750> looking<00:02:37.989> at<00:02:38.080> long-range

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.100 

right<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:42.010> know<00:02:42.099> look<00:02:42.280> at<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.459> cast

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
right we know look at the cast

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.839 
right we know look at the cast
hopefully<00:02:44.110> let's<00:02:44.230> put<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.410> big<00:02:45.160> lead<00:02:45.340> shot<00:02:45.519> onto

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
hopefully let's put a big lead shot onto

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.290 
hopefully let's put a big lead shot onto
the<00:02:45.970> tackle<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:47.790> we'll<00:02:48.790> hopefully<00:02:49.000> get<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
the tackle and we'll hopefully get you

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.080 
the tackle and we'll hopefully get you
some<00:02:49.480> more<00:02:49.599> distance<00:02:50.580> what<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.610> will<00:02:51.760> do<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:51.970> I'm

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
some more distance what I will do is I'm

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.240 
some more distance what I will do is I'm
going<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.330> swap<00:02:52.540> over<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.989> spot<00:02:53.260> you're

going to swap over to the spot you're

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.520 
going to swap over to the spot you're
going<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.459> cast<00:02:54.640> across<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.060> grass<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.600> just

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
going to cast across the grass and just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.780 
going to cast across the grass and just
for<00:02:56.620> safety<00:02:56.950> wise<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.700> bit<00:02:57.819> more<00:02:57.940> safe

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
for safety wise it's a bit more safe

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.750 
for safety wise it's a bit more safe
right<00:03:00.790> swapped<00:03:01.180> over<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:02.069> highest<00:03:03.069> 200<00:03:03.489> I've

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
right swapped over to a highest 200 I've

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.059 
right swapped over to a highest 200 I've

changed a real to Kissimmee yellow line

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.259 
changed a real to Kissimmee yellow line
just<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.190> case<00:03:06.340> we'd<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.640> crack<00:03:06.850> up<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.150> can

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
just in case we'd have a crack up we can

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.030 
just in case we'd have a crack up we can
find<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.630> like<00:03:07.780> easier<00:03:09.180> right<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.450> cast<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
find it like easier right on the cast it

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.830 
find it like easier right on the cast it
needs<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.580> about<00:03:13.060> half<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.360> drop<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.720> the

the lead not the bait so that's what

well what I'm trying to do there is to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.259 
well what I'm trying to do there is to
make<00:03:34.780> us<00:03:34.930> bigger<00:03:35.230> drop<00:03:35.470> as<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:37.060> get<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
make us bigger drop as I can to get the

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.199 
make us bigger drop as I can to get the
lid<00:03:37.480> traveling<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:38.019> as<00:03:38.140> bigger<00:03:38.440> arc<00:03:38.709> as<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:38.980> can

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
lid traveling on as bigger arc as I can

the<00:03:40.209> more<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.540> art<00:03:40.720> goes<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.500> faster<00:03:41.859> it's

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the more the art goes the faster it's

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.380 
the more the art goes the faster it's
going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.190> go<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.730> as<00:03:42.819> simple<00:03:42.970> as<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.269> as

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
going to go it's as simple as that as

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.789 
going to go it's as simple as that as
long<00:03:43.540> as<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.780> can<00:03:43.959> make<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.140> go<00:03:44.260> faster<00:03:44.709> which

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
long as you can make it go faster which

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.830 
long as you can make it go faster which
is<00:03:44.829> by<00:03:45.100> generating<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.060> speed<00:03:46.299> which<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.660> what

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
is by generating the speed which is what

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.190 
is by generating the speed which is what
I'll<00:03:46.930> show<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.079> now<00:03:47.459> right

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
I'll show you now right

I'll show you now right
what<00:03:50.740> I'm<00:03:50.800> gonna<00:03:50.890> be<00:03:50.980> doing<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.340> going<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.090> be

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
what I'm gonna be doing is going to be

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.840 
what I'm gonna be doing is going to be
putting<00:03:52.390> all<00:03:52.510> my<00:03:52.569> weight<00:03:52.750> onto<00:03:53.080> my<00:03:53.260> back<00:03:53.470> foot

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.160 
putting all my weight onto my back foot
so<00:03:54.850> as<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.090> start<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.480> cast<00:03:55.690> them<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.050> way

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
so as I start to cast them all the way

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.210 
so as I start to cast them all the way
here<00:03:56.380> as<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.310> step<00:03:57.580> forward<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:59.500> I'm

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
here as I step forward like that I'm

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.530 
here as I step forward like that I'm
actually<00:04:00.400> gonna<00:04:00.610> put<00:04:00.819> all<00:04:00.970> my<00:04:01.150> weight<00:04:01.180> onto

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
actually gonna put all my weight onto

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300 
actually gonna put all my weight onto
our<00:04:01.720> front<00:04:01.900> foot<00:04:02.200> as<00:04:02.680> I'm<00:04:02.830> doing<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.160> I'm

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
our front foot as I'm doing that I'm

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.790 
our front foot as I'm doing that I'm
gonna<00:04:03.430> be<00:04:03.520> pulling<00:04:03.880> down<00:04:03.910> with<00:04:04.209> my<00:04:04.300> left<00:04:04.510> hand

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.310 
gonna be pulling down with my left hand
if<00:04:05.800> I'm<00:04:05.950> right-handed

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
if I'm right-handed
