00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
collection you're also going to need a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.670 
collection you're also going to need a
little<00:00:29.090> something<00:00:29.810> to<00:00:29.869> roll<00:00:30.079> with<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:30.590> can

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
little something to roll with so you can

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.499 
little something to roll with so you can
use<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.919> toothpick<00:00:31.250> or<00:00:31.730> a<00:00:31.790> piece<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.029> copper

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
use a toothpick or a piece of copper

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.690 
use a toothpick or a piece of copper
wire<00:00:32.540> would<00:00:32.990> be<00:00:33.110> fine<00:00:33.350> even<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.160> inside<00:00:34.520> of<00:00:34.640> a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
wire would be fine even the inside of a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.430 
wire would be fine even the inside of a
pen<00:00:34.970> would<00:00:35.150> work<00:00:35.390> just<00:00:35.989> something<00:00:36.260> with<00:00:36.410> a

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
pen would work just something with a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.020 
pen would work just something with a
small<00:00:36.800> diameter<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.550> can<00:00:37.640> be<00:00:37.760> able<00:00:37.940> to

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
small diameter that you can be able to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.819 
small diameter that you can be able to
roll<00:00:38.239> around<00:00:38.390> you're<00:00:39.050> going<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.260> need<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:39.410> ruler

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
roll around you're going to need a ruler

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.160 
roll around you're going to need a ruler
and<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.460> pen<00:00:40.700> you're<00:00:41.629> going<00:00:41.840> to<00:00:41.899> need<00:00:42.050> an

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
and a pen you're going to need an

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.930 
and a pen you're going to need an
adhesive<00:00:42.350> modge<00:00:42.980> podge<00:00:43.010> works<00:00:43.609> great<00:00:43.910> or

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
adhesive modge podge works great or

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.110 
adhesive modge podge works great or
watered<00:00:44.480> down<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.899> white<00:00:45.379> glue<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:46.640> happens

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
watered down a white glue this happens

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.819 
watered down a white glue this happens
to<00:00:47.239> be<00:00:47.329> some<00:00:47.539> ultra<00:00:47.870> thick<00:00:48.079> embossing<00:00:48.590> powder

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
to be some ultra thick embossing powder

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.979 
to be some ultra thick embossing powder
and<00:00:49.129> then<00:00:49.699> we<00:00:49.789> also<00:00:49.940> need<00:00:50.180> some<00:00:50.329> embossing<00:00:50.840> ink

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
and then we also need some embossing ink

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.500 
and then we also need some embossing ink
for<00:00:51.199> this<00:00:51.320> technique<00:00:51.969> okay<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.030> let's<00:00:53.359> get

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
for this technique okay so let's get

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.869 
for this technique okay so let's get
going<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.769> I've<00:00:54.859> got<00:00:54.890> here<00:00:55.070> we're<00:00:55.550> going<00:00:55.789> to

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
going what I've got here we're going to

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.630 
going what I've got here we're going to
just<00:00:56.030> be<00:00:56.120> making<00:00:56.510> these<00:00:56.600> little<00:00:56.809> half-inch

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
just be making these little half-inch

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.329 
just be making these little half-inch
round<00:00:58.640> beads<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.649> basically<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:00.859> can<00:01:01.070> create

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
round beads and basically you can create

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.210 
round beads and basically you can create
all<00:01:02.239> sorts<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.600> different<00:01:02.750> bead<00:01:03.379> shapes<00:01:03.920> with

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
all sorts of different bead shapes with

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.560 
all sorts of different bead shapes with
this<00:01:04.370> same<00:01:04.580> technique<00:01:05.030> but<00:01:05.059> I'm<00:01:05.300> just<00:01:05.449> going

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
this same technique but I'm just going

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.430 
this same technique but I'm just going
to<00:01:05.600> show<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.840> how<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.020> make<00:01:06.110> these<00:01:06.260> little

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
to show you how to make these little

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.470 
to show you how to make these little
buns<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.310> I'm<00:01:07.400> just<00:01:07.580> taking<00:01:07.700> my<00:01:07.940> ruler<00:01:08.240> here

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
buns so I'm just taking my ruler here

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.110 
buns so I'm just taking my ruler here
and<00:01:08.690> just<00:01:08.870> on<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.110> edge<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.980> 12<00:01:10.340> by<00:01:10.520> 12<00:01:10.820> sheet

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
and just on the edge of a 12 by 12 sheet

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.569 
and just on the edge of a 12 by 12 sheet
of<00:01:11.210> paper<00:01:11.390> I'm<00:01:11.720> just<00:01:12.380> marking<00:01:12.590> every<00:01:13.159> half<00:01:13.430> an

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
of paper I'm just marking every half an

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.300 
of paper I'm just marking every half an
inch<00:01:13.990> this<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.049> going<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.380> be<00:01:15.530> basically<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
inch this is going to be basically the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.490 
inch this is going to be basically the
length<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.150> my<00:01:17.360> beads<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.079> I'm<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:18.350> going<00:01:18.470> to

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
length of my beads so I'm just going to

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.830 
length of my beads so I'm just going to
do<00:01:18.650> that<00:01:18.770> on<00:01:18.950> one<00:01:18.979> end<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.360> other<00:01:20.570> end

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
do that on one end and on the other end

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.510 
do that on one end and on the other end
what<00:01:21.380> I'm<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:21.680> do<00:01:21.860> is<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.189> create<00:01:22.490> a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
what I'm going to do is to create a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.639 
what I'm going to do is to create a
triangular<00:01:22.939> shape<00:01:23.360> I'm<00:01:23.570> actually<00:01:24.290> going<00:01:24.590> to

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
triangular shape I'm actually going to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.039 
triangular shape I'm actually going to
start<00:01:24.920> at<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.369> quarter<00:01:25.790> inch<00:01:25.970> mark<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.509> then

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
start at the quarter inch mark and then

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.530 
start at the quarter inch mark and then
from<00:01:27.380> there<00:01:27.590> go<00:01:27.619> every<00:01:28.250> half<00:01:28.490> an<00:01:28.640> inch<00:01:28.820> what

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
from there go every half an inch what

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.789 
from there go every half an inch what
this<00:01:29.689> is<00:01:29.840> going<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.049> do<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.320> just<00:01:30.470> give<00:01:30.619> me<00:01:30.770> a

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
this is going to do is just give me a

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.160 
this is going to do is just give me a
midpoint<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.000> other<00:01:32.270> end<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.960> paper

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
midpoint to the other end of the paper

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.590 
midpoint to the other end of the paper
so<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:34.520> draw<00:01:34.729> some<00:01:35.000> triangular

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
so that I can just draw some triangular

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.289 
so that I can just draw some triangular
shapes<00:01:35.899> here<00:01:36.829> across<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.670> length<00:01:37.909> of<00:01:38.119> this

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
shapes here across the length of this

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.139 
shapes here across the length of this
piece<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.689> paper<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:40.610> now<00:01:40.729> what<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:40.969> going<00:01:41.000> to

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
piece of paper so now what I'm going to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.060 
piece of paper so now what I'm going to
do<00:01:41.299> is<00:01:41.420> I'm<00:01:41.479> going<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.630> go<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.840> my<00:01:41.960> first<00:01:42.320> half

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
do is I'm going to go to my first half

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.429 
do is I'm going to go to my first half
inch<00:01:43.369> mark<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.000> side<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.570> I'm<00:01:45.259> going<00:01:45.409> to

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
inch mark on this side and I'm going to

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.249 
inch mark on this side and I'm going to
match<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.460> up<00:01:46.820> with<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.299> half<00:01:47.780> inch<00:01:48.049> mark

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
match it up with that half inch mark

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.410 
match it up with that half inch mark
that<00:01:48.500> was<00:01:48.619> started<00:01:48.979> over<00:01:49.100> here<00:01:49.280> one<00:01:50.060> quarter

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
that was started over here one quarter

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.929 
that was started over here one quarter
of<00:01:50.450> an<00:01:50.630> inch<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.860> there<00:01:52.009> we<00:01:52.159> go<00:01:52.189> now<00:01:52.850> I'm

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
of an inch in so there we go now I'm

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.160 
of an inch in so there we go now I'm
just<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.299> move<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.630> bottom<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.140> my

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
just going to move the bottom of my

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.440 
just going to move the bottom of my
ruler<00:01:54.530> over<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.189> next<00:01:55.399> mark<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.030> kept<00:01:56.329> it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
ruler over to the next mark so I kept it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.660 
ruler over to the next mark so I kept it
same<00:01:57.170> place<00:01:57.439> at<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.649> top<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.189> move<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
same place at the top and move the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.700 
same place at the top and move the
bottom<00:01:59.000> now<00:01:59.689> I'm<00:01:59.719> going<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.079> keep<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> at<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
bottom now I'm going to keep it at the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.230 
bottom now I'm going to keep it at the
same<00:02:00.740> place<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.399> bottom<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:01.880> move<00:02:02.030> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
top just so that I use up all of my

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.760 
top just so that I use up all of my
paper<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:05.930> get<00:02:06.049> these<00:02:06.200> alternating

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
paper and get these alternating

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.100 
paper and get these alternating
triangular<00:02:07.430> shapes<00:02:07.729> let's<00:02:08.660> see<00:02:08.810> if<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.960> can

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
triangular shapes let's see if I can

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.210 
triangular shapes let's see if I can
hold<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.440> up<00:02:09.500> here<00:02:09.680> I'm<00:02:09.740> not<00:02:09.830> sure<00:02:09.890> you're

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
hold it up here I'm not sure you're

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.710 
hold it up here I'm not sure you're
going<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.399> be<00:02:10.460> able<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.000> on<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.270> color

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
going to be able to see it on this color

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.900 
going to be able to see it on this color
of<00:02:11.900> paper<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:13.190> are<00:02:13.280> basically<00:02:13.730> some

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
of paper but there are basically some

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.150 
of paper but there are basically some
triangular<00:02:14.390> shapes<00:02:14.690> there<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.230> my<00:02:15.470> paper<00:02:15.710> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
triangular shapes there on my paper and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.949 
triangular shapes there on my paper and
now<00:02:16.940> all<00:02:17.150> I'm<00:02:17.269> going<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.629> is<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:17.810> going<00:02:17.900> to

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
now all I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.270 
now all I'm going to do is I'm going to
go<00:02:18.110> ahead<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.500> I'm<00:02:18.560> going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> cut<00:02:19.040> those

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
go ahead and I'm going to cut those

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.830 
go ahead and I'm going to cut those
triangular<00:02:19.879> shapes<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.450> then<00:02:20.540> I'll<00:02:20.629> show<00:02:20.810> you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
triangular shapes and then I'll show you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.550 
triangular shapes and then I'll show you
the<00:02:20.959> next<00:02:21.230> step

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the next step

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.650 
the next step
okay<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.459> next<00:02:23.670> step<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.330> kind<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
okay so the next step this is kind of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420 
okay so the next step this is kind of
the<00:02:24.750> fun<00:02:24.930> step<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.560> do<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> rolling<00:02:26.040> this

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the fun step is to do the rolling this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.130 
the fun step is to do the rolling this
is<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.090> form<00:02:27.480> your<00:02:27.690> paper

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
is actually going to form your paper

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.510 
is actually going to form your paper
bead<00:02:28.440> shape<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.220> take<00:02:29.370> your

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
bead shape so you just take your

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.040 
bead shape so you just take your
triangular<00:02:30.090> piece<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.480> paper<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> you've

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
triangular piece of paper that you've

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.920 
triangular piece of paper that you've
created<00:02:31.350> or<00:02:31.709> cut<00:02:32.069> out<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.520> around<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.450> piece<00:02:33.660> of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
created or cut out and around a piece of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.949 
created or cut out and around a piece of
copper<00:02:34.200> wire<00:02:34.380> or<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.069> toothpick<00:02:35.490> or<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.569> inside

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
copper wire or a toothpick or the inside

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.020 
copper wire or a toothpick or the inside
of<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> pen<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.980> part<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.459> holds<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.850> ink

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
of a pen the part that holds the ink

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.360 
of a pen the part that holds the ink
just<00:02:39.780> basically<00:02:40.319> start<00:02:40.709> rolling<00:02:41.160> up<00:02:41.340> your

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
just basically start rolling up your

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.090 
just basically start rolling up your
paper<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.120> want<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.569> be<00:02:42.750> really<00:02:43.020> tight<00:02:43.380> so

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
paper you want it to be really tight so

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.309 
paper you want it to be really tight so
through<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.390> I've<00:02:45.510> got<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:46.020> holding

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
through kind of I've got just holding

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.320 
through kind of I've got just holding
the<00:02:46.470> top<00:02:46.709> edge<00:02:46.920> my<00:02:47.430> fingers<00:02:47.819> here<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.209> that

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the top edge my fingers here and that

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.180 
the top edge my fingers here and that
keeps<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.690> nice<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.900> tight<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:49.830> rolling

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
keeps it nice and tight as I'm rolling

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.850 
keeps it nice and tight as I'm rolling
it<00:02:50.280> up<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.750> keep<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.500> make<00:02:52.680> sure

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
it up you just keep going just make sure

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.729 
it up you just keep going just make sure
that<00:02:52.890> your<00:02:53.640> paper<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.390> nice<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> straight<00:02:55.410> so

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
that your paper is nice and straight so

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.310 
that your paper is nice and straight so
that<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.519> evenly<00:02:56.940> rolls<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:58.170> it's

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
that it evenly rolls just because it's

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.780 
that it evenly rolls just because it's
tapered<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.890> want<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.370> even<00:02:59.519> on

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
tapered and you want it to be even on

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.090 
tapered and you want it to be even on
both<00:03:00.000> sides<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:01.500> again<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.950> make<00:03:02.040> a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
both sides but again if you make a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.620 
both sides but again if you make a
mistake<00:03:02.280> don't<00:03:02.610> worry<00:03:02.700> about<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.269> unroll

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
mistake don't worry about it just unroll

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
mistake don't worry about it just unroll
it<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.110> try<00:03:04.680> again

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
it and try again

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.490 
it and try again
we<00:03:05.519> haven't<00:03:05.730> glued<00:03:05.850> anything<00:03:06.300> down<00:03:06.450> yet<00:03:06.780> once

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
we haven't glued anything down yet once

we haven't glued anything down yet once
you're<00:03:07.650> about<00:03:07.830> three<00:03:08.220> inches<00:03:08.580> from<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> edge

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
you're about three inches from the edge

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.300 
you're about three inches from the edge
just<00:03:10.019> open<00:03:10.319> up<00:03:10.410> your<00:03:10.470> adhesive<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.250> just

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
just open up your adhesive and just

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.540 
just open up your adhesive and just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
thin even coat to the edge here and then

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.949 
thin even coat to the edge here and then
go<00:03:20.100> back<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.670> just<00:03:21.060> continue<00:03:21.540> rolling<00:03:21.870> up

adhesive on otherwise it'll squeeze out

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.330 
adhesive on otherwise it'll squeeze out
the<00:03:24.720> sides

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
the sides

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.199

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
nice even coverage and there we go there

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.850 
nice even coverage and there we go there
we've<00:03:30.840> got<00:03:30.870> our<00:03:31.079> bead<00:03:31.230> shape<00:03:31.410> I'll<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.739> add

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
we've got our bead shape I'll just add

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
edge here to make sure it stays down but

to<00:04:11.430> dip<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.670> right<00:04:12.060> into<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.570> embossing

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
to dip it right into the embossing

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.890 
to dip it right into the embossing
powder<00:04:12.989> just<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.470> that's<00:04:13.650> really<00:04:14.040> easy<00:04:14.900> then

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
powder just like that's really easy then

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.490 
powder just like that's really easy then
take<00:04:16.109> your<00:04:16.289> heat<00:04:16.500> gun<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.510> slowly<00:04:18.510> while

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
take your heat gun and slowly while

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.960 
take your heat gun and slowly while
you're<00:04:19.709> heating<00:04:19.919> this<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.370> what<00:04:20.700> we're<00:04:20.850> going

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
you're heating this up what we're going

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.659 
you're heating this up what we're going
to<00:04:21.000> do<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.419> I'm<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.690> going<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.289> turn<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:23.370> bead

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
to do is I'm just going to turn the bead

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.390 
to do is I'm just going to turn the bead
on<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.810> toothpick<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.410> I'm<00:04:25.919> heating<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.310> up

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
on the toothpick as I'm heating it up

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.820 
on the toothpick as I'm heating it up
and<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:27.750> reason<00:04:27.870> for<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.229> is<00:04:28.440> simply<00:04:28.710> that

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
and the reason for that is simply that

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.190 
and the reason for that is simply that
if<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.340> heat<00:04:29.550> up<00:04:29.700> your<00:04:29.880> embossing<00:04:30.659> powder<00:04:30.930> on

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
if you heat up your embossing powder on

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.230 
if you heat up your embossing powder on
your<00:04:31.770> bead<00:04:31.950> without<00:04:32.250> turning<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:33.090> will

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
your bead without turning it it will

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.700 
your bead without turning it it will
actually<00:04:33.539> start<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.780> drip<00:04:34.080> off<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.500> sides

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
actually start to drip off of the sides

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.460 
actually start to drip off of the sides
and<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.010> won't<00:04:35.190> get<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.370> very<00:04:35.580> even

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
and you won't get a very even

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.439 
and you won't get a very even
to<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.650> shiny<00:04:37.889> coating<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.580> your<00:04:38.849> beads<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.360> if

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
to the shiny coating of your beads so if

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.480 
to the shiny coating of your beads so if
you<00:04:39.569> rotate<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.199> and<00:04:40.229> do<00:04:41.009> this<00:04:41.129> really<00:04:41.370> slowly

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
you rotate it and do this really slowly

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.270 
you rotate it and do this really slowly
then<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.449> get<00:04:42.569> a<00:04:42.599> nice<00:04:42.810> even<00:04:43.020> Sheen<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.830> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
then you get a nice even Sheen on the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.249 
then you get a nice even Sheen on the
edge<00:04:44.430> of<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:44.759> bead<00:04:44.939> there<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.870> we'll<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.110> go

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
edge of the bead there so we'll just go

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:46.760 
edge of the bead there so we'll just go
like<00:04:46.379> this

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
like this

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.100 
like this
now<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.490> like<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:47.729> really<00:04:47.849> thick<00:04:48.330> layer<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.810> while

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
now I like a really thick layer so while

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.540 
now I like a really thick layer so while
this<00:04:49.259> is<00:04:49.319> still<00:04:49.560> wet<00:04:49.800> I'm<00:04:49.979> just<00:04:50.189> going<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.370> go

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
this is still wet I'm just going to go

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.760 
this is still wet I'm just going to go
back<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.360> dip<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.990> back<00:04:52.229> into<00:04:52.530> the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
back in and dip it back into the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.369 
back in and dip it back into the
embossing<00:04:53.039> powder<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.990> then<00:04:54.990> I'm<00:04:55.080> just<00:04:55.199> going

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
embossing powder and then I'm just going

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.559 
embossing powder and then I'm just going
to<00:04:55.469> heat<00:04:55.620> up<00:04:55.710> my<00:04:55.830> second<00:04:56.189> layer<00:04:56.280> now<00:04:57.090> again<00:04:57.389> be

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
to heat up my second layer now again be

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:58.879 
to heat up my second layer now again be
really<00:04:57.810> careful<00:04:58.139> that<00:04:58.259> you're<00:04:58.379> rotating<00:04:58.530> it

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
really careful that you're rotating it

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.520 
really careful that you're rotating it
here<00:04:59.159> you<00:04:59.280> have<00:04:59.460> quite<00:04:59.729> a<00:04:59.759> thick<00:05:00.259> coating<00:05:01.259> of

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
here you have quite a thick coating of

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.649 
here you have quite a thick coating of
the<00:05:01.949> embossing<00:05:02.340> powder<00:05:02.550> on<00:05:02.849> here<00:05:03.210> now<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:03.629> you

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
the embossing powder on here now so you

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.020 
the embossing powder on here now so you
don't<00:05:03.900> want<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.379> get<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.099> drippy<00:05:05.610> look<00:05:05.819> as

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
don't want it to get that drippy look as

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.640 
don't want it to get that drippy look as
you're<00:05:06.240> working<00:05:06.509> with<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.199> keep<00:05:07.439> rotating

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
you're working with it so keep rotating

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.610 
you're working with it so keep rotating
it<00:05:08.039> slowly<00:05:08.780> now<00:05:09.780> there's<00:05:09.990> all<00:05:10.110> sorts<00:05:10.379> of<00:05:10.440> other

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
it slowly now there's all sorts of other

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.110 
it slowly now there's all sorts of other
ways<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:11.129> could<00:05:11.340> do<00:05:11.460> this<00:05:11.580> as<00:05:11.759> well<00:05:11.909> you

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
ways that you could do this as well you

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.330 
ways that you could do this as well you
can<00:05:12.300> use<00:05:12.569> some<00:05:12.840> glossy<00:05:13.500> accents<00:05:14.069> and<00:05:14.190> just

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
can use some glossy accents and just

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.730 
can use some glossy accents and just
kind<00:05:14.849> of<00:05:14.909> paint<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.509> some<00:05:16.199> Mod<00:05:16.469> Podge

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
kind of paint that on some Mod Podge

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.550 
kind of paint that on some Mod Podge
some<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.190> glossy<00:05:17.430> modge<00:05:17.759> podge<00:05:17.879> and<00:05:18.330> all<00:05:19.319> of

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
some the glossy modge podge and all of

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.320 
some the glossy modge podge and all of
those<00:05:19.710> techniques<00:05:20.129> work<00:05:20.340> equally<00:05:20.789> well<00:05:20.879> the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
those techniques work equally well the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.390 
those techniques work equally well the
reason<00:05:21.629> I<00:05:21.690> like<00:05:21.900> this<00:05:22.110> one<00:05:22.289> is<00:05:22.500> because<00:05:23.069> soon

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
reason I like this one is because soon

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.070 
reason I like this one is because soon
as<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.639> turn<00:05:23.969> off<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:24.270> heat<00:05:24.539> gun<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.780> wait

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
as I turn off this heat gun and wait

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.140 
as I turn off this heat gun and wait
just<00:05:25.319> a<00:05:25.409> few<00:05:25.590> seconds<00:05:26.039> it's<00:05:26.520> going<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:26.759> be<00:05:26.909> dry

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
just a few seconds it's going to be dry

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.029 
just a few seconds it's going to be dry
and<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.479> can<00:05:27.659> handle<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.139> and<00:05:28.169> work<00:05:28.469> on<00:05:28.680> my

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
and I can handle it and work on my

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.589 
and I can handle it and work on my
project<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.580> tend<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.029> be<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> little<00:05:30.419> bit

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
project I tend to be a little bit

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.409 
project I tend to be a little bit
impatient<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.430> just<00:05:32.819> like<00:05:32.969> the<00:05:33.210> quick

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
impatient so I just like the quick

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.629 
impatient so I just like the quick
drying<00:05:33.750> aspect<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:34.770> this<00:05:34.979> technique<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.610> make

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
drying aspect of this technique to make

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.670 
drying aspect of this technique to make
it<00:05:35.849> a<00:05:35.909> little<00:05:36.060> bit<00:05:36.210> glossy<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:37.199> there<00:05:37.349> you<00:05:37.500> go

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
it a little bit glossy so there you go

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.740 
it a little bit glossy so there you go
you<00:05:38.009> can<00:05:38.729> see<00:05:38.909> I'm<00:05:39.000> just<00:05:39.029> rotating<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.689> a

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
you can see I'm just rotating it a

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.510 
you can see I'm just rotating it a
little<00:05:39.930> bit<00:05:40.080> more<00:05:40.259> just<00:05:40.440> as<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.740> dries<00:05:40.979> here<00:05:41.370> if

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
little bit more just as it dries here if

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.519 
little bit more just as it dries here if
you<00:05:42.029> only<00:05:42.240> put<00:05:42.479> one<00:05:42.539> layer<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.259> don't<00:05:43.409> have

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
you only put one layer on you don't have

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.580 
you only put one layer on you don't have
to<00:05:43.650> wait<00:05:43.800> quite<00:05:44.039> this<00:05:44.250> long<00:05:44.490> till<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.330> dries<00:05:45.599> it

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
to wait quite this long till it dries it

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.019 
to wait quite this long till it dries it
will<00:05:46.770> go<00:05:46.889> a<00:05:46.919> lot<00:05:47.099> quicker<00:05:47.159> if<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.699> have<00:05:47.819> just

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
will go a lot quicker if you have just

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.360 
will go a lot quicker if you have just
one<00:05:48.120> thin<00:05:48.569> layer<00:05:48.650> so<00:05:49.650> I'm<00:05:49.710> just<00:05:49.919> going<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.129> kind

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
one thin layer so I'm just going to kind

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.360 
one thin layer so I'm just going to kind
of<00:05:50.430> pop<00:05:50.639> it<00:05:50.669> off<00:05:50.909> now<00:05:51.180> whoops<00:05:51.690> there<00:05:52.020> goes<00:05:52.370> just

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
of pop it off now whoops there goes just

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.219 
of pop it off now whoops there goes just
move<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.669> out<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:53.969> the<00:05:54.060> way<00:05:54.150> and<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:54.960> can<00:05:55.110> see

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
move this out of the way and you can see

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.809 
move this out of the way and you can see
it's<00:05:55.349> already<00:05:55.529> dry<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:55.949> I<00:05:56.190> already<00:05:56.550> have<00:05:56.699> this

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
it's already dry and I already have this

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.760 
it's already dry and I already have this
beautiful<00:05:57.120> glossy<00:05:57.449> bead<00:05:57.839> that<00:05:58.409> I<00:05:58.440> can<00:05:58.650> work
