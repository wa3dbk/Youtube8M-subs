00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.380
 we are in one of the oldest cars yet 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.509
 for me in France 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.380
 it's a wrong pedo hen 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.730
 high-end 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.599
 who is a beautiful sienna 521 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.370
 so these main features it's a six-cylinder engine in line 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.820
 with 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.890
 delitte 5 of cubic capacity 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 and if this model is an evolution of the 520 it came out a year ago 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 in 10 927 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 she who was out yesterday in lithium finland 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.260
 by the way m a six-cylinder engine in line 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 and we have the roadster version which is the main version 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.320
 what was fashionable at the time 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.070
 but at the level of the scenery also a little all high-end cars then 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.640
 if this version also exists in sedan 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 meierhans had very few flags to make 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 for the moment we know three existing models in France of this 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.710
 top and water 521 and this is characterized by the hf6 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.800
 % and is a convertible arena on the case of places or 5 places as on a 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.460
 sedan rk era the cars we know quite a bit of toll pavilion 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.120
 because we did not know how to stamp 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.490
 large areas of rate and making them rigid so 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 to these are often in torpedo deserts this car has 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.040
 been manufactured in its different versions 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.330
 about 20000 copies 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.390
 over the space of three years ago there was a lot that was exported 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.750
 in South America 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.380
 and in Australia 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.929
 it's a bit like the voice that we find the most 7 interiors and leather 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.380
 percent and a dashboard in walnut 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.290
 % of equipment on board quite complete for the time with oil pressure 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.889
 hanged 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.469
 quidam in odometer allow it was rare 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.549
 already versions drivers driving right 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.369
 because a lot have been exported 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.959
 the time it was still 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.799
 there the period of permutations between driving on the right, driving on the left
