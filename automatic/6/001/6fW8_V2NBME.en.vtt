make their phone names are they use the

make their phone names are they use the

mouth and use the a it's not always the

case but I figured instead of trying to
accommodate<00:03:26.519> every<00:03:26.940> possible<00:03:27.389> Circuit

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
accommodate every possible Circuit

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.869 
accommodate every possible Circuit
circumstance<00:03:28.169> I'd<00:03:28.560> at<00:03:28.739> least<00:03:28.919> start<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.430> a

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
circumstance I'd at least start from a

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.569 
circumstance I'd at least start from a
ground<00:03:30.389> rule<00:03:30.659> and<00:03:30.930> ask<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.169> Ryan<00:03:31.379> figure<00:03:31.680> we

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
ground rule and ask that Ryan figure we

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.949 
ground rule and ask that Ryan figure we
see<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.879> we<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.239> few<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.819> letters

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
see that we have a few of the letters

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.729 
see that we have a few of the letters
missing<00:03:37.010> but<00:03:38.010> Ryan<00:03:38.280> has<00:03:38.549> some<00:03:39.470> morphs<00:03:40.470> that

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
missing but Ryan has some morphs that

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.599 
missing but Ryan has some morphs that
are<00:03:41.430> similar<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.389> what<00:03:43.049> we'd<00:03:43.379> find<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:44.010> Ryan

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
are similar to what we'd find with Ryan

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.460 
are similar to what we'd find with Ryan
in<00:03:44.849> these<00:03:44.970> positions<00:03:45.169> I've<00:03:46.169> already<00:03:46.379> gone

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
in these positions I've already gone

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.039 
in these positions I've already gone
through<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.709> liberty<00:03:47.069> of<00:03:47.150> picking<00:03:48.150> what's

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
through the liberty of picking what's

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.330 
through the liberty of picking what's
more<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.530> think<00:03:49.590> best<00:03:50.040> represent<00:03:50.840> Ryan<00:03:51.840> in

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
more I think best represent Ryan in

more I think best represent Ryan in
those<00:03:53.340> positions<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.120> want<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.359> enter<00:03:54.569> those

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
those positions so I want to enter those

I'm phony would give a certain shape and
they<00:06:34.490> match<00:06:34.699> up<00:06:34.729> pretty<00:06:35.120> well<00:06:35.210> they<00:06:35.870> tend<00:06:36.080> to
