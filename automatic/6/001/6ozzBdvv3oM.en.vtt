the E flat D flat my right here and a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
the E flat D flat my right here and a
lot<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> times<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.259> throw<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.710> ninth<00:01:34.950> or

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
lot of times I throw in that ninth or

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.419 
lot of times I throw in that ninth or
that<00:01:35.429> second<00:01:36.590> give<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.679> a<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.890> dissonant

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
that second give it a more dissonant

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.699 
that second give it a more dissonant
sound<00:01:38.729> especially<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.360> song<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
sound especially a song like this if I

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.020 
sound especially a song like this if I
was<00:01:40.829> playing<00:01:41.039> something<00:01:41.429> like<00:01:41.490> Amazing<00:01:42.000> Grace

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
was playing something like Amazing Grace

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
was playing something like Amazing Grace
I<00:01:42.390> probably<00:01:42.659> wouldn't<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:44.069> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
I probably wouldn't do that as much I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
I probably wouldn't do that as much I
might<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.819> here<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.560> try<00:01:46.560> to

might a little here and there but try to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.850 
might a little here and there but try to
keep<00:01:46.709> that<00:01:47.039> keep<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.549> cleaner<00:01:47.850> sound<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
keep that keep a cleaner sound this is a

so<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:59.099> will<00:02:00.619> enter<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.619> will<00:02:05.220> enter<00:02:05.459> his<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
so I will enter so I will enter his and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.080 
so I will enter so I will enter his and
on<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> word<00:02:07.289> here<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.739> bring<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.369> nine

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
on the word here is I bring in that nine

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.039 
on the word here is I bring in that nine
with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> seven<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.079> will<00:02:10.829> enter<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.510> that

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
with the seven I will enter and that

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.690 
with the seven I will enter and that
gives<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.410> feeling<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.799> change<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.549> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
gives a feeling of change going to the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.120 
gives a feeling of change going to the
one<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> for<00:02:15.329> this<00:02:15.870> gates<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:17.040> on

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
one to the for this gates and then on

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.530 
one to the for this gates and then on
Gaetti<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.849> think<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.209> playing<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
Gaetti that I think I was playing the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.170 
Gaetti that I think I was playing the
seventh<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.140> gates<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:22.549> in<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.730> derogate

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
seventh on the gates to in that derogate

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.630 
seventh on the gates to in that derogate
that<00:02:24.510> goes<00:02:24.690> back<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.170> rhythm<00:02:25.380> path

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.010 

so<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.470> see<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.850> that's<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.120> d-flat

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
so you can see that so that's a d-flat

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.310 
so you can see that so that's a d-flat
g-flat<00:02:35.460> over<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.700> flat<00:02:36.910> B<00:02:37.180> flat<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
g-flat over a flat B flat and then the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
g-flat over a flat B flat and then the
inner<00:02:38.470> harmony<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.070> walking<00:02:39.550> out

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
inner harmony is walking out

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.199 
inner harmony is walking out
a<00:02:41.400> flat<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> flat<00:02:42.269> E<00:02:42.629> flat<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:42.989> E<00:02:43.110> flat<00:02:43.200> C<00:02:43.709> E<00:02:44.209> flat

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
a flat a flat E flat or E flat C E flat

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.540 
a flat a flat E flat or E flat C E flat
B<00:02:45.510> flat<00:02:45.780> E<00:02:45.989> flat<00:02:46.019> /<00:02:46.440> E<00:02:46.470> flat<00:02:46.769> D<00:02:46.830> flat<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.430> I'm

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
B flat E flat / E flat D flat and I'm

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.960 
B flat E flat / E flat D flat and I'm
walking<00:02:47.910> back<00:02:48.030> down

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.720 

and<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.690> really<00:02:53.900> important<00:02:54.730> rhythm

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
and this is a really important rhythm

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.790 
and this is a really important rhythm
function<00:02:56.240> because<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.840> works<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.350> lot<00:02:57.440> of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
function because it works on a lot of
