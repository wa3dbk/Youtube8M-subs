the<00:02:33.650> new<00:02:33.799> creatures<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.519> would<00:02:34.670> seem<00:02:34.940> that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the new creatures it would seem that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.420 
the new creatures it would seem that
wearing<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.140> pumpkin<00:02:36.290> prevents<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.099> mold<00:02:37.280> from

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
wearing a pumpkin prevents the mold from

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.280 
wearing a pumpkin prevents the mold from
seeing<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.030> yeah<00:02:38.870> that's<00:02:39.079> what<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.230> said

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
seeing you yeah that's what I said

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.710 
seeing you yeah that's what I said
before<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.030> see<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.390> he's<00:02:41.480> wearing<00:02:41.510> a

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
before you can see that he's wearing a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.420 
before you can see that he's wearing a
pumpkin<00:02:41.840> maybe<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:42.590> means<00:02:42.739> they<00:02:43.010> can't<00:02:43.190> see

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
pumpkin maybe that means they can't see

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.890 
pumpkin maybe that means they can't see
you<00:02:43.610> they<00:02:43.790> didn't<00:02:44.000> attack<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:44.660> um

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
you they didn't attack you but um

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.180 
you they didn't attack you but um

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
obviously it doesn't work against

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.009 
obviously it doesn't work against
skeletons<00:02:46.790> because<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.239> skeletons<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:47.870> you

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019
