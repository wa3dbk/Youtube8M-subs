we're not once I've washed my hair what
I<00:00:19.780> do<00:00:19.900> is<00:00:20.410> I<00:00:20.740> put<00:00:20.770> some<00:00:21.460> of<00:00:21.580> my<00:00:21.610> matrix<00:00:22.180> 1<00:00:22.600> boost

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
I do is I put some of my matrix 1 boost

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.600 
I do is I put some of my matrix 1 boost
and<00:00:23.440> the<00:00:23.580> root<00:00:24.580> lifter<00:00:25.530> through<00:00:26.530> the<00:00:26.650> top<00:00:26.890> so

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
and the root lifter through the top so

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.120 
and the root lifter through the top so
just<00:00:27.820> kind<00:00:28.000> of<00:00:28.060> sectioning<00:00:28.720> bits<00:00:29.590> and<00:00:29.950> just

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130

which<00:00:32.349> is<00:00:32.529> really<00:00:32.770> cool<00:00:32.980> because<00:00:33.100> you<00:00:33.280> can

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
which is really cool because you can

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340 
which is really cool because you can
just<00:00:33.460> spray<00:00:33.850> into<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.360> root<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.780> then<00:00:35.170> it's

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
just spray into the root and then it's

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.700 
just spray into the root and then it's
kind<00:00:35.560> of<00:00:35.700> heat<00:00:36.700> activated<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.780> then<00:00:38.260> once<00:00:38.500> you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
kind of heat activated and then once you

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.520 
kind of heat activated and then once you
sort<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:38.950> blow<00:00:39.190> drying<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.700> you<00:00:39.760> get<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:39.940> lot<00:00:40.150> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
sort of blow drying it you get a lot of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.830 
sort of blow drying it you get a lot of
like<00:00:41.530> root<00:00:41.920> at<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:42.940> volume<00:00:43.390> at<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.600> room

basically get a grip and this is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.930 
basically get a grip and this is
definitely<00:02:05.049> my<00:02:05.549> night<00:02:06.549> out<00:02:06.789> hair<00:02:07.389> definitely

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.610 

so<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.230> literally<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.730> half<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.270> hair

so just literally and a half my hair
seek<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> rest<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.100> top<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.580> head<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:20.690> try<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
seek the rest on top of my head I try to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.240 
seek the rest on top of my head I try to
get<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> bottom<00:02:22.230> part<00:02:22.380> right<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> find<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.130> I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
get the bottom part right I find if I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.920 
get the bottom part right I find if I
get<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.460> bottom<00:02:23.700> part<00:02:23.820> right<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.750> rest

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
get the bottom part right then the rest

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.150 
get the bottom part right then the rest
kind<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.320> falls<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:27.030> place<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.770> I'm<00:02:28.920> going

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
kind of falls in to place and I'm going

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.030 
kind of falls in to place and I'm going
to<00:02:29.220> use<00:02:29.340> my<00:02:29.370> valise<00:02:29.970> curling<00:02:30.390> wand<00:02:30.600> now<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.740> i

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to use my valise curling wand now this i

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.080 
to use my valise curling wand now this i
believe<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.550> around<00:02:32.960> 1999<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.440> 20<00:02:34.860> good

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
believe was around 1999 so 20 good

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.270 
believe was around 1999 so 20 good
company<00:02:36.090> go<00:02:36.240> wrong<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:37.320> goes<00:02:37.530> from<00:02:37.890> i'm

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
company go wrong and it goes from i'm

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.560 
company go wrong and it goes from i'm
not<00:02:38.460> going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.640> touch<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.850> because<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.450> is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
not going to touch it because it is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.420 
not going to touch it because it is
actually<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> little<00:02:41.250> lie

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
actually on you can see the little lie

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.520 
actually on you can see the little lie
on<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:42.090> goes<00:02:42.270> some<00:02:42.450> larger<00:02:42.960> tapirs<00:02:43.500> are

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
on there goes some larger tapirs are

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.430 
on there goes some larger tapirs are
smaller<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.000> i<00:02:45.030> generally<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> hold

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
smaller and so i generally kind of hold

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.250 
smaller and so i generally kind of hold
it<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.740> way<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> get<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:49.080> held

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
it that way to get the it can be held

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.080 
it that way to get the it can be held
differently<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> lot<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.670> people<00:02:50.760> think

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
differently know a lot of people think

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.850 
differently know a lot of people think
you<00:02:51.240> can<00:02:51.450> hold<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.870> sort<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.560> should<00:02:52.740> be

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
you can hold it sort of it should be

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.040 
you can hold it sort of it should be
held<00:02:53.070> one<00:02:53.310> way<00:02:53.520> but<00:02:54.240> you'll<00:02:54.510> obviously<00:02:54.630> get<00:02:55.020> a

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
held one way but you'll obviously get a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.250 
held one way but you'll obviously get a
different<00:02:55.260> effect<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.890> way<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.100> hold<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.670> and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
different effect the way you hold on and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.810 
different effect the way you hold on and
you<00:02:58.260> have<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.650> see<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.280> little<00:03:02.460> light<00:03:02.790> on

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
you have you can see the little light on

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.850 
you have you can see the little light on
there<00:03:03.270> you've<00:03:03.450> got<00:03:03.510> different<00:03:03.900> temperatures

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
there you've got different temperatures

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670 
there you've got different temperatures
I<00:03:05.160> never<00:03:05.760> put<00:03:06.000> mine<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> top<00:03:06.630> ever<00:03:06.990> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
I never put mine to the top ever and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.370 
I never put mine to the top ever and
because<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:09.060> feel<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.630> my<00:03:09.870> hair<00:03:10.140> needs

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
because I don't feel that my hair needs

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.440 
because I don't feel that my hair needs
that<00:03:10.890> much<00:03:11.100> heat<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:11.730> quite<00:03:11.910> fine<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.360> it's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that much heat it's quite fine so it's

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.260 
that much heat it's quite fine so it's
Charles<00:03:12.780> quite<00:03:12.930> easily<00:03:13.080> get<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.920> little<00:03:14.270> he

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
Charles quite easily get the little he

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.900 
Charles quite easily get the little he
proved<00:03:15.480> glove<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.980> minds<00:03:17.250> actually<00:03:17.610> hot

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
proved glove and minds actually hot

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
proved glove and minds actually hot
enough<00:03:18.180> now<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.630> flashes<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.320> then<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.530> will

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
enough now it flashes and then it will

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.720 
enough now it flashes and then it will
stay<00:03:19.970> amber<00:03:20.970> when<00:03:21.270> it's<00:03:21.480> heated<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
stay amber when it's heated so the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.130 
stay amber when it's heated so the
larger<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.950> section<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.430> hair<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.480> kind<00:03:28.050> of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
larger the section of hair the kind of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.350 
larger the section of hair the kind of
less<00:03:28.770> curl<00:03:29.190> you'll<00:03:29.430> get<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.790> get<00:03:29.940> more<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.239> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
less curl you'll get you get more of a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.030 
less curl you'll get you get more of a
wave<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.870> never<00:03:34.170> take<00:03:34.410> mine<00:03:34.680> right<00:03:34.890> to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
wave and and I never take mine right to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.229 
wave and and I never take mine right to
the<00:03:35.160> root<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.520> obviously<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:36.000> have

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
the root because obviously I have

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.050 
the root because obviously I have
extensions<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:36.989> which<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.410> probably<00:03:37.620> see

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
extensions in which you can probably see

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.130 
extensions in which you can probably see
so<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.959> don't<00:03:40.380> want<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.830> obviously<00:03:41.840> heat<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
so I don't want to obviously heat the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.190 
so I don't want to obviously heat the
bond<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:45.030> will<00:03:45.239> obviously<00:03:45.480> loosen

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
bond because that will obviously loosen

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.400 
bond because that will obviously loosen
it<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:47.010> try<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.970> try<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.360> get<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:48.870> close<00:03:49.080> to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
it but try I try and get it as close to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.259 
it but try I try and get it as close to
the<00:03:49.530> top<00:03:49.800> as<00:03:50.100> possible<00:03:50.610> because<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.880> look<00:03:51.030> sort

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
the top as possible because I look sort

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.690 
the top as possible because I look sort
of<00:03:51.330> slightly<00:03:51.540> larger<00:03:51.690> curls<00:03:52.350> just<00:03:52.739> take<00:03:53.430> up<00:03:53.580> a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
of slightly larger curls just take up a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.650 
of slightly larger curls just take up a
medium<00:03:54.360> piece<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.380> hair<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:57.060> don't<00:03:57.269> even<00:03:57.450> need

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
medium piece of hair you don't even need

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.970 
medium piece of hair you don't even need
to<00:03:57.810> hold<00:03:58.019> on<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.769> for<00:03:59.209> that<00:04:00.209> long<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.800> it

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
to hold on that for that long and it

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.850 
to hold on that for that long and it
creates<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.670> awesome<00:04:03.630> curl<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.680> i<00:04:04.800> think

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
creates this awesome curl which i think

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.830 
creates this awesome curl which i think
is<00:04:05.190> more<00:04:05.340> evil<00:04:05.550> wavicle<00:04:06.120> anyway<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.600> don't

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
is more evil wavicle anyway I don't

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.800 
is more evil wavicle anyway I don't
think<00:04:07.230> it's<00:04:07.380> like<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> ringlet<00:04:08.190> curl<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:09.570> me

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
think it's like a ringlet curl to me

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.660 
think it's like a ringlet curl to me
that<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.200> more<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.560> wavy<00:04:10.950> kale<00:04:11.160> which<00:04:11.489> I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that is more of a wavy kale which I

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.470 
that is more of a wavy kale which I
really<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.780> look<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.269> put

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
really like the look of and if you put

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.210 
really like the look of and if you put
ringlets<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:15.989> my<00:04:16.109> head<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.650> look<00:04:16.859> like

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
ringlets in my head and I just look like

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.900 
ringlets in my head and I just look like
any<00:04:17.700> do<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:18.200> look<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.859> child<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.729> yeah

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
any do I look like a child but yeah

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.120 
any do I look like a child but yeah
basically

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.790 

this<00:04:30.130> is<00:04:30.310> why<00:04:30.490> do<00:04:31.199> and<00:04:32.199> it's<00:04:32.380> like<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.770> easiest

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
this is why do and it's like the easiest

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.309 
this is why do and it's like the easiest
thing<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.699> use<00:04:33.849> is<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.419> because<00:04:34.960> once<00:04:35.169> I've

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
thing to use is it's because once I've

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.100 
thing to use is it's because once I've
done<00:04:35.530> this<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:36.190> curl<00:04:36.550> lasts<00:04:37.120> me<00:04:37.270> until<00:04:38.080> I

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
done this this curl lasts me until I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.950 
done this this curl lasts me until I
wash<00:04:38.530> my<00:04:38.710> hair<00:04:38.919> again<00:04:39.069> and<00:04:39.669> I'd<00:04:39.849> probably<00:04:40.180> say

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
wash my hair again and I'd probably say

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:54.920 
wash my hair again and I'd probably say
I<00:04:44.190> wash<00:04:45.190> my<00:04:45.520> hair<00:04:48.539> every<00:04:49.539> three<00:04:49.930> days<00:04:50.169> and<00:04:51.660> so

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.400 

this<00:04:55.930> curl<00:04:56.380> lasts<00:04:57.310> like<00:04:57.639> no<00:04:58.509> other<00:04:58.720> even<00:04:59.380> when

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
this curl lasts like no other even when

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.860 
this curl lasts like no other even when
I<00:04:59.919> curl<00:05:00.639> my<00:05:00.669> hair<00:05:00.940> with<00:05:03.570> straighteners<00:05:04.570> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
I curl my hair with straighteners the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.150 
I curl my hair with straighteners the
curtain<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.800> curl<00:05:06.070> doesn't<00:05:06.520> last<00:05:06.699> as<00:05:07.030> long<00:05:07.080> so

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
curtain the curl doesn't last as long so

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.249 
curtain the curl doesn't last as long so
this<00:05:09.160> little<00:05:09.699> one<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.479> like<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:11.080> best

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
this little one is like the best

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.230 
this little one is like the best
invention<00:05:11.830> ever<00:05:11.919> there's<00:05:12.490> such<00:05:12.639> defined

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
invention ever there's such defined

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.719

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.730 

you<00:05:39.940> can<00:05:40.090> obviously<00:05:40.320> separate<00:05:41.320> them<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:43.740> i

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740

then I literally take the rest of it

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.620 
then I literally take the rest of it
down<00:05:55.680> because<00:05:56.680> I'm<00:05:57.070> lazy<00:05:57.699> and<00:05:57.969> don't<00:05:58.300> do<00:05:58.449> too
