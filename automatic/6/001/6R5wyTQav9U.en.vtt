lays a periodontal treatment especially

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.240 
lays a periodontal treatment especially
with<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.610> perio<00:00:03.030> lays<00:00:03.389> laser<00:00:03.870> has<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> great

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
with the perio lays laser has a great

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.179 
with the perio lays laser has a great
effect<00:00:05.490> on<00:00:05.970> controlling<00:00:06.750> bleeding<00:00:07.560> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
effect on controlling bleeding the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.950 
effect on controlling bleeding the
reason<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.730> does<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.540> has<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
reason it does this is it has the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.530 
reason it does this is it has the
ability<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> seal<00:00:11.130> off<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.820> vessels<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
ability to seal off the vessels and the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.020 
ability to seal off the vessels and the
nerves<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.769> accomplishes<00:00:14.280> two<00:00:14.429> things<00:00:14.639> at

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
nerves so it accomplishes two things at

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.470 
nerves so it accomplishes two things at
once<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.710> stops<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.010> bleeding<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:18.000> abtin

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
once it stops the bleeding and it abtin
