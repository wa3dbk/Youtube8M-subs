the<00:00:37.629> way<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:37.989> machine<00:00:38.199> works<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:38.979> here<00:00:39.580> you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
the way this machine works is here you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.390 
the way this machine works is here you
have<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> hopper<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.900> in<00:00:41.500> this<00:00:41.710> hopper<00:00:42.010> you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
have a hopper and in this hopper you

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.250 
have a hopper and in this hopper you
face<00:00:42.879> your<00:00:43.120> empty<00:00:43.479> bobbins<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.839> filling

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
face your empty bobbins with a filling

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.070 
face your empty bobbins with a filling
up<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.589> don't<00:00:48.580> overload<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.330> machine<00:00:49.600> but

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
up you don't overload the machine but

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.960 
up you don't overload the machine but
make<00:00:50.320> sure<00:00:50.350> you've<00:00:50.799> always<00:00:51.070> got<00:00:51.400> bobbins<00:00:51.790> in

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
make sure you've always got bobbins in

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.109 
make sure you've always got bobbins in
there<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.869> next<00:00:52.900> stage<00:00:53.440> is<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.909> thread<00:00:54.909> your

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119 
there the next stage is to thread your

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.049 
there the next stage is to thread your
needle<00:00:55.330> with<00:00:55.960> your<00:00:56.379> under<00:00:56.890> thread<00:00:57.159> so<00:00:58.030> that

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
needle with your under thread so that

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.500 
needle with your under thread so that
goes<00:00:58.479> in<00:01:00.299> like<00:01:01.299> this<00:01:01.330> and<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.670> important

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
goes in like this and it's important

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:13.070 
goes in like this and it's important
that<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:05.320> neat<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.950> thread<00:01:06.360> holes<00:01:11.100> straight

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that the neat the thread holes straight

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.780 
that the neat the thread holes straight
that<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.260> should<00:01:14.530> be<00:01:14.680> in<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.980> middle<00:01:15.220> of<00:01:15.520> that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
that it should be in the middle of that

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.540 
that it should be in the middle of that
spindle<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:17.080> reason<00:01:17.470> for<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:18.100> that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
spindle and the reason for that is that

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.420 
spindle and the reason for that is that
when<00:01:18.820> your<00:01:19.000> bobbin<00:01:19.420> comes<00:01:20.080> out<00:01:20.320> here<00:01:20.770> it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
when your bobbin comes out here it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.790 
when your bobbin comes out here it
catches<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.240> thread<00:01:22.270> between<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.320> spindle

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
catches the thread between the spindle

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.040 
catches the thread between the spindle
and<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.160> bobbin<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.730> that's<00:01:25.390> what<00:01:25.660> makes<00:01:25.870> the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
and the bobbin and that's what makes the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.610 
and the bobbin and that's what makes the
whole<00:01:26.200> winding<00:01:27.040> mechanism<00:01:27.450> function<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:29.260> make

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
whole winding mechanism function so make

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.180 
whole winding mechanism function so make
sure<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.310> your<00:01:30.490> thread<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.000> there<00:01:31.630> and

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
sure that your thread is there and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.210 
sure that your thread is there and
through<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.370> needle<00:01:33.700> guide<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.560> screw<00:01:35.950> here

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
through the needle guide this screw here

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.149 
through the needle guide this screw here
is<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.540> amount<00:01:37.930> of<00:01:38.080> under<00:01:38.890> threat

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
is to just the amount of under threat

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.180 
is to just the amount of under threat
you<00:01:39.460> have<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.940> your<00:01:40.180> bobbin<00:01:40.390> make<00:01:41.350> sure<00:01:41.680> that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
you have on your bobbin make sure that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.640 
you have on your bobbin make sure that
this<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.640> set<00:01:42.850> correctly<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:44.020> don't<00:01:44.050> want<00:01:44.500> to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
this is set correctly you don't want to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.950 
this is set correctly you don't want to
over<00:01:45.190> wind<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.880> bobbin<00:01:46.060> otherwise<00:01:46.690> you'll

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
over wind the bobbin otherwise you'll

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.140 
over wind the bobbin otherwise you'll
have<00:01:47.020> problems<00:01:47.620> using<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.940> don't

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
have problems using it and you don't

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.760 
have problems using it and you don't
want<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:49.420> under<00:01:49.780> wind<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.200> because<00:01:50.530> then

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
want to under wind it because then

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.690 
want to under wind it because then
you're<00:01:50.950> just<00:01:51.040> going<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.520> keep

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
you're just going to have to keep

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.690 
you're just going to have to keep
changing<00:01:51.940> bobbins<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:54.159> here<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:54.640> is

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
changing bobbins this one here this is

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.420 
changing bobbins this one here this is
the<00:01:54.850> sensor<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:56.110> tells<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.860> Machine<00:01:57.220> when

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
the sensor that tells the Machine when

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.840 
the sensor that tells the Machine when
your<00:01:57.580> bobbin<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.060> round<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:59.370> it<00:02:00.370> lets<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
your bobbin is round and it lets the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.300 
your bobbin is round and it lets the
bobbin<00:02:01.180> release<00:02:01.870> and<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.830> bobbin<00:02:03.159> is

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
bobbin release and when the bobbin is

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.130 
bobbin release and when the bobbin is
released<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.940> comes<00:02:04.270> down<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.570> bottom<00:02:04.930> here

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
released it comes down the bottom here

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.089 
released it comes down the bottom here
and<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.560> new<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:06.720> inserted<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.709> I'm<00:02:08.920> just

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
and a new one is inserted so I'm just

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.160 
and a new one is inserted so I'm just
going<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.429> show<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.729> how<00:02:10.569> this<00:02:10.750> operation

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
going to show you how this operation

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.559 
going to show you how this operation
works<00:02:11.530> now<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.100> is<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> first<00:02:12.580> time<00:02:12.970> that

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
works now this is the first time that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.070 
works now this is the first time that
you<00:02:13.690> feed<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.230> machine

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
you feed the machine

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320 
you feed the machine
after<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.650> fed<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:15.950> as<00:02:16.250> long<00:02:16.850> as<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.150> keep

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330

this<00:02:43.070> your<00:02:43.610> bobbin<00:02:44.090> will<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.600> wind<00:02:44.900> correctly

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
this your bobbin will not wind correctly

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.990 
this your bobbin will not wind correctly
okay<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.060> we<00:02:47.210> just<00:02:48.370> notice<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> little<00:02:49.700> bit<00:02:49.820> move

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000

automatically<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:56.240> we<00:02:56.390> push<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.160> spindle

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
on to automatic but I'll leave this down

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.830 
on to automatic but I'll leave this down
for<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.140> minute<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.920> see<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.840> process
