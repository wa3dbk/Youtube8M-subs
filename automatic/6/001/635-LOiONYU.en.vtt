this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.840> beaker<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.319> water<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.920> it<00:00:02.129> looks

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
this is a beaker of water and it looks

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.919 
this is a beaker of water and it looks
like<00:00:02.310> there's<00:00:02.610> nothing<00:00:02.939> in<00:00:03.060> there<00:00:03.300> but<00:00:03.480> when<00:00:03.899> I

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
like there's nothing in there but when I

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.950 
like there's nothing in there but when I
put<00:00:04.170> my<00:00:04.200> hand<00:00:04.680> into<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.069> beaker<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.430> water<00:00:05.460> I

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
put my hand into the beaker of water I

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.049 
put my hand into the beaker of water I
pull<00:00:06.960> these<00:00:07.109> objects<00:00:07.770> out<00:00:07.950> these<00:00:08.490> objects<00:00:08.910> are

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
pull these objects out these objects are

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.150 
pull these objects out these objects are
called<00:00:09.179> jelly<00:00:09.570> marbles<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.800> special

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
called jelly marbles and the special

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.669 
called jelly marbles and the special
thing<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.340> jelly<00:00:12.030> marbles<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.440> they

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
thing about jelly marbles is that they

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
thing about jelly marbles is that they
have<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> same<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:15.030> refract<00:00:15.480> light<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
have the same they refract light the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380 
have the same they refract light the
same<00:00:16.289> way<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.830> water<00:00:17.160> does<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.880> when<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.270> are

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
same way as water does so when they are

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.599 
same way as water does so when they are
in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> water<00:00:19.039> it<00:00:20.039> looks<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.400> there's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
in the water it looks like there's

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.029 
in the water it looks like there's
nothing<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> water<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.260> refracting

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
nothing in the water because refracting

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
nothing in the water because refracting
the<00:00:23.279> light<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.720> same<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.350> water<00:00:25.590> does

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the light the same way that water does

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.580 
the light the same way that water does
this<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> look<00:00:27.060> at<00:00:27.240> them<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.660> close<00:00:27.900> even

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.010 

closer<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.940> can't<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.570> tell<00:00:33.870> at

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
closer of you you can't really tell at

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
closer of you you can't really tell at
all<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.460> see

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
all that they are in there you can see

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.780 
all that they are in there you can see
my<00:00:35.760> fingers<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.800> nothing<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.100> until<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> raise

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
my fingers but nothing but until I raise

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
my fingers but nothing but until I raise
them<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:40.680> looks<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.040> there's<00:00:41.250> nothing

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
them up it looks like there's nothing

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.209 
them up it looks like there's nothing
there<00:00:41.809> it's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.110> neat<00:00:43.350> demo<00:00:43.739> for

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
there it's a really neat demo for

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.049 
there it's a really neat demo for
demonstrating<00:00:45.210> ion<00:00:46.170> light<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> lens<00:00:47.760> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
demonstrating ion light that the lens of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
demonstrating ion light that the lens of
the<00:00:48.629> eyeball<00:00:49.289> refracts<00:00:49.860> light<00:00:52.579> taking<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the eyeball refracts light taking a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
the eyeball refracts light taking a
laser<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.890> running<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> through<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.340> jelly

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
laser and running it through the jelly

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.689 
laser and running it through the jelly
marble<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.309> run<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
marble and as you can see if we run the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
marble and as you can see if we run the
laser<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.440> bottom<00:01:01.770> side<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.699> jelly

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
laser at the bottom side of the jelly

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.590 
laser at the bottom side of the jelly
marble<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.290> light<00:01:05.220> gets<00:01:05.460> refracted<00:01:05.820> upwards

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
marble the light gets refracted upwards

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.160 
marble the light gets refracted upwards
when<00:01:07.350> laser<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.790> run<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> top<00:01:09.869> part

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
when laser is run through the top part

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.700 
when laser is run through the top part
of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.340> jelly<00:01:11.610> marble<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.960> laser<00:01:13.229> gets

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of the jelly marble the laser gets

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.880 
of the jelly marble the laser gets
refracted<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> downward<00:01:15.270> path<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
refracted in a downward path this is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
refracted in a downward path this is
similar<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.850> eyeball<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> lens<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
similar to the eyeball of the lens the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
similar to the eyeball of the lens the
eyeball<00:01:19.350> ends<00:01:19.680> light<00:01:20.549> beams<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.270> through

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
eyeball ends light beams will go through

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
eyeball ends light beams will go through
the<00:01:21.869> lens<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.799> exact<00:01:23.100> same<00:01:23.340> manner<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the lens in the exact same manner and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
the lens in the exact same manner and
we'll<00:01:24.150> focus<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> eyeball

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
we'll focus on the back of the eyeball

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
we'll focus on the back of the eyeball
on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.400> end<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.850> put<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.299> hand<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
on the right end I put my hand in the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649 
on the right end I put my hand in the
back<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.920> exactly<00:01:29.659> how

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
back there so you can see exactly how

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.230 
back there so you can see exactly how
where<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.710> end<00:01:32.040> point<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.420> laser<00:01:33.750> path<00:01:34.650> is

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
where the end point of the laser path is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
where the end point of the laser path is
so<00:01:36.240> again<00:01:36.770> when<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.979> laser<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.659> shown<00:01:39.890> when<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so again when the laser is shown when it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
so again when the laser is shown when it
goes<00:01:41.159> through<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.579> top<00:01:41.850> part<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> gets

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
goes through the top part and gets

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.410 
goes through the top part and gets
refracted<00:01:43.079> downward<00:01:43.799> path<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.399> when<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
refracted downward path and when the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.800 
refracted downward path and when the
laser<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:46.439> aimed<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.670> bottom<00:01:48.149> part<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
laser is aimed at the bottom part of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.260 
laser is aimed at the bottom part of the
lens<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.350> gets<00:01:49.829> refracted<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.820> upward<00:01:51.270> path

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
lens it gets refracted in an upward path

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.059 
lens it gets refracted in an upward path
and<00:01:53.270> I'm<00:01:53.359> changing<00:01:53.600> laser<00:01:54.079> beams<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:54.740> it

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
and I'm changing laser beams so that it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.569 
and I'm changing laser beams so that it
shines<00:01:55.549> in<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:56.390> continuous<00:01:56.929> flat<00:01:57.649> beam<00:01:58.069> and

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
shines in one continuous flat beam and

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.300 
shines in one continuous flat beam and
I'm<00:01:58.999> gonna<00:01:59.149> pass<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.479> over<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.079> jelly<00:02:00.799> marble

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
I'm gonna pass it over the jelly marble

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.370 
I'm gonna pass it over the jelly marble
and<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.119> see<00:02:02.390> how<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.689> path<00:02:03.049> gets

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
and you can see how the path gets

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.709 
and you can see how the path gets
interrupted<00:02:03.710> that's<00:02:04.189> because<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.450> jelly

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
interrupted that's because the jelly

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.559 
interrupted that's because the jelly
marble<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.590> refracting<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.310> light<00:02:07.569> whereas

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
marble is refracting the light whereas

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.130 
marble is refracting the light whereas
in<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.080> air<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.789> being<00:02:11.239> refracted<00:02:11.930> in

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
in the air it is not being refracted in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:21.330 
in the air it is not being refracted in
the<00:02:12.349> same<00:02:12.590> way

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.890 

the<00:02:22.340> laser<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.730> now<00:02:22.879> being<00:02:23.239> shown<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the laser is now being shown in a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.729 
the laser is now being shown in a
different<00:02:23.930> path<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.970> again<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.170> flat

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
different path and again the the flat

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.380 
different path and again the the flat
line<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> laser<00:02:28.549> is<00:02:28.879> going<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.239> be

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
line of the laser is going to be

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.960 
line of the laser is going to be
interrupted<00:02:30.080> by<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.349> jelly<00:02:31.190> marble<00:02:31.610> because

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
interrupted by the jelly marble because

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.780 
interrupted by the jelly marble because
the<00:02:32.150> jelly<00:02:32.360> marble<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.019> refracting<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.860> laser

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the jelly marble is refracting the laser

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.600 
the jelly marble is refracting the laser
light<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> different<00:02:36.040> way<00:02:37.040> or<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> different

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
light at a different way or a different

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.039 
light at a different way or a different
angle<00:02:37.760> then<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.650> air<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:40.629> it's<00:02:41.629> kind<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.900> neat

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
angle then the air is it's kind of neat

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.910 
angle then the air is it's kind of neat
looking<00:02:42.410> at<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.180> seeing<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.590> two<00:02:45.590> different

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
looking at this seeing the two different

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.339 
looking at this seeing the two different
paths<00:02:46.099> kind<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:47.360> know<00:02:47.450> one<00:02:47.750> not<00:02:48.019> in<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
paths kind of you know one not in the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.170 
paths kind of you know one not in the
marble<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:48.920> going<00:02:49.430> through<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.700> marble<00:02:50.030> it's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
marble one going through the marble it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:01.750 
marble one going through the marble it's
kind<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.420> cool<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.690> see<00:03:00.129> here<00:03:01.129> are<00:03:01.250> three<00:03:01.519> jelly

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
kind of cool to see here are three jelly

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.720 
kind of cool to see here are three jelly
marbles<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.450> we're<00:03:02.599> going<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.750> put<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.730> flat

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
marbles and we're going to put that flat

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.539 
marbles and we're going to put that flat
laser<00:03:05.090> light<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:06.049> shine<00:03:06.769> down<00:03:07.010> on<00:03:07.190> them<00:03:07.310> and

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
laser light and shine down on them and

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.160 
laser light and shine down on them and
again<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.879> can<00:03:08.090> see<00:03:08.269> how<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.510> straight<00:03:08.989> line

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
again you can see how the straight line

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.250 
again you can see how the straight line
is<00:03:09.349> being<00:03:09.530> broken<00:03:09.769> up<00:03:10.069> by<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.180> jelly<00:03:11.780> marbles

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
is being broken up by the jelly marbles

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.619 
is being broken up by the jelly marbles
and<00:03:13.010> again<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> jelly<00:03:13.640> marbles<00:03:14.060> refracting

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
and again the jelly marbles refracting

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.059 
and again the jelly marbles refracting
the<00:03:14.660> light<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.290> different<00:03:15.620> way<00:03:15.709> than<00:03:15.920> the

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
the light in a different way than the

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.920 
the light in a different way than the
air<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:16.970> see<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.359> laser<00:03:17.810> light

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
air is so you can see the laser light

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.270 
air is so you can see the laser light
kind<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.170> being<00:03:18.349> broken<00:03:18.650> up<00:03:18.859> in<00:03:19.069> different

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
kind of being broken up in different

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.700 
kind of being broken up in different
parts
