before I started recording so I figured
why<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> hell<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.900> it'll<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.860> episode

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
why the hell not it'll make this episode

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.710 
why the hell not it'll make this episode
just<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:08.970> longer<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
just a little bit longer because this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.789 
just a little bit longer because this

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
one is going to be very short anyways

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.020 
one is going to be very short anyways
because<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:14.100> only<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.400> other<00:01:14.549> item<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of a lot easier with the Sprint well it

of them acid that helps acid is good for

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.420 
of them acid that helps acid is good for
a<00:01:47.100> few<00:01:47.280> things<00:01:47.659> mental<00:01:48.659> awareness<00:01:49.430> elevating

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
a few things mental awareness elevating

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.840 
a few things mental awareness elevating
yourself<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> higher<00:01:51.360> plane<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:52.850> elevated

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
yourself to a higher plane an elevated

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.319 
yourself to a higher plane an elevated
state<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> consciousness

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
state of consciousness

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.319 
state of consciousness
it's<00:01:56.899> not<00:01:57.109> good<00:01:57.320> for<00:01:57.350> measuring<00:01:57.680> or<00:01:58.520> Sammis<00:01:59.090> I

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
it's not good for measuring or Sammis I

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.340 
it's not good for measuring or Sammis I
don't<00:02:00.229> think<00:02:00.439> she<00:02:00.590> wants<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:00.950> higher<00:02:01.250> plane

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
don't think she wants that higher plane

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.709 
don't think she wants that higher plane
she<00:02:03.350> will<00:02:04.250> die<00:02:04.729> if<00:02:04.759> you're<00:02:05.179> trying<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.539> prove

crappy I think so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.390 
crappy I think so
but<00:03:14.750> first<00:03:14.960> we<00:03:15.140> definitely<00:03:15.680> need<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:15.950> recharge

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
but first we definitely need to recharge

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
I doubt well that's not the way to make

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.080 
I doubt well that's not the way to make
it<00:03:26.120> there<00:03:26.240> relatively<00:03:26.780> quickly<00:03:27.940> but<00:03:28.940> I'll

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090

the time is energy energy is life life
is<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.600> difference<00:03:56.989> between<00:03:57.220> fail<00:03:58.220> and

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
is the difference between fail and

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.910 
is the difference between fail and
victory<00:04:00.850> vote<00:04:01.850> life<00:04:02.120> dude<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:03.440> gotta<00:04:03.650> have

thing<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:36.290> got<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.470> be<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> fire<00:04:36.890> I<00:04:36.919> don't

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
thing is it's got to be a fire I don't

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.159 
thing is it's got to be a fire I don't
know<00:04:37.280> how<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> fireball<00:04:38.090> could<00:04:38.300> be<00:04:38.419> inside<00:04:38.960> the

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
know how a fireball could be inside the

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.640 
know how a fireball could be inside the
lava<00:04:39.380> but<00:04:40.330> who<00:04:41.330> am<00:04:41.479> I<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.660> question<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.500> logic

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
lava but who am I to question the logic

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.090 
lava but who am I to question the logic

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
who probably shouldn't even be help me

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.370 
who probably shouldn't even be help me
I'm<00:04:49.430> not<00:04:49.490> very<00:04:49.850> good<00:04:49.940> at<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.419> although<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.260> do

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
I'm not very good at it although I do

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.590 
I'm not very good at it although I do
have<00:04:51.680> my<00:04:51.919> moments

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
have my moments

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.700 
have my moments
indeed<00:04:53.600> how<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:55.160> was<00:04:55.310> not<00:04:55.520> one<00:04:55.729> of<00:04:55.760> them

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
indeed how that was not one of them

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.410 
indeed how that was not one of them
those<00:04:57.710> things<00:04:57.979> look<00:04:58.160> like

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
those things look like

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.800 
those things look like
I<00:05:00.490> could<00:05:01.490> see<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.790> resemblance<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.660> the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
I could see a resemblance to the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.580 
I could see a resemblance to the
predator<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.530> those<00:05:03.710> no<00:05:04.430> just<00:05:05.030> think<00:05:05.270> about

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
predator and those no just think about

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.430 
predator and those no just think about
