we'll<00:00:11.250> do<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.490> we'll<00:00:11.639> take<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.480> hk416<00:00:13.170> we'll

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
we'll do is we'll take the hk416 we'll

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.369 
we'll do is we'll take the hk416 we'll
load<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.920> up<00:00:14.210> we'll<00:00:15.210> bury<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.809> sand<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
load this up we'll bury it with sand and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
load this up we'll bury it with sand and
then<00:00:16.710> it'll<00:00:17.310> pull<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.699> out<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> sand

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
then it'll pull it up out of the sand

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450 
then it'll pull it up out of the sand
and<00:00:18.359> shoot<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> target<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.830> right<00:00:19.949> bro<00:00:20.130> go<00:00:20.279> at

reputation for reliability but it is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.600

your<00:01:10.260> internals<00:01:10.770> you're<00:01:11.460> keeping<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> sand

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
your internals you're keeping the sand

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:31.020 
your internals you're keeping the sand
out<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.630> those<00:01:12.780> areas

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.680 

very<00:01:32.030> nice

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
very nice

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.490 
very nice
clear<00:01:33.700> well<00:01:34.700> done<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.330> know<00:01:35.900> one<00:01:36.259> of<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.470> things

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
clear well done I know one of the things

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.280 
clear well done I know one of the things
early<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:38.030> TV<00:01:38.420> viewers<00:01:38.750> might<00:01:38.960> find<00:01:39.200> this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
early on that TV viewers might find this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.969 
early on that TV viewers might find this
interesting

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
interesting

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.789 
interesting
when<00:01:40.400> they<00:01:40.490> first<00:01:40.700> were<00:01:40.880> doing<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.590> 416<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
when they first were doing the 416 to

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.560 
when they first were doing the 416 to
time<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.220> was<00:01:43.280> called<00:01:43.490> HK<00:01:43.880> m4

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
time it was called HK m4

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.230 
time it was called HK m4
they<00:01:44.990> had<00:01:45.110> some<00:01:45.380> issues<00:01:45.530> with<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.009> spring<00:01:46.880> up

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
they had some issues with the spring up

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.790 
they had some issues with the spring up
there<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.720> getting<00:01:47.990> debris<00:01:48.350> in<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.710> they

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
there and getting debris in it so they

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.530 
there and getting debris in it so they
had<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.040> come<00:01:49.220> up<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.759> correct<00:01:50.090> spring

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
had to come up with the correct spring

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.990 
had to come up with the correct spring
coils<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.560> debris<00:01:51.890> did<00:01:52.280> not<00:01:52.460> affect<00:01:52.909> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
coils so that debris did not affect the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.710 
coils so that debris did not affect the
pusher<00:01:53.330> rod

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
pusher rod

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.180 
pusher rod
yeah<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.200> could<00:01:54.380> very<00:01:54.710> well<00:01:54.740> be<00:01:54.890> possible

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
yeah it could very well be possible

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.550 
yeah it could very well be possible
obviously<00:01:55.790> they<00:01:56.180> fix<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.659> long<00:01:56.930> time<00:01:57.200> ago

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
obviously they fix that a long time ago

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.230 
obviously they fix that a long time ago
gun<00:01:58.040> runs<00:01:58.250> like<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.430> champ<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.850> course<00:01:59.090> we

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
gun runs like a champ of course we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.630 
gun runs like a champ of course we
expect<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.899> do<00:02:00.020> exactly<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.560> trip<00:02:00.890> well

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
expect it to do exactly the trip well

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.530

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
about the hk416 operating system Robbie

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.199 
about the hk416 operating system Robbie
basically<00:02:16.310> what<00:02:16.459> we're<00:02:16.580> going<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:16.850> here<00:02:17.090> is

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
basically what we're going to do here is

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.970 
basically what we're going to do here is
we're<00:02:17.720> going<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.900> remove<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.830> rail

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
we're going to remove the the rail

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.920 
we're going to remove the the rail
system<00:02:19.220> off<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.700> front<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.060> gun<00:02:20.239> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
system off the front of the gun to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.770 
system off the front of the gun to
expose<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.920> inner<00:02:22.580> workings<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.360> gas

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
expose the inner workings of the gas

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.990 
expose the inner workings of the gas
piston<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.860> operating<00:02:25.370> rod<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.880> can

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
piston and the operating rod so we can

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.340 
piston and the operating rod so we can
actually<00:02:26.150> show<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.540> how<00:02:26.630> that's<00:02:27.110> actually
