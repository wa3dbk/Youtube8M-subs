00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.689
 world 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 purposes and I 'm glad to be there this 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.130

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.479
 seeing you sleep 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.460
 the curl of hair around your 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.850
 ear the moment the precious moment 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.990
 taillieu open and I have at gt 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.240
 eagerly I went to see a little 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.119
 how was it like you said it was 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.930
 not the town hall of palavas the waves what 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.750
 that's wonderful 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.380
 so here it is there is something 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.180
 flamboyant in the room I hope he 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.180
 there will be also on stage of the flamboyant 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.509
 such a monument 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.509
 I come 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.470
 but 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 no 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 Paris 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.310
 no more 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.330
 I will transform the German guitar 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.060
 if I ever had you chari 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.430
 choose a supernatural power and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.430
 transform the halls 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:20.010
 I do not know why tonight but 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.540
 I only think of seeing you old I have 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.150
 a lot of difficulty with the idea of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.519
 rituals because it ends up by 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.230
 blush and I'm still trying even in 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.090
 my daily life killing rituals 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.260
 I never get up at the same time I 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.970
 a job that allows me to do that but 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.959
 but I try to be in something 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.489
 who is always in the discovery of the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.489
 little moment made between 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.280
 auxerre I'm crazy 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.280
 I am really happy to be 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.549
 did it really when I played with my 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.659
 father here here I just appeared on 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.670
 end of the song but I keep it 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.690
 really a very accurate memory because 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.700
 that I remember kindness 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.209
 from the audience and I remember having 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.889
 really had a good time and that's it 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.010
 so I'm very excited to be the 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.669
 alone and come play performer for 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.669

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.550
 m 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.550
 and 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.520
 me what matters to me the most 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.080
 before creation during the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.060
 project development is to know 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.260
 if the artists I took back that I 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.400
 reworking is what they liked 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.110
 is that what denature is 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.450
 not too much the piece had that returns 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.770
 positive and also negative and but 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.850
 today rota negatives more than at 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.020
