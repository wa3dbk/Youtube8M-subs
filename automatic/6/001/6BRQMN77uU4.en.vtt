00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
like the Year 2313 you die when you get

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.870 
like the Year 2313 you die when you get
hit<00:04:30.590> with<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.770> single<00:04:31.130> bullet<00:04:31.250> like<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.760> is

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
hit with a single bullet like that is

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.480 
hit with a single bullet like that is
how<00:04:32.000> far<00:04:32.300> space<00:04:32.720> warfare<00:04:33.020> has<00:04:33.410> come<00:04:33.620> maybe

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
how far space warfare has come maybe

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.760 
how far space warfare has come maybe
this<00:04:34.730> is<00:04:34.880> like<00:04:35.090> literally<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:36.020> first<00:04:36.260> space

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
this is like literally the first space

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.290 
this is like literally the first space
battle<00:04:37.690> like<00:04:38.690> outside<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.940> prototype<00:04:40.940> you

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
battle like outside of prototype you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.290 
battle like outside of prototype you
know<00:04:41.480> war<00:04:42.200> games<00:04:42.790> you're<00:04:43.790> saying<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
know war games you're saying this is the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.440 
know war games you're saying this is the
first<00:04:44.630> ever<00:04:45.020> galactic<00:04:45.650> battle<00:04:45.980> it<00:04:46.910> could<00:04:47.240> be

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
first ever galactic battle it could be

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.630 
first ever galactic battle it could be
what<00:04:47.990> about<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.710> history<00:04:49.040> books<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.490> tell

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
what about the history books that tell

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.310 
what about the history books that tell
us<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:50.120> long<00:04:50.660> time<00:04:50.930> ago<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.800> galaxy<00:04:51.830> far<00:04:52.310> away

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
us a long time ago in a galaxy far away

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.510 
us a long time ago in a galaxy far away
there<00:04:54.320> was<00:04:54.410> something<00:04:54.740> similar<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.100> just<00:04:55.370> that

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
there was something similar to just that

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.630 
there was something similar to just that
happens<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:57.020> was<00:04:57.140> but<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.890> was<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.550> a

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
happens that was but that was in a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.920 
happens that was but that was in a
different<00:04:58.850> galaxy<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:01.610> saying<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.360> don't

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
different galaxy you saying I I don't

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
different galaxy you saying I I don't
even<00:05:02.990> know<00:05:03.230> what<00:05:03.320> you're<00:05:03.380> saying<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:03.800> don't

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
think that was in the Milky Way I just

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.770 
think that was in the Milky Way I just
gotta<00:05:08.300> say<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.570> like<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.260> camera<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.970> by

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
gotta say it like the camera it is by

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.360 
gotta say it like the camera it is by
far<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.110> worst<00:05:12.470> thing<00:05:12.680> in<00:05:12.800> this<00:05:12.890> game<00:05:13.070> but<00:05:13.250> I'm

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
far the worst thing in this game but I'm

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.430 
far the worst thing in this game but I'm
getting<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.670> great<00:05:13.940> shot<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.510> you<00:05:15.380> know

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
getting a great shot of the you know

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.550 
getting a great shot of the you know
exhaust<00:05:16.390> mechanism<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.540> exhaust<00:05:17.870> apparatus

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
exhaust mechanism the exhaust apparatus

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.400 
exhaust mechanism the exhaust apparatus
on<00:05:18.680> our<00:05:18.830> ship<00:05:19.040> here<00:05:19.280> yeah<00:05:19.730> where<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.180> can<00:05:20.330> see

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
on our ship here yeah where you can see

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.110 
on our ship here yeah where you can see
literally<00:05:21.410> zero<00:05:21.890> emissions<00:05:22.490> that's<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:22.940> one

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
literally zero emissions that's the one

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.180 
literally zero emissions that's the one
thing<00:05:23.420> they've<00:05:24.080> accomplished<00:05:24.710> in<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:24.920> game

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
thing they've accomplished in this game

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.000 
thing they've accomplished in this game
I'm<00:05:26.120> gonna<00:05:26.330> throw<00:05:26.600> up<00:05:26.630> this<00:05:27.410> is<00:05:27.680> zero

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
I'm gonna throw up this is zero

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.730 
I'm gonna throw up this is zero
emissions<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.840> were<00:05:30.020> not<00:05:30.200> polluting<00:05:30.650> in

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
emissions so you were not polluting in

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.530 
emissions so you were not polluting in
the<00:05:30.830> vastness<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.370> space<00:05:31.760> which<00:05:32.510> is

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
the vastness of space which is

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.180 
the vastness of space which is
remarkable<00:05:32.990> because<00:05:33.350> apparently<00:05:33.860> according

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
remarkable because apparently according

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.280 
remarkable because apparently according
to<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.460> story<00:05:34.730> we<00:05:34.940> polluted<00:05:35.450> so<00:05:35.660> much<00:05:35.900> that

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
to the story we polluted so much that

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.340 
to the story we polluted so much that
the<00:05:36.680> earth<00:05:36.800> is<00:05:36.980> unusable<00:05:37.510> yeah<00:05:38.510> you<00:05:39.020> know<00:05:39.140> if

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
the earth is unusable yeah you know if

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.750 
the earth is unusable yeah you know if
you<00:05:39.440> look<00:05:39.620> at<00:05:39.800> it<00:05:39.830> from<00:05:40.040> space<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.340> actually

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
you look at it from space it actually

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.210 
you look at it from space it actually
doesn't<00:05:40.910> look<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.120> bad<00:05:41.830> looks<00:05:42.830> it<00:05:43.100> looks

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
doesn't look that bad looks it looks

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.430 
doesn't look that bad looks it looks
just<00:05:43.610> as<00:05:43.730> blue<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.690> kind<00:05:45.020> of<00:05:45.080> looks<00:05:45.140> like<00:05:45.320> a

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
just as blue that kind of looks like a

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.590 
just as blue that kind of looks like a
picture<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.950> google<00:05:46.250> earth<00:05:46.430> that<00:05:47.270> would<00:05:47.480> have

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
picture of google earth that would have

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.740 
picture of google earth that would have
been<00:05:47.690> taken<00:05:47.930> sometimes<00:05:48.800> it's<00:05:48.950> years<00:05:49.750> although

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
been taken sometimes it's years although

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.450 
been taken sometimes it's years although
I'm<00:05:50.900> sure<00:05:50.930> that's<00:05:51.440> not<00:05:51.620> what<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:51.950> designers

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
I'm sure that's not what the designers

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.280 
I'm sure that's not what the designers
did<00:05:53.860> doubtful<00:05:54.860> Kirk<00:05:55.310> highly<00:05:55.730> doubtful<00:05:56.290> you

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
did doubtful Kirk highly doubtful you

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.780 
did doubtful Kirk highly doubtful you
really<00:05:57.500> did<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.680> good<00:05:57.800> job<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:58.040> animating<00:05:58.669> the

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
really did a good job of animating the

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.700 
really did a good job of animating the
the<00:05:59.060> bleakness<00:05:59.360> of<00:05:59.600> space<00:05:59.900> I<00:06:00.200> really<00:06:00.500> feel

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
the bleakness of space I really feel

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.040 
the bleakness of space I really feel
like<00:06:00.740> all<00:06:01.250> hope<00:06:01.850> is<00:06:02.000> lost<00:06:02.030> when<00:06:02.480> I<00:06:02.600> stare<00:06:02.870> into

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
like all hope is lost when I stare into

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.159 
like all hope is lost when I stare into
that<00:06:03.200> of<00:06:03.470> this<00:06:03.740> I<00:06:04.360> mean<00:06:05.360> just<00:06:05.390> look<00:06:05.810> at<00:06:05.960> each

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
that of this I mean just look at each

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.350 
that of this I mean just look at each
one<00:06:06.260> of<00:06:06.500> those<00:06:06.680> galaxies<00:06:07.430> in<00:06:07.730> the<00:06:07.850> distance

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
one of those galaxies in the distance

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
really well at least the spaceship as

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.320 
really well at least the spaceship as
well<00:06:42.139> rendered<00:06:42.499> it's<00:06:42.709> just<00:06:42.860> the<00:06:42.949> biggest

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
well rendered it's just the biggest

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.029 
well rendered it's just the biggest
problems<00:06:44.330> obvious<00:06:44.959> is<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.139> camera<00:06:45.709> and<00:06:46.009> the

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:51.259 
feedback in terms of damage and it does

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.859 
feedback in terms of damage and it does
