00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
collector as well he was very very

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.169 
collector as well he was very very
focused<00:01:17.619> on<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.950> details<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.789> somber

figure<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.799> know<00:01:20.859> he<00:01:21.159> would<00:01:21.369> sit<00:01:21.579> for

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
figure you know he would sit for

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.499 
figure you know he would sit for
probably<00:01:22.679> hours<00:01:23.679> I<00:01:23.950> think<00:01:24.159> with<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.429> guys<00:01:24.609> who

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
probably hours I think with the guys who

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.760 
probably hours I think with the guys who
actually<00:01:25.929> built<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.530> know<00:01:26.619> actually

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
actually built you know actually

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.980 
actually built you know actually
constructed<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.549> figure<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.479> giving<00:01:28.869> them

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
constructed the figure just giving them

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.160 
constructed the figure just giving them
feedback<00:01:29.200> on<00:01:29.710> every<00:01:30.429> single<00:01:30.880> little<00:01:31.749> detail

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
feedback on every single little detail

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.399 
feedback on every single little detail
in<00:01:32.829> a<00:01:32.979> way<00:01:33.189> that<00:01:33.399> probably<00:01:34.170> probably<00:01:35.170> drove

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
in a way that probably probably drove

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.319 
in a way that probably probably drove
those<00:01:35.619> guys<00:01:35.829> a<00:01:35.859> little<00:01:36.219> bit<00:01:36.340> insane<00:01:36.729> but<00:01:37.149> you

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
those guys a little bit insane but you

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.209 
those guys a little bit insane but you
know<00:01:37.479> I<00:01:37.899> think<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.409> that's<00:01:38.560> important

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
know I think that that's important

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.359 
know I think that that's important
because<00:01:39.399> of<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.329> day<00:01:40.539> I'd<00:01:41.289> rather<00:01:41.530> have<00:01:41.979> us<00:01:42.009> be

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
because of the day I'd rather have us be

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.800 
because of the day I'd rather have us be
insane<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.939> have<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.210> people<00:01:43.450> making<00:01:43.659> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
insane and have the people making the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.940 
insane and have the people making the
finger<00:01:44.049> be<00:01:44.170> insane<00:01:44.499> so<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.799> gamer<00:01:45.219> gets

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
finger be insane so the gamer gets

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:57.790 
finger be insane so the gamer gets
Oh<00:01:46.009> something<00:01:46.729> great

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800
