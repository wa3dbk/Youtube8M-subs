00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello, I want to talk on the topic 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.320
 how to shrink your cheeks and make your cheekbones 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.599
 the relief is not like that, as you understood 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.260
 about dry correction blush 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.240
 but there are two main mistakes first 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.630
 it chooses the wrong shade of blush 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.910
 the second is not there to put it and the third 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.609
 incorrectly shading about 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 shades, I'm talking about rouge 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.399
 similar shades ie it 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 gray-brown gamma what is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.270
 mistake choose either too brick 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.550
 or 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 pink hue that is needed for 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.039
 blush here these counter and puts it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.920
 to the school zone here the school zone should 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.480
 be 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.850
 neutral tones which will be approximately 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.579
 as our natural shadow, let's say 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 even what I showed you the magician harmony 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 and vivienne sabo 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.500
 paletochka more with pink blush I 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.659
 I hope frames there can be seen cheaper by 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.090
 years goes by 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.700
 a brownish tint runs brick to him 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.010
 make harmony is coming 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 pinkish gray and since we put we 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.360
 we take a fluffy brush I put and such 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.979
 and so much more and preferably beveled 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 sometimes in extreme cases I even 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.130
 powder brush too I can calmly 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.409
 apply blush to myself quite a bit 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 I beat it in our hands so that in no way 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.759
 there was no stain before 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.159
 apply dry blush necessarily 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.829
 we put powder to make everything good for us 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.890
 shade this area here 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.380
 about us from the middle of the ear to the corner 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.149
 lips can be a little pull in 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 fish everlasting our movement and put on 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.340
 here and immediately blend this area 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.640
 up and down 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.680
 most error still up somehow 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.430
 shading about them for some reason 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.190
 forget 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.039
 when we stand at the sides just in this zone 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.500
 very clearly visible we shade here 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.530
 this little corner here we drive in hair shade 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.130
 that's right in the stew tassel not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:25.170
 there was a transition of white and forehead necessarily 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.290
 but who has it high there necessarily 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.100
 wing is normally proportioned there it can be so 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.890
 and of course not to do but we burst not pass 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.950
 along the strip we smooth these 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.530
 corners the same here zone no 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 In no case can you see a strip. 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.090
 smooth gently and reduce so your 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.550
 counters but who they have the same 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.440
 the very second side is the beauty 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.510
 such a shade something that even if you 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.820
 take too much or too much 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.660
 time you will not be some 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.510
 intense color home lift in bright 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.830
 orange or pink for the final 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.620
 take a light powder and walk on here 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.769
 these frontal zones which should 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:23.490
 us to be as light as possible 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:28.010
 the triangles wears a little pilot 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:31.860
 and at the end we add that highlighter for 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.300
 highlighter i take in inglot the shadows here 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:40.980
 peach beige and put myself 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.640
 but this amount that is in fact 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.320
 go the usual topic but the main thing is not 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.880
 overdo it so that there is no solid 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.670
 highlight on ours and here's a brush 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.570
 possible with your fingers but these shadows will be difficult 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.440
 you put 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.870
 and then she lies down easily and it turns out 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.290
 here is this mysterious 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.590
 black can be a little bit on skin 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.590
 fat secret advice on from the good guys 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.470
 I also know for sure in inglot is cool 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.970
 russia sculpture rouge kevin coyne on 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.900
 this is a more expensive segment for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.739
 professionals 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.230
 and I don't know anything simpler, that 's why 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.170
 just the theme of sculpture chewing blush in 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.820
 mass market it is not disclosed if you 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.830
 you know something interesting necessarily 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.840
 write in the comments I'm only with 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.920
 will be considered a joy if something is removed 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.920
