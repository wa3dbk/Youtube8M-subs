shirt<00:01:16.689> like<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.259> takes<00:01:17.890> about<00:01:18.040> 200<00:01:18.759> gallons

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
shirt like this takes about 200 gallons

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.510 
shirt like this takes about 200 gallons
of<00:01:19.270> water<00:01:19.329> to<00:01:19.600> color<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.770> water<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.159> full

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
of water to color and that water is full

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.420 
of water to color and that water is full
of<00:01:21.670> toxic<00:01:22.119> chemicals<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:22.750> cause<00:01:22.899> cancer

of toxic chemicals that cause cancer

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.950 
of toxic chemicals that cause cancer
therefore<00:01:24.430> we<00:01:24.670> can't<00:01:24.939> bring<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.540> kind<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
therefore we can't bring this kind of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.740 
therefore we can't bring this kind of
technology<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.560> manufacturing<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:28.360> mass

production back to the United States

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.850 
production back to the United States
because<00:01:31.719> we<00:01:31.899> would<00:01:32.020> use<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.380> water<00:01:32.590> and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
because we would use the water and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.980 
because we would use the water and
poison<00:01:33.729> what<00:01:34.030> was<00:01:34.240> left<00:01:36.869> actually<00:01:37.869> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
poison what was left actually the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.429 
poison what was left actually the
technology<00:01:38.380> was<00:01:38.920> developed<00:01:40.170> while<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.229> was

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
technology was developed while I was

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.859 
technology was developed while I was
working<00:01:41.740> on<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.860> communications<00:01:42.640> job<00:01:42.909> instead

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
working on a communications job instead

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.770 
working on a communications job instead
of<00:01:44.020> on<00:01:44.170> an<00:01:44.350> apparel<00:01:44.799> job<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:46.149> discovery

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
of on an apparel job and the discovery

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.130 
of on an apparel job and the discovery
was<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.500> found<00:01:47.770> or<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.670> found<00:01:49.030> that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
was that we found or that I found that

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.170 
was that we found or that I found that
the<00:01:50.620> energy<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.340> was<00:01:51.490> needed<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.880> color

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
the energy that was needed to color

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.930 
the energy that was needed to color
fabric<00:01:52.840> or<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.230> color<00:01:53.410> fiber<00:01:53.800> was<00:01:54.550> actually

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
fabric or to color fiber was actually

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.630 
fabric or to color fiber was actually
stored<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.840> fiber<00:01:56.080> itself<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.160> all<00:01:57.490> you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
stored in the fiber itself and all you

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.060 
stored in the fiber itself and all you
had<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.850> do<00:01:58.090> was<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.630> release<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.770> instead

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
had to do was to release it so instead

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.650 
had to do was to release it so instead
of<00:02:00.130> using<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.670> force<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.270> we've<00:02:01.450> always

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
of using the force that we've always

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.800 
of using the force that we've always
used<00:02:01.780> since<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.220> Industrial<00:02:03.760> Revolution<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
used since the Industrial Revolution you

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.320 
used since the Industrial Revolution you
know<00:02:04.900> just<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.260> bigger<00:02:05.680> steam<00:02:06.070> engine<00:02:06.430> our

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
know just a bigger steam engine our

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.210 
know just a bigger steam engine our
approach<00:02:07.690> was<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.140> use<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:08.440> leverage<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:09.100> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
approach was to use the leverage of the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.889 
approach was to use the leverage of the
energy<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.640> was<00:02:09.880> stored<00:02:09.940> in<00:02:10.630> man-made

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
energy that was stored in man-made

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.460 
energy that was stored in man-made
fibers<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.850> release<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.720> order<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
fibers and to release that in order to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.280 
fibers and to release that in order to
pump<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.040> dye<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.460> using<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.480> fibers<00:02:16.870> energy

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
pump the dye in using the fibers energy

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.860 
pump the dye in using the fibers energy
itself<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.190> we<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:21.640> huge<00:02:22.000> tension<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
itself so we have this huge tension in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.830

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
product they can't sell and we end up

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.920 
product they can't sell and we end up
losing<00:02:36.730> money<00:02:36.850> at<00:02:37.090> both<00:02:37.270> ends<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:40.510> needed

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
losing money at both ends so we needed

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.840 
losing money at both ends so we needed
to<00:02:41.140> build<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.500> factory<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:42.520> could<00:02:42.700> go

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
to build a factory that could go

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.660

all that meant we couldn't have the

all those factors in advance so someone
