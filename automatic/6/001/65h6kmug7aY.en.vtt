00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.299
 hello with you vadim grandfather 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.639
 In this video tutorial I will teach you how to create 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.610
 animated gif picture using 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.860
 Internet service service in which we will 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.890
 do and in the picture allows you to create 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.650
 frame by frame animation 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.560
 pre-prepared pictures and then 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 save work in gif image format 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.480
 the number of frames of the finished animation gif 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 can be any but the more of them 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.929
 the amount the larger the file size 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.640
 skillful 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.920
 and moderate use of animation 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 significantly revive your pages and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.470
 will draw attention to anything and so 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.560
 we start to go to the service link 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.310
 opens a site where we will create gif 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.680
 picture 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.380
 Itâ€™s best to go from a google browser 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.890
 chrome it will automatically translate to 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.890
 Russian 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.780

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.200

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.200

 pictures must be the same size 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:13.729
 otherwise gif the picture will be with different 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:15.860
 formats and it will not be nice to open 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.270
