exact<00:01:50.909> science<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
exact science to this you can make it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.430 
exact science to this you can make it
stronger<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:53.579> putting<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.180> ginger<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.810> there
