millimeter<00:00:39.649> for<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:41.100> particular<00:00:42.050> screws

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
millimeter for these particular screws

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.209 
millimeter for these particular screws
there<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.600> approximately<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:46.739> three

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
there is approximately one two three

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.090 
there is approximately one two three
four<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:48.450> approximately<00:00:48.809> four<00:00:49.559> screws

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
four there's approximately four screws

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
four there's approximately four screws
which<00:00:50.730> holds<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.140> air<00:00:52.379> filter<00:00:53.780> casing<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
which holds on the air filter casing you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
which holds on the air filter casing you
have<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.350> remove<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> air<00:00:55.949> filter<00:00:56.190> casing

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have to remove the air filter casing

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.529 
have to remove the air filter casing
first<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.510> order<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.620> starter<00:00:59.539> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
first in order to get to the starter so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.990 
first in order to get to the starter so
right<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.699> I'm<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.910 
air filter casing and here we have the
starter<00:01:16.710> there's<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.759> starter<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.299> here

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
starter there's the starter right here

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
starter there's the starter right here
we<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> couple<00:01:20.340> bolts<00:01:21.049> one<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.320> there

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
we got a couple bolts one right there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
right back here so anyway basically if

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
right back here so anyway basically if
you<00:01:41.939> look<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> starter<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.350> figure<00:01:44.040> out

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you look at the starter and figure out

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
you look at the starter and figure out
where<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.030> how<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> goes<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.079> you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
where it you know how it goes in so you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.920 
where it you know how it goes in so you
got<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.579> front<00:01:47.850> part<00:01:48.240> which<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.899> here

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
got the front part which is right here

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
got the front part which is right here
and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:51.920> these<00:01:52.920> two<00:01:53.280> right

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and then you have to these two right

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.850 
and then you have to these two right
here<00:01:53.820> are<00:01:54.060> our<00:01:54.329> four<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
here are our four that is for the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
here are our four that is for the
connection<00:01:59.430> there's<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.659> there's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
connection there's one here and there's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.139 
connection there's one here and there's
one<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.310> put<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.610> exactly

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
one here they have to be put on exactly

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.959 
one here they have to be put on exactly
the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.219> course<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.909> is

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the same way and then of course this is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.160 
the same way and then of course this is
just<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.770> like<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> speaker<00:02:08.429> wire<00:02:08.670> type<00:02:09.379> dude

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
just like like a speaker wire type dude

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.339 
just like like a speaker wire type dude
you<00:02:11.349> just<00:02:11.590> pull<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.920> right<00:02:11.950> off<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.900> course

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.270 

I'm<00:02:17.349> going<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.550> take<00:02:18.970> off<00:02:19.150> these<00:02:19.360> screws<00:02:19.810> and
