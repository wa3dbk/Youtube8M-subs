00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
we've done their roles off the back of a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.050 
we've done their roles off the back of a
line<00:00:15.769> at<00:00:15.920> one<00:00:16.039> thing<00:00:16.279> we've<00:00:16.400> never<00:00:16.579> looked<00:00:16.789> at

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
line at one thing we've never looked at

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.450 
line at one thing we've never looked at
is<00:00:17.240> your<00:00:17.599> role<00:00:17.810> defensively<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.740> scrum<00:00:19.279> and

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
is your role defensively a scrum and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.370 
is your role defensively a scrum and
it's<00:00:19.820> quite<00:00:19.999> difficult<00:00:20.269> for<00:00:20.599> it<00:00:20.810> for<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.019> 7

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's quite difficult for it for the 7

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.290 
it's quite difficult for it for the 7
because<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.130> forwards<00:00:22.579> I<00:00:22.669> know<00:00:22.730> is<00:00:22.999> a<00:00:23.029> front

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
because the forwards I know is a front

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.999 
because the forwards I know is a front
five<00:00:23.509> perspective<00:00:24.019> you<00:00:24.319> want<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.650> weight<00:00:24.829> you

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
five perspective you want the weight you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.649 
five perspective you want the weight you
want<00:00:25.039> them<00:00:25.339> concentrating<00:00:25.939> on<00:00:25.999> the<00:00:26.119> scrum<00:00:26.419> but

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:26.659 
want them concentrating on the scrum but

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.179 
want them concentrating on the scrum but

does<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:37.280> affect<00:01:37.550> what<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.820> can<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.090> if<00:01:38.300> he's

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
does it affect what you can do if he's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.180 
does it affect what you can do if he's

if<00:01:46.670> he's<00:01:47.030> under<00:01:47.300> pressure<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:48.260> last<00:01:48.470> thing<00:01:48.620> he

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
if he's under pressure the last thing he

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.440 
if he's under pressure the last thing he
wants<00:01:48.980> is<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.250> losing<00:01:49.850> your<00:01:49.880> shoulder<00:01:50.360> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
wants is you losing your shoulder and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.730 
wants is you losing your shoulder and
he's<00:01:50.570> under<00:01:50.780> even<00:01:50.930> more<00:01:51.020> pressure<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:51.620> he's

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
he's under even more pressure if he's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.430 
he's under even more pressure if he's
under<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.130> load<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.520> pressure<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.840> these

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
under a load of pressure and and these

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.320 
under a load of pressure and and these
hips<00:01:54.740> come<00:01:55.010> out<00:01:55.130> here<00:01:55.400> yeah<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.090> you're

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
hips come out here yeah so you're

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.450 
hips come out here yeah so you're
actually<00:01:56.540> being<00:01:56.840> wheeled<00:01:57.110> away<00:01:57.350> yet<00:01:57.980> on<00:01:58.130> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
to stay out of it because your next job

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.980 
to stay out of it because your next job
is<00:02:22.220> over<00:02:22.340> there<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.910> how<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.360> work<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.810> mean

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
is over there and how do you work I mean

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.630 
is over there and how do you work I mean
once<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> ball<00:02:24.440> does<00:02:24.709> come<00:02:24.860> out<00:02:24.950> how<00:02:25.130> do<00:02:25.490> you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
once the ball does come out how do you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920 
once the ball does come out how do you
work<00:02:25.819> with<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> other<00:02:26.540> members<00:02:26.870> of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
work with that with the other members of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.300 
work with that with the other members of
your<00:02:27.080> background<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.560> normally<00:02:27.980> you've<00:02:28.130> got

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
your background so normally you've got

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.860 
your background so normally you've got
the<00:02:28.430> eight<00:02:28.550> inside<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.120> there<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.690> get

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the eight inside of there so you can get

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.270 
the eight inside of there so you can get
off<00:02:29.990> quite<00:02:30.230> quickly<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.650> want<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.980> make<00:02:31.130> sure

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
off quite quickly you want to make sure

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.650 
off quite quickly you want to make sure
the<00:02:31.430> eight<00:02:31.550> doesn't<00:02:31.850> pick<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.390> nines

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the eight doesn't pick but the nines

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.120 
the eight doesn't pick but the nines
hopefully<00:02:33.170> they're<00:02:33.319> biting<00:02:33.709> at<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> heels

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
hopefully they're biting at the heels

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.770 
hopefully they're biting at the heels
you<00:02:34.280> know<00:02:34.430> Lee<00:02:34.790> diction<00:02:35.209> will<00:02:35.330> be<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.540> there

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you know Lee diction will be in there

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.720 
you know Lee diction will be in there
you<00:02:35.959> know<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:36.890> important<00:02:37.250> pressure<00:02:37.430> on<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you know just important pressure on the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.010 
you know just important pressure on the
pit<00:02:37.910> putting<00:02:38.239> pressure<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.600> trying<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> make

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
pit putting pressure on trying to make

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.390 
pit putting pressure on trying to make
sure<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.350> eight<00:02:39.440> can't<00:02:39.709> get<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.890> good<00:02:40.069> run<00:02:40.280> up

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
sure the eight can't get a good run up

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.370 
sure the eight can't get a good run up
and<00:02:40.580> then<00:02:41.060> your<00:02:41.239> next<00:02:41.450> job<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.780> looking<00:02:42.020> at<00:02:42.140> ten

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
and then your next job is looking at ten
