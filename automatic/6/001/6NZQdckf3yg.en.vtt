anything literally anything the morphine

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
anything literally anything the morphine
my<00:00:59.640> back<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.420> had<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> tool<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.199> can

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
my back then it had like a tool you can

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.830 
my back then it had like a tool you can
move<00:01:01.500> morph<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:02.039> them<00:01:02.280> no<00:01:02.399> no<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.300> you

first<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> morphing<00:01:09.900> mod<00:01:10.080> works<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
first of how the morphing mod works you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
first of how the morphing mod works you
don't<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.860> how<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> basically<00:01:11.850> what

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you're gonna want to craft the morphing

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.570 
you're gonna want to craft the morphing
