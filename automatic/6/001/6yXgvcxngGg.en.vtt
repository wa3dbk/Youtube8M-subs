00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
know what comes and goes but overall I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
know what comes and goes but overall I
feel<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.930> feel<00:00:55.320> pretty<00:00:55.800> good<00:00:56.070> there's<00:00:56.430> moments

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
feel I feel pretty good there's moments

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240 
feel I feel pretty good there's moments
of<00:00:56.940> weakness<00:00:57.410> but<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.739> said<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.980> don't

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
of weakness but like I said I don't

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.399 
of weakness but like I said I don't
drink<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.550> much<00:00:59.670> lemonade<00:01:00.239> anymore<00:01:02.390> insofar

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
drink that much lemonade anymore insofar

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.810 
drink that much lemonade anymore insofar
measurements<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:06.650> all<00:01:07.650> together<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.400> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
measurements I all together I think so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.780 
measurements I all together I think so
if<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.060> washed<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.840> 20<00:01:13.170> pounds<00:01:13.650> 20<00:01:14.340> pounds<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
if I washed the 20 pounds 20 pounds a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:25.990 
if I washed the 20 pounds 20 pounds a
little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.150> less<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.360> 20<00:01:15.930> pounds<00:01:19.580> 21<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.799> I

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
little bit less but 20 pounds 21 and I

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
little bit less but 20 pounds 21 and I
have<00:01:27.000> five<00:01:27.299> more<00:01:27.479> days<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.409> excited

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
have five more days and I'm excited

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.240 
have five more days and I'm excited
about<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:30.020> I've<00:01:31.020> been<00:01:31.350> reflecting<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
about that I've been reflecting on the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.649 
about that I've been reflecting on the
past<00:01:32.280> overall<00:01:33.090> whether<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.479> been<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
past overall whether it's been a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.600 
past overall whether it's been a
positive<00:01:34.470> experience<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> negative

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
positive experience or a negative

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.770 
positive experience or a negative
I<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.930> overall<00:01:38.170> has<00:01:38.320> been<00:01:38.470> positive<00:01:39.780> I've

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
I think overall has been positive I've

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.870 
I think overall has been positive I've
done<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.200> Master<00:01:41.560> Cleanse<00:01:41.590> before<00:01:42.280> for<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
done the Master Cleanse before for the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.790 
done the Master Cleanse before for the
longest<00:01:43.480> before<00:01:43.900> was<00:01:44.050> 21<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:44.680> I'll<00:01:44.770> just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
longest before was 21 so I'll just

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.000 
longest before was 21 so I'll just
surpassed<00:01:45.400> my<00:01:45.690> last<00:01:46.690> goal<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:49.620> think<00:01:50.620> what<00:01:50.830> it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
surpassed my last goal I think what it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.160 
surpassed my last goal I think what it
wasn't<00:01:51.280> as<00:01:51.370> good<00:01:51.610> as<00:01:51.760> my<00:01:51.970> last<00:01:52.300> fast<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.930> felt

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
wasn't as good as my last fast I felt

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.219 
wasn't as good as my last fast I felt
like<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.350> lot<00:01:53.650> more<00:01:53.830> detox<00:01:54.370> tea<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.060> good<00:01:56.050> I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
like a lot more detox tea and good I

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.380 
like a lot more detox tea and good I
think<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.950> know<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.640> do<00:02:00.850> things<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
think that you know you do things and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.270 
think that you know you do things and
you<00:02:01.479> expect<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.140> be<00:02:02.350> exactly<00:02:02.440> like<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
you expect it to be exactly like the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.580 
you expect it to be exactly like the
last<00:02:03.520> time<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.880> did<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.120> but<00:02:04.330> things<00:02:05.200> change

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
last time you did it but things change

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.150 
last time you did it but things change
you<00:02:05.950> know<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:06.430> but<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.990> been<00:02:08.350> eye-opening<00:02:08.619> in

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
you know so but it's been eye-opening in

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.100 
you know so but it's been eye-opening in
the<00:02:09.280> sense<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.759> strength<00:02:10.509> wise<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.080> know

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the sense of strength wise you know

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.480 
the sense of strength wise you know
because<00:02:11.470> there's<00:02:11.680> been<00:02:11.890> moments<00:02:12.070> where<00:02:12.400> I've

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
because there's been moments where I've

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.640 
because there's been moments where I've
been<00:02:12.640> like<00:02:12.790> ah<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.750> forget<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.410> stuck

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
been like ah just forget it and I stuck

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.670 
been like ah just forget it and I stuck
to<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.830> guns<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.550> that's<00:02:16.239> made<00:02:17.050> me<00:02:17.260> feel<00:02:17.470> good

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
to my guns so that's made me feel good

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.680 
to my guns so that's made me feel good
um<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.459> there's<00:02:22.000> also<00:02:22.209> other<00:02:22.420> ways

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
um I think that there's also other ways
