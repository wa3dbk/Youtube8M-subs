use the pages to help start the fire or
something<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.299> might<00:02:00.630> work<00:02:00.840> but

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
something like that that might work but

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.319 
something like that that might work but
I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> might<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.460> able<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:03.149> thing

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
that's cheaper to use newspapers on

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
because this is just trash horrible then

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.320 
because this is just trash horrible then
