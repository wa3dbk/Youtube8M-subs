actually the ionic technology from the
Flatiron<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:28.000> I<00:00:28.030> used<00:00:28.390> it<00:00:29.110> really<00:00:29.860> smooths

out the hair and the cuticle and it just

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.119 
out the hair and the cuticle and it just
helps<00:00:33.280> prevent<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.059> frizz<00:00:34.359> as<00:00:34.809> my<00:00:35.679> hair<00:00:35.890> goes

the<00:01:37.929> video<00:01:38.109> I'm<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:39.250> kind<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.579> going<00:01:39.640> over<00:01:40.179> it

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
the video I'm just kind of going over it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.830 
the video I'm just kind of going over it
really<00:01:40.450> slowly<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:42.700> necessarily<00:01:43.000> making

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
really slowly and not necessarily making

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.340 
really slowly and not necessarily making
it<00:01:44.140> very<00:01:44.530> very<00:01:44.829> straight<00:01:45.359> then<00:01:46.359> I'm<00:01:46.630> starting

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
it very very straight then I'm starting

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.669 
it very very straight then I'm starting
to<00:01:47.439> take<00:01:47.619> larger<00:01:48.070> sections<00:01:48.520> because<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.810> the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
to take larger sections because the the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.529 
to take larger sections because the the
plates<00:01:51.009> are<00:01:51.310> made<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.700> titanium<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.390> they're

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
plates are made of titanium and they're

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.389 
plates are made of titanium and they're
actually<00:01:52.869> very<00:01:52.899> very<00:01:53.259> smooth<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.100> my<00:01:54.219> hair

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
actually very very smooth and so my hair

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.029 
actually very very smooth and so my hair
just<00:01:54.579> kind<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:54.880> started<00:01:55.210> gliding<00:01:55.689> in<00:01:56.649> between

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
just kind of started gliding in between

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.029 
just kind of started gliding in between
the<00:01:57.130> plates<00:01:57.399> very<00:01:57.670> smoothly<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.799> just

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
the plates very smoothly and so I just

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.109 
the plates very smoothly and so I just
thought<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.490> know<00:02:00.579> what<00:02:00.729> I'm<00:02:00.819> just<00:02:00.969> going<00:02:01.090> to

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
thought you know what I'm just going to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.940 
thought you know what I'm just going to
take<00:02:01.270> larger<00:02:01.659> sections<00:02:02.079> because<00:02:02.289> this<00:02:02.619> isn't

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
take larger sections because this isn't

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.849 
take larger sections because this isn't
a<00:02:03.009> very<00:02:03.219> neat<00:02:03.609> look<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.420> all<00:02:05.350> I'm<00:02:05.499> doing

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
a very neat look and all I'm doing

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.590 
a very neat look and all I'm doing
really<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.369> just<00:02:06.640> taking<00:02:06.880> out<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.359> natural

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
really is just taking out the natural

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.210
