 awake and eager to cook 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.249

 because I'm a chef here we're going to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 do as much as possible to convert us 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:32.310
 in some experts in the kitchen and already without 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.610
 more today's recipe our first 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.610
 cheese sandwich program 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.580
 and we are already here my grandfather is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.880
 good what is left of him my grandfather 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.460
 is the one who has taught me the most things in 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.140
 cook so I have it as an amulet what 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.730
 I turn to see everything we are going to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 do and ready 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.610
 we started then we're going to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.380
 need for the cheese sandwich what 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 first the ingredients there we go 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 we will need 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 two slices of bread 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.380
 as well 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.579
 a slice or slice or slice depends 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.420
 as you want to tell him about cheese in this 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.799
 yellow case and this is a 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.399
 special ingredient that is an olive 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.250
 green stuffed as we begin with the bread 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 to spend what slice we can 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.370
 use the one above or the one below that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.520
 It is very important, I tell you 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.540
 then gives the same either by 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 example here I will use the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.900
 up which is the one I have most at hand 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.040
 then to spend we take it and we go 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.899
 to put here in the middle of the plate to 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.740
 which gives us a more professional finish 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.710
 now we're going with the cheese with a 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.150
 hand and with the other we take it by the 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.700
 corners then from here and from the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 edge of the bread that is closest to me 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330
 cheese since it's cooking and further 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.960
 of you I am what you are seeing 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.010
 then we make them match a little 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.220
 forward we trust and let go and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.740
 there is our slice on top of 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.340
 our slice on top of our slice 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.730
 of bread now the other slice of bread gives 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.400
 Like if so or if so whether 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.569
 it does not matter for proof I will close the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.829
 eyes 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.230
 as it is thus it arrived here and until 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.700
 then the same thing that we did with the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.849
 cheese we match the edges 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.689
 we lean a little we trust and let go 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.269
 and there it is if it is not perfect because what 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.849
 we move a little to match all 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.060
 the edges and then we have our 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.879
 dish almost ready we are missing our 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.659
 special ingredient and for that is the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:30.459
 olive this olive that we see here 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:35.230
 then how are we going to do we take a 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.239
 stick of these and here in the middle but 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.840
 of this part not where they have the holes 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.310
 of this part we are going to introduce it like this 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.310
 so so so 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.069
 at the end and until then what are we going to 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:56.799
 do well now in the center of the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:59.859
 half of the sandwich we're going to click with 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.780
 this until we get here it's over 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.819
 where the olive but we continue and the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.219
 stick let us continue we go down 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.290
 we go down when we come to a place that 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.840
 we can not do any more is that we have reached 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.689
 dish is left there that the dish does not 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.019
 go through there is this little detail 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:20.739
 it gives a great touch the difference between 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.009
 a sandwich and the sandwich this 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.590
 we have then we are going to 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:31.120
