breathtaking very cool our the fact is
it's<00:00:18.279> quite<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:18.609> hard<00:00:18.820> work<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.240> get<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.600> those

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
it's quite a hard work to get to those

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's quite a hard work to get to those
walls<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.430> athletes<00:00:21.850> they<00:00:22.030> have<00:00:22.210> to

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
walls and the athletes they have to

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.510 
walls and the athletes they have to
carry<00:00:22.600> the<00:00:22.900> backpacks<00:00:23.380> which<00:00:24.070> are<00:00:24.310> heavy

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
carry the backpacks which are heavy

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.330 
carry the backpacks which are heavy
loaded<00:00:24.940> with<00:00:25.119> arnis<00:00:25.630> all<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.800> hardware<00:00:27.160> our

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
loaded with arnis all the hardware our

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.189 
loaded with arnis all the hardware our
ropes<00:00:27.730> so<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.449> whole<00:00:28.570> equipment<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.170> very

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
ropes so the whole equipment is very

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:37.170 
ropes so the whole equipment is very
very<00:00:29.770> happy<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.829> spring<00:00:36.100> 13<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.670> new<00:00:36.789> addition

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
very happy for spring 13 a new addition

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.150 
very happy for spring 13 a new addition
in<00:00:37.300> our<00:00:37.390> rotor<00:00:37.720> range<00:00:38.020> will<00:00:38.410> be<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.860> virtual

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
in our rotor range will be the virtual

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.240 
in our rotor range will be the virtual
plasma<00:00:39.579> which<00:00:39.790> is<00:00:39.820> our<00:00:40.210> first

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
plasma which is our first

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.770 
plasma which is our first
high-performance<00:00:42.250> technical<00:00:42.700> approach<00:00:43.030> the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
high-performance technical approach the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.210 
high-performance technical approach the
challenge<00:00:44.170> here<00:00:44.320> was<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.710> really<00:00:44.920> create<00:00:45.130> a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
challenge here was to really create a

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.010 
challenge here was to really create a
shoe<00:00:45.489> which<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:45.940> kind<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.390> balance<00:00:46.870> between

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
shoe which is kind of a balance between

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.290 
shoe which is kind of a balance between
mountaineering<00:00:48.010> shoe<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.460> an<00:00:48.579> approach<00:00:49.059> shoe

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
mountaineering shoe and an approach shoe

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.720 
mountaineering shoe and an approach shoe
so<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.440> want<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.710> have<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> stability<00:00:51.550> that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
so we want to have the stability that

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
so we want to have the stability that
you<00:00:51.850> have<00:00:52.000> in<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.210> mountaineering<00:00:52.690> shoe

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you have in a mountaineering shoe

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.740 
you have in a mountaineering shoe
therefore<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:54.190> are<00:00:54.219> using<00:00:54.730> an<00:00:55.120> our<00:00:55.329> cradle

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
therefore we are using an our cradle

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.350 
therefore we are using an our cradle
technology<00:00:55.870> which<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:57.360> technology

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
technology which is a technology

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.540 
technology which is a technology
platform<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:59.050> our<00:00:59.170> builder<00:00:59.559> series<00:00:59.920> which

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
platform for our builder series which

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.220 
platform for our builder series which
makes<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.910> shoe<00:01:01.059> super<00:01:01.420> super<00:01:01.719> stable<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
makes the shoe super super stable in the

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.540 
makes the shoe super super stable in the
whole<00:01:02.379> heel<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.829> gives<00:01:02.980> really<00:01:03.280> added

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
whole heel and gives really added

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.340 
whole heel and gives really added
stability<00:01:03.700> when<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.329> walk<00:01:04.600> with<00:01:04.809> heavy<00:01:05.049> loads

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
stability when you walk with heavy loads

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.539 
stability when you walk with heavy loads
in<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.680> technical<00:01:06.159> terrain<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.190> other<00:01:09.369> hand

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
in a technical terrain on the other hand

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.950 
in a technical terrain on the other hand
we<00:01:09.670> wanted<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.030> make<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.299> shoe<00:01:10.479> super<00:01:10.780> light

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
we wanted to make the shoe super light

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.350 
we wanted to make the shoe super light
so<00:01:11.229> I'm<00:01:11.409> really<00:01:11.890> builded<00:01:12.280> up<00:01:12.430> having<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
so I'm really builded up having the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.180 
so I'm really builded up having the
athlete<00:01:13.690> in<00:01:13.840> mind<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:14.350> having<00:01:14.950> really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
athlete in mind and having really

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.859 
athlete in mind and having really
protection<00:01:15.880> parts<00:01:16.180> where<00:01:16.330> you<00:01:16.360> need<00:01:16.600> in<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
protection parts where you need in the

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.560 
protection parts where you need in the
whole<00:01:17.020> forefoot<00:01:17.440> area<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:18.240> saving<00:01:19.240> rate<00:01:19.420> on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
whole forefoot area and saving rate on

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.149 
whole forefoot area and saving rate on
the<00:01:19.659> mid<00:01:19.810> foot<00:01:19.960> area<00:01:20.290> where<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:20.590> don't<00:01:20.770> touch

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
the mid foot area where you don't touch

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.200 
the mid foot area where you don't touch
the<00:01:21.400> rock<00:01:21.580> that<00:01:21.729> much<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:24.549> approach<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.060> wall

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the rock that much to approach the wall

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.700 
the rock that much to approach the wall
you<00:01:25.330> often<00:01:25.600> work<00:01:25.720> through<00:01:26.020> technical<00:01:26.439> terrain

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
you often work through technical terrain

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.340 
you often work through technical terrain
but<00:01:27.040> also<00:01:27.250> through<00:01:27.790> regular<00:01:28.750> hiking<00:01:29.080> trails

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
but also through regular hiking trails

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.830 
but also through regular hiking trails
so<00:01:29.680> we're<00:01:29.979> really<00:01:30.189> looking<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.549> develop<00:01:31.510> out

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
so we're really looking to develop out

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.050 
so we're really looking to develop out
so<00:01:32.080> together<00:01:32.260> with<00:01:32.560> Vibram<00:01:33.040> which<00:01:33.250> takes<00:01:33.880> all

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
so together with Vibram which takes all

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.820 
so together with Vibram which takes all
this<00:01:34.210> into<00:01:34.450> consideration<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:35.710> have

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
this into consideration so you have

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.740 
this into consideration so you have
certain<00:01:36.130> parts<00:01:36.460> which<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.939> more<00:01:37.450> friction

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
certain parts which have a more friction

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.600 
certain parts which have a more friction
area<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.409> it<00:01:38.560> but<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.100> still<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.460> like

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
area to it but you still have like

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.760 
area to it but you still have like
really<00:01:40.270> deep<00:01:40.450> blocks<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.930> also<00:01:41.049> braking<00:01:41.590> area

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
really deep blocks and also braking area

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.950 
really deep blocks and also braking area
here<00:01:42.159> as<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.400> know<00:01:42.490> from<00:01:42.700> hiking<00:01:42.909> shoes<00:01:43.299> so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
here as you know from hiking shoes so

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.080 
here as you know from hiking shoes so
it's<00:01:44.110> really<00:01:44.290> this<00:01:44.439> kind<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.890> perfect<00:01:45.880> hybrid

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
it's really this kind of perfect hybrid

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's really this kind of perfect hybrid
shoe<00:01:46.450> which<00:01:46.659> brings<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.200> from<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.650> wall<00:01:47.890> over

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
shoe which brings you from the wall over

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.420 
shoe which brings you from the wall over
heavy<00:01:49.600> terrain<00:01:49.960> you're<00:01:50.380> able<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.680> go<00:01:51.280> even

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
heavy terrain you're able to go even

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.160 
heavy terrain you're able to go even
through<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> via<00:01:51.880> ferrata<00:01:51.970> on<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.689> way<00:01:52.780> up<00:01:52.960> all

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
through a via ferrata on the way up all

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.319 
through a via ferrata on the way up all
the<00:01:53.229> way<00:01:53.290> down<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.770> brings<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.880> really<00:01:55.119> to

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
the way down and brings you really to

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.230
