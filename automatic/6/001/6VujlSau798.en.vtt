00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.529
 what infrastructure here 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 I also liked the crowd very much. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190
 from Sao Paulo 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 so it was because they have goals 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.660
 because also through intercession a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.660
 great study the world doctor 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.000
 the crowd always wants to see the player 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.580
 sacrificed himself by killing himself in the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.210
 I tried to do my job for real and 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.079
 make a fight late on the field and 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.079
 make goals, huh? 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.070
 There's a lot of Corinthian fans here. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.860
 Most finding that the street smucking 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.310
 Corinthian and lighthouse or not to win you 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.240
 You gotta do it, that 's what it 's for. 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 very good 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.130

 My parents are also the best for me. 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.720
 thing that could make a human being 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.640
 will perform the other person and have many 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.840
 things do not have happiness many people 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.420

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.619
 I can not handle it for everyone 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 more for a people who really 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.920
 They need help 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.690
 I think now in Japan it 's not being 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.640
 It's very beautiful to play with the fans. 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.000
