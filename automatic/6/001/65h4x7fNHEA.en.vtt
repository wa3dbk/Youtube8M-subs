Wimbledon without being a nurse yeah
that's<00:04:50.710> that's<00:04:50.950> what<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.250> thought<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.820> that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
that's that's what I thought and that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.630 
that's that's what I thought and that
hurts<00:04:52.419> him<00:04:52.660> because<00:04:52.990> he's<00:04:53.470> got<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> counts<00:04:54.520> on

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
hurts him because he's got a counts on

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.940 
hurts him because he's got a counts on
his<00:04:54.669> serve<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.240> lot<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.320> when<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.620> know<00:04:56.890> you

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
his serve a lot and so when you know you

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.710 
his serve a lot and so when you know you
don't<00:04:57.220> have<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.580> serve<00:04:57.940> as<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> weapon<00:04:58.419> it

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
don't have that serve as a weapon it

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.200 
don't have that serve as a weapon it
takes<00:04:58.930> away<00:04:59.200> of<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.500> defensive<00:05:00.430> returning<00:05:01.090> it

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
takes away of a defensive returning it

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.600 
takes away of a defensive returning it
puts<00:05:01.660> more<00:05:01.900> pressure<00:05:01.960> on<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:02.650> return<00:05:03.190> surf

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
puts more pressure on you to return surf

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.120 
puts more pressure on you to return surf
because<00:05:04.510> if<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.870> lose<00:05:05.350> you're<00:05:05.620> served<00:05:05.890> and
