00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
because this part i was just whilst i

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.550 
because this part i was just whilst i
was<00:01:16.030> assembling<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.720> i<00:01:16.869> noticed<00:01:17.290> that<00:01:17.470> the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
was assembling it i noticed that the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.080 
was assembling it i noticed that the
eller<00:01:17.800> on<00:01:18.040> has<00:01:18.280> actually<00:01:19.180> come<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:21.100> undone

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
eller on has actually come like undone

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.010 
eller on has actually come like undone
from<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:23.310> wing<00:01:24.310> here<00:01:24.789> it's<00:01:25.119> just<00:01:25.539> come

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
from the wing here it's just come

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.200 
from the wing here it's just come
completely<00:01:26.530> off<00:01:26.619> almost<00:01:27.069> so<00:01:27.819> that's<00:01:28.000> not

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
completely off almost so that's not

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.240 
completely off almost so that's not
going<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.450> be<00:01:28.509> suitable<00:01:28.840> for<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.530> stable<00:01:29.860> flight

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
going to be suitable for a stable flight

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.730 
going to be suitable for a stable flight
so<00:01:31.119> what<00:01:31.539> i'm<00:01:31.630> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> do<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.200> they<00:01:32.590> will

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
so what i'm going to do is they will

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.880 
so what i'm going to do is they will
send<00:01:33.039> me<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> replacement<00:01:33.910> part<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.390> then<00:01:35.259> i

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
send me the replacement part and then i

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.590 
send me the replacement part and then i
guess<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.520> whole<00:01:36.670> wing<00:01:36.910> will<00:01:37.090> arrive<00:01:37.360> then

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
guess the whole wing will arrive then

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080 
guess the whole wing will arrive then
I'll<00:01:37.720> add<00:01:37.929> this<00:01:38.170> decal<00:01:38.679> to<00:01:38.709> here<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.459> then<00:01:39.520> it

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
I'll add this decal to here and then it

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.300 
I'll add this decal to here and then it
