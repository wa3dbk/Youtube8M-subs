 I'm an actor and I'm going to speak quickly today. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.150
 about a film that will reach the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.080

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.689
 The plot has 62 flashbacks, the first being 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.210

 frank madagascar shows the little babies 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.309
 little babies are in the north with the edict 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.500
 walking until he found of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 recruits to a recruit is from there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 Then begins the adventure that begins 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.399
 when they flee the circus of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.989

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.270
 People can not take it anymore, we run away. 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 and there begins the story where he finds 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 a villain who makes me part of the past 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 since it is called davi that it is the people who 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 wants revenge on them but playing more 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 a megalomaniac behind it is the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 movie basically the penguins with team 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.600
 called not all of us trying to end it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.600
 the people's plans 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.430
 00 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.979
 for those who do not know agatha style well 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.510
 if there is anyone knows this was 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.630
 the highlight of the first animation 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.610
 of madagascar there in 2005 thereafter 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 Also in the Proceedings of the two years three 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.240
 tanks ended up winning a series 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.310
 own television the penguins of 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.830
 madagascar in 2008 a series well 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.990
 fun even and I remember for a long time 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.450
 that there was this thing of wanting to make a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.509
 his several other penguins movie with 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.789
 kowalski by captain per recruit only with 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.229
 them and ended up rolling in the beginning of 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.080
 2015 has finally hit theaters 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.000
 Brazilians have to pay dearly if a 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.300
 Simple tech animation has a script 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.880
 simple that focused on this thing of the 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.530
 staff who has an inmate 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.360
 a member that ends up not being so well 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.710
 considerable as the others 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.330
 there is a villain they have to give a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.840
 way to win opinion basically is 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.700
 the heart of the script or what moves the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.510
 onwards the north wind is a 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:24.850
 elite task force 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:26.230
 a secret elite task force that 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.180
 line with this simple script that makes the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.190
 movie stay interesting love that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 typical humor of the penguins that they 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.769
 The movies were already working and in the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 works here too because it is a great 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.730
 highlight of the movie are the penguins 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.650
 they are fun they are comical 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.540
 situations that they get into 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.489
 ends up being funny fun and yields 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.750
 good parts to you have a good laugh 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.269
 during the movie 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.640
 the action is there that is also present 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.260
 half comical he or very funny but 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.610
 it's not something extraordinary 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.440
 in the end penguins of 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.959
 madagascar is a children's animation b 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.609
 child care so parents can please 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.440
 for taking the kids with you a little 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.690
 but will watch it end up liking the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250
 movie is not a shot of a movie like this 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.829
 What are you going to do best? 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.470
 animation animation year though 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.079
 ends up being neither forgettable the passing of the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.609
 time will be both in memory but it is 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.859
 A fun movie that is worth seeing 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.840
 than the original distribution during the 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.060
 credits that one of the bank's characters 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.030
 by the bandit with bete 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.550
 of the film scheduled here and as always 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.040
 3d does not make a difference so if you 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:40.489

 that the villain calls us this happens 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.830

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.069

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.780
