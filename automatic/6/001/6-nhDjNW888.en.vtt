00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.370
 ah 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.240
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 tutorial that is how to create and remove 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.470
 hard drive partitions in windows 7 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.480
 and 8 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.340
 this is going to be done without programs 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 since we are going to occupy the same 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
 system tools this is very 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.090
 simple can be a little long but 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 simple now what we are going to do is 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.960
 go to our start menu and we're going to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.960
 look for partitions 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.690
 and as you can see one seemed 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.510
 be here that says control panel will 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.150
 we are going to click and we are going to open it and 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.190
 embarks that you are loading information 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.810
 once it is loaded it will appear 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.580
 all this here will appear 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.460
 our hard drive partitions in my 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.060
 case I already have one that is from the boom you 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.649
 I have my micro sd and the local disk ce and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.159
 is here reserved for the system 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.200
 do not modify it because you can 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.570
 the operating system is damaged and it does not 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 will repair them to what format 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.740
 because this is where the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.539
 most important files delete this is 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.120
 as they tell you by appointment at 32 they 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.030
 you will molar the pc 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.590
 now let's create the partition for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.410
 start let's select the volume 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.960
 that we want to reduce or the hard drive 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.930
 to put it simply 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.570
 I want to reduce the cce that we are going to 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.790
 do we are going to click right and 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.400
 reduce volume 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.190
 we take off to reduce it is 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.230
 consulting the space for the reduction 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.030
 because if we reduce too much, maybe 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.009
 our computer gets slow 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.730
 now what the space query I them 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.420
 I have to say that from a tutorial 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.490
 of the powerpoint that is how to create a 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.200
 labyrinth 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.640
 they asked me for a long time and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.950
 for reasons of time I could not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.660
 do it then I'm very wrong to 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.850
 say it then I have to see it back 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.920
 to start and in case these days was 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.890
 very slow my internet then if I 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.370
 I upload in HD quality they will try a lot 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.410
 that lasts 20 minutes the good tutorial since 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.890
 I finish consulting the space that 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.630
 we can reduce the space we are going to 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.290
 reduce in mega 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.120
 I'm going to put him 120 and once I 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.980
 we put what we want we are going to give 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 reduce 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.510
 we waited for you a little bit and once 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.129
 reduce us will appear here for a 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.150
 space if I remember correctly that comes to 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.210
 121 megs in my case with a line here 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.390
 top black 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.830
 in what ends up appearing me that I 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.020
 I 'm going to pass the video because sometimes 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.750
 so sometimes it does not depend 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.360
 I already finished consulting this rather 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.870
 to create the partition already once 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.850
 I'm going to give you a right click 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.410
 where it says not assigned the new volume 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.250
 simple 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.020
 and we are going to give you next following you 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.940
 let's assign a letter and I 'll 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.700
 put to you the selection to which 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.620
 want next and now here is where 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.349
 there is usually doubt 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.739
 file system which I put of 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.629
 default way is ntfs the 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.909
 disadvantage of formatting it with this 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.379
 file system is that it is not going to 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.140
 take advantage of all the space is going to 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.360
 mark as if they had this files 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.180
 saved those that I recommend is 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.480
 fax 32 and fac because these take more advantage 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.120
 the space of preference to fat that is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.310
 the one who takes the most 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.440
 and now we're going to put a label on 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.000
 volume in which we desire I 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.000
 I'll give you an example 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.400
 two 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.620
 and once we put the name of 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.260
 volume we are going to give you next and 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.269
 finish we wait and like you 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.709
 you can see already once it's over we 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.870
 this automatic playback appears 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.940
 example 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.190
 I'm going to open the folder to see 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.920
 the files as you can see me 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.020
 brand that is empty 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.760
 if this is not shown simply 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.040
 We open our start menu and we 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.990
 we go team as you can see 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.750
 here this partition appears that I finish 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.070
 to create and more my other partitions that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.060
 this is the main one this is the 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.060
 ubuntu and all this 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.870
 if what you wanted was to create the partition 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.210
 and here you can finish seeing the 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.050
 tutorial now what we're going to learn 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.669
 is to remove the partitions this is 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.650
 very simple, we're going to 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.419
 record management 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.389
 we are going to click right to the 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.040
 partition that we want to eliminate and you 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.310
 we will give remove volume 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.130
 we will give yes 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.500
 and now we have already established that this is space 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.740
 free we will give you right click and 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.920
 remove partition 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.530
 we are going to give him yes 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.510
 and once we have this we are going to see 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.760
 what partition in my case I want 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.620
 to assign 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.139
 space me in my case I want it 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.909
 return to the local disk c 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.400
 for this we are going to give right click to 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.439
 the partition we want 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.219
 return it to him and we are going to him to extend 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.930
 volume we are going to give you next 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.449
 next and end as you 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.509
 can see and this one got here until 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.279
 where we wanted and we can check 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.020
 that all this is already there is only this 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.759
 partition as you can see in 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.800
 team nothing else I appear those of the 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.840
 together and the windows 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.819
 well this would be everything very many 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.590

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.400
 comment or suggestion leave me in 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.590

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.440
 the redundancy 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.150
 if you need remote assistance please 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.660
 before asking me to install 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.430
 teamviewer to come doing this for 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.740
 that I can attend so 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.870
 simple and be ready if you do not know 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.330
 install in this area you are going to click
