very<00:00:50.160> fortunate<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.180> didn't<00:00:51.449> come<00:00:51.629> for

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
close combat a fireplug I'm gonna assume

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.270

he<00:00:53.670> predicted<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> u-turn<00:00:54.930> there

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
he predicted me to go for a u-turn there
that<00:00:56.280> works<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.640> very<00:00:56.699> well<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.180> him<00:00:57.449> except

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that works out very well for him except

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.330 
that works out very well for him except
for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> fact<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> he<00:00:58.949> tried<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.309> for

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
for the fact that he tried to go for

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
for the fact that he tried to go for
Bowl<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> judges<00:01:00.180> front<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.449> high<00:01:00.600> school

Bowl to a judges front of high school

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.240 
Bowl to a judges front of high school
which<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> ultimately<00:01:01.500> thought<00:01:02.100> he

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
which is what I ultimately thought he

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
which is what I ultimately thought he
was<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.290> he's<00:01:04.559> gonna

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
was going to do so now he's gonna

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
was going to do so now he's gonna
actually<00:01:05.010> go<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:05.430> extras<00:01:06.000> didn't<00:01:06.420> not

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
actually go into extras didn't not

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
actually go into extras didn't not
understand<00:01:07.560> why<00:01:08.010> he<00:01:08.400> went<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> Haxorus<00:01:09.150> panel

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
understand why he went to Haxorus panel

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.520 
understand why he went to Haxorus panel
made<00:01:10.020> no<00:01:10.200> sense<00:01:11.450> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> Dacron<00:01:13.020> now<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
made no sense going to Dacron now that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
made no sense going to Dacron now that
doesn't<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.580> makes<00:01:15.119> sense<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
doesn't make it makes sense but just I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560 
doesn't make it makes sense but just I
don't<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:16.650> understand<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
don't really understand it that much I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
don't really understand it that much I
guess<00:01:19.140> their<00:01:19.290> guess<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> why<00:01:19.740> he<00:01:19.950> wanted<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
guess their guess as to why he wanted to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
Gliscor which I mean you could have done

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.520 
Gliscor which I mean you could have done
this<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.720> first<00:01:45.990> place<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this in the first place in the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.899 
this in the first place in the
neoconservatives<00:01:47.189> agram<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.700> later<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
neoconservatives agram for later and

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.740 
neoconservatives agram for later and
using<00:01:49.750> sy<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.229> know<00:01:50.500> just<00:01:50.740> do<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.039> but<00:01:51.280> well

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
using sy you know just do that but well

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.880 
using sy you know just do that but well
so<00:01:52.750> it's<00:01:53.259> kind<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.469> like<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.740> know

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
so it's kind of like a you know

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.149 
so it's kind of like a you know
gliscor<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:55.090> know<00:01:55.210> stall<00:01:56.110> war<00:01:56.409> here<00:01:56.740> except

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
gliscor you know stall war here except

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.819 
gliscor you know stall war here except
that<00:01:57.340> we're<00:01:57.520> both<00:01:57.640> gonna<00:01:57.880> switch<00:01:58.210> out<00:01:58.530> he<00:01:59.530> is

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
that we're both gonna switch out he is

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.529 
that we're both gonna switch out he is
going<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.159> have<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.369> little<00:02:00.700> bit<00:02:00.789> of<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:01.000> better

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
going to have a little bit of a better

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.179 
going to have a little bit of a better
advantage<00:02:01.990> spin<00:02:02.320> on<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.619> because<00:02:02.860> he's<00:02:03.039> just

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
advantage spin on it because he's just

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.889 
advantage spin on it because he's just
gonna<00:02:03.280> be<00:02:03.429> able<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.610> hold<00:02:03.850> switch<00:02:04.149> right<00:02:04.600> out

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
gonna be able to hold switch right out

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.660 
gonna be able to hold switch right out
and<00:02:05.320> it's<00:02:05.710> actually<00:02:05.950> gonna<00:02:06.070> do<00:02:06.220> more<00:02:06.610> than

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and it's actually gonna do more than

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.669 
and it's actually gonna do more than
half<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.689> me<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.110> that's<00:02:08.229> gonna<00:02:08.470> be<00:02:08.530> really

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
half to me so that's gonna be really

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.320 
half to me so that's gonna be really
unfortunate<00:02:09.459> he's<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.789> gonna<00:02:09.940> end<00:02:10.090> up<00:02:10.209> going

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
unfortunate he's just gonna end up going

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.600 
unfortunate he's just gonna end up going

into its tentacle as I tried to go for

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.000 
into its tentacle as I tried to go for
the<00:02:12.790> Focus<00:02:13.120> Blast<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.690> obviously<00:02:14.500> that's<00:02:14.709> not

and<00:03:04.780> he<00:03:04.840> really<00:03:05.079> can't<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:05.380> anything<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.859> me<00:03:06.010> I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
and he really can't do anything to me I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.190 
and he really can't do anything to me I
could<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.850> keep<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.090> setting<00:03:07.389> up<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.840> I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
could just keep on setting up so I

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.620 
could just keep on setting up so I
decide<00:03:08.920> now<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.579> in<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> gliscor<00:03:10.510> he

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
decide now to just go in a gliscor he

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.120 
decide now to just go in a gliscor he
makes<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> very<00:03:11.049> nice<00:03:11.230> prediction<00:03:11.440> going<00:03:12.010> in

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
makes the very nice prediction going in

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.250 
makes the very nice prediction going in
to<00:03:12.220> tender<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.910> said<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.480> not<00:03:13.810> enough<00:03:14.109> to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
to tender like I said and not enough to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.830 
to tender like I said and not enough to
basically<00:03:14.680> force<00:03:15.130> myself<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.579> go<00:03:15.760> into<00:03:16.359> my

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
basically force myself to go into my

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.740 
basically force myself to go into my
reunit<00:03:17.530> clicks<00:03:17.739> now<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.819> is<00:03:18.970> what<00:03:19.150> happens<00:03:19.569> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
reunit clicks now this is what happens I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.940 
reunit clicks now this is what happens I
was<00:03:19.870> very<00:03:20.109> shocked<00:03:20.440> with<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.709> entire

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
was very shocked with this entire

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680 
was very shocked with this entire
outcome<00:03:21.250> um<00:03:21.670> he<00:03:21.940> actually<00:03:22.030> ends<00:03:22.329> up<00:03:22.389> going<00:03:22.480> for

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
outcome um he actually ends up going for

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.629 
outcome um he actually ends up going for
sludge<00:03:22.930> bomb<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:24.160> that's<00:03:24.340> gonna<00:03:24.459> have

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
sludge bomb because that's gonna have

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.300 
sludge bomb because that's gonna have
higher<00:03:24.850> base<00:03:25.060> damage<00:03:25.480> obviously<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.859> judging

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
higher base damage obviously and judging

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.590 
higher base damage obviously and judging
on<00:03:27.430> how<00:03:27.459> much<00:03:27.670> ice<00:03:27.880> beam<00:03:28.090> did<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.420> actually

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
on how much ice beam did I actually

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.030 
on how much ice beam did I actually
thought<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.380> know<00:03:29.470> sludge<00:03:29.739> Rollins

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
thought that you know sludge Rollins

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.160 
thought that you know sludge Rollins
gonna<00:03:30.130> kill<00:03:30.400> by<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.579> live<00:03:30.850> with<00:03:31.000> six<00:03:31.209> HP<00:03:31.630> gonna

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.900

whatever<00:06:22.940> reason<00:06:23.740> which<00:06:24.740> is<00:06:24.770> why<00:06:25.039> he<00:06:25.250> did<00:06:25.460> that

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
whatever reason which is why he did that

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.550 
whatever reason which is why he did that
honestly<00:06:26.120> he<00:06:26.419> could<00:06:26.629> have<00:06:26.720> saved<00:06:26.930> Haxorus<00:06:27.319> for

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
honestly he could have saved Haxorus for

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.469 
honestly he could have saved Haxorus for
later<00:06:27.710> he<00:06:28.610> could<00:06:28.729> have<00:06:28.819> just<00:06:28.970> you<00:06:29.060> know<00:06:29.180> let

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
later he could have just you know let

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.110 
later he could have just you know let
Tentacruel<00:06:29.990> die<00:06:30.370> and<00:06:31.370> then<00:06:31.490> with<00:06:31.669> that<00:06:31.699> he

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
Tentacruel die and then with that he

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.520 
Tentacruel die and then with that he
could've<00:06:32.360> just<00:06:32.389> brought<00:06:32.629> in<00:06:32.780> Haxorus<00:06:33.139> go<00:06:33.379> for

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
could've just brought in Haxorus go for

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.080 
could've just brought in Haxorus go for
a<00:06:33.590> Dragon<00:06:33.889> Claw<00:06:34.039> something<00:06:34.460> maybe<00:06:34.639> knock<00:06:34.909> out

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090

goodra<00:06:35.509> well<00:06:36.409> would<00:06:36.979> not<00:06:37.280> would<00:06:37.580> have<00:06:37.669> knocked

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
goodra well would not would have knocked

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.120 
goodra well would not would have knocked
out<00:06:38.000> goodra<00:06:38.449> and<00:06:38.599> then<00:06:39.110> he<00:06:39.349> you<00:06:39.500> know<00:06:39.710> he<00:06:39.979> would

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130

have<00:06:40.159> had<00:06:40.400> to<00:06:40.610> deal<00:06:41.210> with<00:06:41.389> a<00:06:41.650> faster<00:06:42.650> noivern

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
have had to deal with a faster noivern

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.020 
have had to deal with a faster noivern
than<00:06:43.340> him<00:06:43.580> or<00:06:43.759> higher<00:06:44.690> base<00:06:44.960> being<00:06:45.199> over<00:06:46.030> and

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
than him or higher base being over and

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.760 
than him or higher base being over and
then<00:06:47.690> he<00:06:47.900> would<00:06:47.990> also<00:06:48.110> have<00:06:48.319> to<00:06:48.440> deal<00:06:48.560> with<00:06:48.620> a

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
then he would also have to deal with a

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.710 
then he would also have to deal with a
defensive<00:06:49.250> gliscor<00:06:49.729> so<00:06:49.909> nonetheless<00:06:50.150> I<00:06:50.599> was

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
defensive gliscor so nonetheless I was

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.089 
defensive gliscor so nonetheless I was
gonna<00:06:50.840> wind<00:06:51.139> I<00:06:51.229> there's<00:06:51.409> really<00:06:51.680> no<00:06:51.889> problem

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
gonna wind I there's really no problem

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.499 
gonna wind I there's really no problem
with<00:06:52.340> that<00:06:52.430> at<00:06:52.550> all<00:06:52.639> but<00:06:52.699> I'm<00:06:53.000> just<00:06:53.030> saying<00:06:53.330> he

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
with that at all but I'm just saying he

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.210 
with that at all but I'm just saying he
could<00:06:53.539> have<00:06:53.750> made<00:06:53.870> that<00:06:53.990> a<00:06:54.050> little<00:06:54.349> bit<00:06:54.470> of<00:06:54.620> an

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
could have made that a little bit of an

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.559 
could have made that a little bit of an
easier<00:06:55.520> process<00:06:55.789> by<00:06:56.240> just<00:06:56.449> going<00:06:56.750> into<00:06:58.569> all

00:06:59.559 --> 00:06:59.569 
easier process by just going into all

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:00.969 
easier process by just going into all
just<00:06:59.780> letting<00:06:59.930> tentacle<00:07:00.380> dying<00:07:00.590> going<00:07:00.860> in

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
just letting tentacle dying going in
