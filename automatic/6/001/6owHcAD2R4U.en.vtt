00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
say they were going to double a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.530 
say they were going to double a

population of state of California by
2050<00:01:36.230> I<00:01:36.380> don't<00:01:37.070> know<00:01:37.130> what<00:01:37.310> they're<00:01:37.340> going<00:01:37.580> to

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
2050 I don't know what they're going to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.910 
2050 I don't know what they're going to
drink<00:01:37.940> but<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:38.540> not<00:01:38.690> going<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.900> be<00:01:39.020> water<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
drink but it's not going to be water the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.830 
drink but it's not going to be water the
water<00:01:40.190> will<00:01:40.340> be<00:01:40.520> showing<00:01:40.760> up<00:01:40.940> more<00:01:41.210> in<00:01:41.420> winter

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
than in summer and along with that it's

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.100 
than in summer and along with that it's
a<00:01:45.710> little<00:01:46.010> bit<00:01:46.130> less<00:01:46.460> certain<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.930> also

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
a little bit less certain but we also

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.680 
a little bit less certain but we also
expect<00:01:48.740> with<00:01:49.070> warmer<00:01:49.790> temperatures<00:01:50.150> there'll

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
expect with warmer temperatures there'll

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.160 
expect with warmer temperatures there'll
be<00:01:50.720> more<00:01:51.020> tendency<00:01:51.650> for<00:01:52.130> evaporation<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.210> so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
be more tendency for evaporation and so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.960 
be more tendency for evaporation and so
they'll<00:01:54.320> just<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.740> generally<00:01:55.280> less<00:01:55.520> water

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
they'll just be generally less water

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.090 
they'll just be generally less water

again you can you can put this out in a

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.530 
again you can you can put this out in a
stream<00:06:09.890> or<00:06:10.160> even<00:06:10.460> hang<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.910> in<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.150> tree<00:06:11.510> and

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
stream or even hang it in a tree and

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.740 
stream or even hang it in a tree and
measure<00:06:12.470> measurements<00:06:13.130> every<00:06:13.280> half<00:06:13.640> hour<00:06:13.880> for

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
measure measurements every half hour for

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.170 
measure measurements every half hour for
up<00:06:15.230> to<00:06:15.470> three<00:06:15.740> years<00:06:16.130> before<00:06:16.430> you<00:06:16.820> have<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.150> go

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
up to three years before you have to go

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.970 
up to three years before you have to go
and<00:06:17.510> get<00:06:17.750> it<00:06:17.960> yeah<00:06:18.530> those<00:06:18.710> kind<00:06:18.919> of

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
and get it yeah those kind of

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.210 
and get it yeah those kind of
technological<00:06:19.720> advances<00:06:20.800> really<00:06:21.800> are<00:06:21.980> what

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
technological advances really are what

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.890 
technological advances really are what
are<00:06:22.340> going<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.550> make<00:06:22.730> it<00:06:22.880> possible<00:06:23.150> for<00:06:23.540> us<00:06:23.870> to

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
are going to make it possible for us to

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.350 
are going to make it possible for us to
keep<00:06:24.380> up<00:06:24.620> with<00:06:24.650> and<00:06:25.130> keep<00:06:25.310> track<00:06:25.640> of<00:06:25.669> climate

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
keep up with and keep track of climate

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.110 
keep up with and keep track of climate
change<00:06:26.390> and<00:06:27.080> it's<00:06:27.260> impacts<00:06:27.710> as<00:06:27.980> they<00:06:28.730> occur

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
change and it's impacts as they occur

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.480 
change and it's impacts as they occur
without<00:06:29.750> having<00:06:30.320> to<00:06:30.530> begin<00:06:30.860> all<00:06:31.070> over<00:06:31.100> again
