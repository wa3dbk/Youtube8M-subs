00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.770
 tg all the guys are the lines are 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.390
 here in extraordinary version that is very much 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.430
 then briefly assault for 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.860
 inform you of the potential leak of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.900
 information appeared on kotaku where 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.790
 take all this as information 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.660
 not confirmed but still keep it 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.579
 bill 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.410
 I said where the would be revealed 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.030
 release date of the next mega 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.739
 expansion of swarms it should 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.219
 be called the tech and in king 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.309
 that is, it should be released on September 15th 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.510
 2015 at this point is almost never ever 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.130
 confirmed the name of tekken king also 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.010
 if not officially but in short they are 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.550
 days that various leagues bombard with 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.230
 this name 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.910
 now all this information is 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.710
 come out of various materials of 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.370
 marketing that have been distributed 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.630
 by industry insiders and if they were 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.030
 confirmed well for sure they will do the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.579
 someone's joy but primarily because 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 in the next expansion that takes place 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.659
 will be around $ 40 always according to i 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.490
 leak therefore will cost more than a normal one 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.409
 wolf house or written from the depths 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.929
 precisely because it will have more content in 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.090
 general at least one raid will be scheduled 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.189
 sure a raid focused on orix father 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.639
 dick rota who seeks revenge who will lead 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.950
 an army of villains the new types of 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:28.959
 Enemies are called called the taken 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.969
 clearly we will be included on maps 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.340
 Filipino had sinned but above all 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.439
 third subclasses will be introduced 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.639
 as I had already anticipated time 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.389
 back one of the more features 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.549
 requests 

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.990
 we will have a hunter and we should empty 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.840
 have an empty soccer player with the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.929
 gravity buoy in practice a kind of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.600
 vacuum bow a sorcerer condemns to 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.029
 arc with an electrical storm then 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.279
 electrical storm a kind of storm 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:56.859
 and the hicks me maybe the titan finally 

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:59.859
 with solar dani that will use flaming 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.479
 hammer ie a tower fire hammer 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.240
 always welcome but lightning though in 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.859
 this case uses them in the sorcerer now 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.170
 someone is also assuming that 15 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.680
 September coincides with the period in which 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.810
 the contents between playstation xbox will be 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.760
 uniformed then lunar hawk 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.560
 montecarlo assalti bar bla bla bla ci 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.850
 will therefore also be on xbox should 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.380
 end exclusivity 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.660
 temporary of some of the contents of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.180
 destiny only for playstation 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.800
 these however are only assumptions 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.140
 take care once again that these are 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.640
 news not confirmed so I'm not 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.740
 official and therefore not 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.050
 they still represent nothing definitive 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.660
 it is possible that they are just some of the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.610
 new content of the taking how to do 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.950
 to learn more well wait for e3 a 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.810
 a few days 3 will be held from 16 to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.400
 June 18, let's not wait for some 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.380
 update by bungee jobs 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.750
 in the next week there will be an update stop 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.640
 using is what we could hope for 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.050
 to see or maybe we could hope 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.660
 to find from September 15th 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.760
 possibly in contact and that you eat at 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.290
 a kind of todolist ie a list of 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.510
 things to do that have been highlighted 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 from the community of destiny players 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.650
 of the whole world and in this list there 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.660
 i am so kind between smog riff action ie 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.070
 change the appearance of a weapon maybe there is 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.930
 a weapon that you particularly like but 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.520
 which sucks to meet with the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.220
 transmigration you can get hired 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.980
 then the appearance of a cool weapon 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.970
 replacing the skin of the weapon you have 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.820
 Basic 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.860
 then the private games in the crucible the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.320
 balance of weapons also in pvp 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.720
 indeed especially in pvp and there are of 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.670
 things to balance the shaders there for 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.310
 weapons better interactions between factions 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.140
 and more functionality than counted clowns 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 precisely that this todolist are i 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.070
 wishes of bungee players there 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.810
 taking a look is not that 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.360
 we will find all these features and in the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.680
 next expansion well this is it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.270
 my friends, we just have to wait 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.980
 a few more days to know the 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.720
 truth I thank you as usual 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.770
