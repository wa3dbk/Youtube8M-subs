00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 and so we continue a series of lessons how to take 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 guitar chords and the next chord 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.480
 which we will now learn to practice 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.570
 chord e n minor cord minor 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 triad yes but in theory I'm basically 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 I give a little more showing how to take it 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 not to whom it is interesting to remind once again that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.809
 on the blog will be completely gazebos 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.120
 chords and fingering painted with 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 frets with fingers strings where what 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 the string needs to be clamped so now 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.850
 I give theories a little thing I will say 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.729
 what we will have is not the main tone of the chord 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.489
 salt small terc sy large terc but in 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.390
 In principle, this is not so important to us 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.049
 just learn to take the ACORD chord 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 I consider it one of the easiest 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.920
 chords as used here 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.799
 just two fingers and we pinch 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.310
 only two strings well let's 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.829
 analogies with previous lessons I will start with 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.350
 first string first is the thinnest and 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.020
 let's go in a row and where on to on what fret 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.149
 which country should be clamped first 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.420
 string in this chord it sounds 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.580
 open 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.520
 the second string in this chord is also 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.140
 sounds so open and the third string in 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 this chord sounds we just 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:52.250
 open here 4 5 string here in 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.950
 chord in e minor to us chords are clamped 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.899
 on the second fret, that is, those are watching 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.840
 third finger middle finger on 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.799
 second fret we pinch the fourth string 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.780
 and second finger on the same second fret 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:13.519
 we pinch 5 countries as it sounds 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.209
 now look at the fourth one and how 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.120
 sounds 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.420
 5 string clamped 2 together this 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.660
 the combination gives us like a port and here's how 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.660
 he sounds 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.810
 beautiful accord 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.410
 we try
