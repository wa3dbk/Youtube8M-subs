00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.580 
Bosh is out for this series I think that
if<00:02:18.010> Miami<00:02:18.610> losses

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
if Miami losses

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.449 
if Miami losses
in<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.830> round<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.550> teams<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.840> go<00:02:22.260> down<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
in this round and teams that go down to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.410 
in this round and teams that go down to
one<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:24.200> seven<00:02:25.200> game<00:02:25.379> series<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.069> NBA<00:02:26.420> only

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
one in seven game series in the NBA only

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.509 
one in seven game series in the NBA only
win<00:02:27.690> though<00:02:27.900> series<00:02:28.379> eighteen<00:02:28.980> percent<00:02:29.220> of

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
win though series eighteen percent of

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.490 
win though series eighteen percent of
the<00:02:29.610> time<00:02:29.819> historically<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.930> there's<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.170> very

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the time historically so there's a very

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.380 
the time historically so there's a very
good<00:02:31.650> chance<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.400> Miami<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.970> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.209> lose

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
good chance now Miami is going to lose

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.460 
good chance now Miami is going to lose
this<00:02:33.629> series<00:02:33.890> if<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.220> lose<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.730> series<00:02:36.470> yes

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
this series if they lose this series yes

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.770 
this series if they lose this series yes
there's<00:02:38.220> probably<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.700> very<00:02:38.940> good<00:02:39.209> chance<00:02:39.420> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
there's probably a very good chance that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
there's probably a very good chance that
that<00:02:40.019> Erik<00:02:40.349> Spoelstra<00:02:40.830> will<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:41.099> fired<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.060> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
that Erik Spoelstra will get fired but I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.780 
that Erik Spoelstra will get fired but I
think<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.690> also<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.290> great<00:02:43.890> chance<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
think there is also a great chance that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.570 
think there is also a great chance that
the<00:02:45.030> big<00:02:45.269> three<00:02:45.690> ERA<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:46.110> Miami<00:02:46.620> might<00:02:46.980> be<00:02:47.190> over

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
the big three ERA in Miami might be over

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.370 
the big three ERA in Miami might be over
and<00:02:47.790> if<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.900> had<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.379> speculate<00:02:50.450> about<00:02:51.450> which<00:02:52.349> of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
and if I had to speculate about which of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.610 
and if I had to speculate about which of
those<00:02:53.190> players<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:54.120> could<00:02:55.079> be<00:02:55.319> moved

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
those players that could be moved

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.870 
those players that could be moved
between<00:02:56.340> Bosh<00:02:57.030> LeBron<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.410> Dwyane<00:02:58.709> Wade<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
between Bosh LeBron and Dwyane Wade the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.759 
between Bosh LeBron and Dwyane Wade the
first<00:03:00.180> person<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.810> think<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.319> could<00:03:01.530> get

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
first person I think that could get

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.479 
first person I think that could get
moved<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.459> Dwayne<00:03:03.000> Wade<00:03:03.379> uh<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.980> reason<00:03:05.129> why<00:03:05.459> I

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
moved is Dwayne Wade uh the reason why I

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.259 
moved is Dwayne Wade uh the reason why I
say<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.150> he<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.650> LeBron<00:03:07.860> have<00:03:08.489> somewhat

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
say that is he and LeBron have somewhat

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.470 
say that is he and LeBron have somewhat
overlapping<00:03:09.989> skill<00:03:10.620> sets<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.310> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
overlapping skill sets to kind of do the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.750 
overlapping skill sets to kind of do the
same<00:03:12.750> things<00:03:13.110> their<00:03:13.680> ball<00:03:13.980> dominant<00:03:14.610> and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
same things their ball dominant and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.479 
same things their ball dominant and
their<00:03:15.569> drivers<00:03:16.170> more<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.950> than<00:03:17.190> outside

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
their drivers more so than outside

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.850 
their drivers more so than outside
shooters<00:03:18.209> spot-up<00:03:18.780> shooters<00:03:19.379> this<00:03:19.590> type<00:03:19.829> of

orchestrators the bottom line is in my

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.190 
orchestrators the bottom line is in my
opinion<00:03:26.310> LeBron<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.389> better<00:03:27.660> than<00:03:27.900> wade

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
opinion LeBron is better than wade

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.039 
opinion LeBron is better than wade
lebron<00:03:28.859> obviously<00:03:29.760> younger<00:03:30.329> than<00:03:30.540> wade<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
lebron obviously younger than wade and

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.530 
lebron obviously younger than wade and
I'm<00:03:31.799> not<00:03:32.190> sure<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:33.590> Dwyane<00:03:34.590> Wade<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.790> heat

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
I'm not sure that Dwyane Wade and heat

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.349 
I'm not sure that Dwyane Wade and heat
president<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.380> believe<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.920> president<00:03:38.459> pat

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
president I believe is the president pat

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.050 
president I believe is the president pat
riley<00:03:39.389> or<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.099> same<00:03:41.370> page<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.260> if<00:03:43.260> this

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
riley or on the same page and if this

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.680 
riley or on the same page and if this
experiment<00:03:45.060> fails<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:47.639> second<00:03:48.060> round<00:03:48.299> of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
experiment fails in the second round of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.690 
experiment fails in the second round of
the<00:03:49.280> 2012<00:03:50.280> NBA<00:03:50.819> playoffs<00:03:51.419> i<00:03:52.220> think<00:03:53.220> there<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.669> a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the 2012 NBA playoffs i think there is a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.059 
the 2012 NBA playoffs i think there is a
very<00:03:54.239> real<00:03:54.359> chance<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.410> big-three<00:03:55.680> era

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
very real chance that the big-three era

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.659 
very real chance that the big-three era
is<00:03:56.609> over<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:57.239> not<00:03:57.900> one<00:03:58.200> not<00:03:58.500> two<00:03:58.560> not<00:03:58.769> three<00:03:59.099> is

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
is over a not one not two not three is

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.960 
is over a not one not two not three is
going<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.940> end<00:04:00.120> up<00:04:00.269> as<00:04:00.510> zero<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.579> that<00:04:02.579> you

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
going to end up as zero and that you

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.589 
going to end up as zero and that you
could<00:04:03.389> see<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.900> real<00:04:04.910> makeover<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.030> this

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
could see a real makeover of this

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.180 
could see a real makeover of this
franchise<00:04:07.849> going<00:04:08.849> forward<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:09.510> ask<00:04:10.500> somebody

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
franchise going forward and ask somebody

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.520 
franchise going forward and ask somebody
that's<00:04:11.459> watched<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:12.120> lot<00:04:12.419> of<00:04:12.480> heat<00:04:12.840> games<00:04:13.200> in

that's watched a lot of heat games in

that's watched a lot of heat games in
the<00:04:13.950> last<00:04:13.980> two<00:04:14.430> years<00:04:14.730> follow<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.630> team<00:04:16.160> I'm

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
the last two years follow this team I'm

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.589 
the last two years follow this team I'm
not<00:04:17.400> sure<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.849> would<00:04:18.150> be<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.299> bad<00:04:18.539> thing

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
not sure that that would be a bad thing

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:24.379 
not sure that that would be a bad thing
this<00:04:19.560> team<00:04:19.950> has<00:04:20.340> not<00:04:21.620> come<00:04:22.620> together<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
this team has not come together in the

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.230 
this team has not come together in the
way<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.169> lot<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.889> observers<00:04:26.729> thought<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
way that a lot of observers thought it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.110 
way that a lot of observers thought it
would<00:04:27.539> come<00:04:27.840> together<00:04:28.520> yes<00:04:29.520> there's<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.909> lot<00:04:30.090> of

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
would come together yes there's a lot of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.770 
would come together yes there's a lot of
individual<00:04:30.900> talent<00:04:31.440> but<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.099> whole

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
individual talent but the whole

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.590 
individual talent but the whole
seems<00:04:33.440> lesser<00:04:34.310> than<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.730> sum<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.300> parts

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
seems lesser than the sum of the parts

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.200 
seems lesser than the sum of the parts
and<00:04:36.020> that's<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.860> not<00:04:36.980> good<00:04:37.340> enough<00:04:37.370> Pat

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
and that's just not good enough Pat

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.740 
and that's just not good enough Pat
Riley<00:04:38.720> wants<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.350> win<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:41.030> bronze<00:04:41.270> jeans

Riley wants to win the bronze jeans
needs<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.770> win<00:04:42.980> for<00:04:43.370> his<00:04:43.490> legacy<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:45.440> just

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
needs to win for his legacy and I just

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.640 
needs to win for his legacy and I just
think<00:04:46.130> that<00:04:46.430> if<00:04:46.730> they<00:04:47.000> go<00:04:47.300> out<00:04:47.540> in<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.110> second

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
think that if they go out in the second

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.920 
think that if they go out in the second
round<00:04:48.860> after<00:04:49.250> making<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.940> finals<00:04:50.450> last<00:04:50.660> year

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
round after making the finals last year

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.250 
round after making the finals last year
I<00:04:51.110> think<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:52.190> this<00:04:52.430> could<00:04:52.490> very<00:04:52.760> well<00:04:53.150> be<00:04:53.360> the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
I think that this could very well be the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.520 
I think that this could very well be the
end<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.520> big<00:04:55.760> three<00:04:56.000> experiment<00:04:56.870> down<00:04:57.260> in
