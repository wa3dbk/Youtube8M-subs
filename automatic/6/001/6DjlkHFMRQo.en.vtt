of<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> sudden<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:46.360> looked<00:02:46.569> up<00:02:46.720> at<00:02:46.840> each<00:02:46.959> other

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
of a sudden we looked up at each other

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.420 
of a sudden we looked up at each other
and<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.680> same<00:02:47.920> moment<00:02:48.069> said<00:02:48.430> DVD<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:51.190> was

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
so outside my comfort zone to think

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.210 
so outside my comfort zone to think
about<00:02:55.180> branching<00:02:55.569> out<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.950> to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
about branching out like that and to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.199
