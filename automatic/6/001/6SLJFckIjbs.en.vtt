much<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.130> at<00:02:14.310> first<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.850> wasn't<00:02:15.030> realizing

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
much and at first I wasn't realizing

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.699 
much and at first I wasn't realizing
what<00:02:15.660> he<00:02:15.720> was<00:02:15.840> doing<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:16.380> hell's<00:02:16.530> going

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
what he was doing like what hell's going

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.530 
what he was doing like what hell's going
on<00:02:16.769> here<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.280> wasn't<00:02:17.760> sure<00:02:17.910> what<00:02:18.060> he<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.269> doing

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
on here I wasn't sure what he was doing

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
on here I wasn't sure what he was doing
but<00:02:19.019> after<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.350> little<00:02:19.440> bit<00:02:19.709> after<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.040> realized

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
but after a little bit after I realized

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.620 
but after a little bit after I realized
what<00:02:20.640> he<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:20.819> doing<00:02:21.030> me<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.269> my<00:02:21.390> buddy

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
what he was doing me and my buddy

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.930 
what he was doing me and my buddy
decided<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.530> block<00:02:22.739> both<00:02:22.980> doorways<00:02:23.519> where<00:02:23.819> you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
decided to block both doorways where you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.250 
decided to block both doorways where you
see<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.180> enter<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.019> then<00:02:25.110> there's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
see I enter right now and then there's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
see I enter right now and then there's
another<00:02:25.440> door<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.709> laugh<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.220> me<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.150> pretty

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
another door I laugh to me so we pretty

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.670 
another door I laugh to me so we pretty
much<00:02:27.420> block<00:02:27.750> them<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.200> infections

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
much block them so that infections

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890 
much block them so that infections
cannot<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:30.120> least<00:02:30.239> any<00:02:30.569> more

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
cannot get in at least any more

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.809 
cannot get in at least any more
infections<00:02:31.319> can't<00:02:31.620> get<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.220> they

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
infections can't get in so they they

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.580 
infections can't get in so they they
they<00:02:33.120> won't<00:02:33.239> keep<00:02:33.480> dying<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.080> guy<00:02:34.290> won't

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
they won't keep dying and this guy won't

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.949 
they won't keep dying and this guy won't
keep<00:02:34.890> getting<00:02:35.190> kills<00:02:35.489> because<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.750> stupid

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
keep getting kills because it's stupid

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.059 
keep getting kills because it's stupid
you<00:02:37.140> shouldn't<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.500> boosting<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:37.950> an

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069

infection game-mode this is meant for

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.259 
infection game-mode this is meant for
fun<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.920> isn't<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.519> meant<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.760> boost<00:02:42.060> in

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
fun this isn't really meant to boost in

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.460 
fun this isn't really meant to boost in
I<00:02:42.390> mean<00:02:42.510> none<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> game<00:02:42.959> types<00:02:43.230> are<00:02:43.350> meant

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
I mean none of the game types are meant

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.569 
I mean none of the game types are meant
to<00:02:43.500> boost<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.100> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> pointless

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
to boost and it's kind of pointless

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.490 
to boost and it's kind of pointless
because<00:02:44.790> you're<00:02:45.510> putting<00:02:45.720> yourself<00:02:46.350> at<00:02:46.470> risk

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
because you're putting yourself at risk

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350 
because you're putting yourself at risk
get<00:02:46.890> banned<00:02:47.160> because<00:02:47.459> there<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.880> an<00:02:47.970> option

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
get banned because there is an option

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.140 
get banned because there is an option
when<00:02:48.840> you're<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.140> lobby<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.910> click<00:02:51.090> on

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
when you're in the lobby if you click on

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550 
when you're in the lobby if you click on
a<00:02:51.239> player's<00:02:51.450> name<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.049> go<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> report

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
a player's name and go on a report

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050 
a player's name and go on a report
player<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.400> there's<00:02:53.610> an<00:02:53.700> option<00:02:53.790> you

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
player and then there's an option you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.000 
player and then there's an option you
said<00:02:54.239> that's<00:02:54.570> called<00:02:54.840> boosting<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.890> is

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
said that's called boosting and this is

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.229 
said that's called boosting and this is
pretty<00:02:56.160> much<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:56.519> it's<00:02:56.640> meant<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.850> for

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
pretty much what it's meant for for

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.520 
pretty much what it's meant for for
players<00:02:57.450> doing<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.959> can<00:02:58.079> report<00:02:58.320> them

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
players doing this you can report them

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.590 
players doing this you can report them
so<00:02:59.070> it's<00:02:59.190> definitely<00:02:59.640> not<00:02:59.940> worth<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
so it's definitely not worth it and
