00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.750 

I'm<00:03:07.390> debating<00:03:07.600> on<00:03:08.080> whether<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.340> could<00:03:09.490> get<00:03:09.730> a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.730 
I'm debating on whether I could get a
shot<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.270> there<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.990> couldn't<00:03:11.380> from<00:03:11.590> that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
shot in there and I couldn't from that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.050 
shot in there and I couldn't from that
angle<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.340> knew<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> wind

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
angle and I knew that the that the wind

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.300 
angle and I knew that the that the wind
was<00:03:16.270> definitely<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:16.990> our<00:03:17.170> favor<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.770> we

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
was definitely not in our favor so we

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.250 
was definitely not in our favor so we
decided<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.730> pull<00:03:18.910> out<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.240> there<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.540> walk

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
decided to pull out of there and walk

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.040 
decided to pull out of there and walk
all<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.680> way<00:03:20.710> around<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:21.100> creek<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.930> come<00:03:22.930> in

all the way around the creek and come in

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.190 
all the way around the creek and come in
so<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.590> wind<00:03:23.800> is<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:23.980> our<00:03:24.250> advantage<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
so that the wind is in our advantage and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.190 
so that the wind is in our advantage and
and<00:03:26.200> try<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.160> get<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> clear<00:03:27.790> shot<00:03:27.820> on<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:29.080> other
