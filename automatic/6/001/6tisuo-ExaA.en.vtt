00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.220 
some railfanning is this road that I did
the<00:03:34.040> idea<00:03:34.400> was<00:03:34.609> trying<00:03:34.879> to<00:03:35.090> make<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.599> a<00:03:35.629> bit<00:03:36.200> of

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the idea was trying to make it a bit of

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.110 
the idea was trying to make it a bit of
a<00:03:36.909> unkempt<00:03:37.909> road<00:03:38.269> with<00:03:38.599> some<00:03:38.810> gravel<00:03:39.620> on<00:03:39.769> it

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
a unkempt road with some gravel on it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.180 
a unkempt road with some gravel on it
clearly<00:03:41.120> defined<00:03:41.599> lanes<00:03:41.959> but<00:03:42.379> obviously<00:03:42.920> not

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
clearly defined lanes but obviously not

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.099 
clearly defined lanes but obviously not
kept<00:03:43.459> up<00:03:43.639> with<00:03:43.700> very<00:03:44.120> much<00:03:44.359> due<00:03:44.629> to<00:03:44.810> little

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
kept up with very much due to little

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.830 
kept up with very much due to little
traffic<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:46.069> so<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.819> can<00:03:47.000> see<00:03:47.209> I've<00:03:47.450> got<00:03:47.629> some

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
traffic and so you can see I've got some

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.720 
traffic and so you can see I've got some
gravel<00:03:48.200> running<00:03:48.500> down<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.829> middle<00:03:48.950> here<00:03:49.519> and

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
gravel running down the middle here and

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.089 
gravel running down the middle here and
there's<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.970> few<00:03:50.239> bits<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.290> pieces<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:51.829> between

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
there's a few bits and pieces in between

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.830 
there's a few bits and pieces in between
lanes<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:53.000> then<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.269> course<00:03:53.480> we<00:03:53.629> have<00:03:53.810> our

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
lanes and then of course we have our

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.059 
lanes and then of course we have our
fall<00:03:54.260> leaves<00:03:54.560> everywhere<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:57.680> think<00:03:57.949> you

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
fall leaves everywhere and I think you

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.710 
fall leaves everywhere and I think you
can<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.669> tracks<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.209> laid<00:03:59.419> down<00:03:59.449> that

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
can see the tracks that I laid down that

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.610 
can see the tracks that I laid down that
was<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.079> bit<00:04:00.349> of<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:01.239> gray<00:04:02.239> wash<00:04:02.599> done<00:04:03.349> in<00:04:03.530> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
was a bit of a gray wash done in the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.670 
was a bit of a gray wash done in the
line<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.280> also<00:04:05.000> some<00:04:05.510> light<00:04:06.139> weathering

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
line and also some light weathering

00:04:06.680 --> 00:05:56.740 
line and also some light weathering
powders<00:04:07.129> used<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.549> get<00:04:07.669> that<00:04:07.849> effect

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.810
