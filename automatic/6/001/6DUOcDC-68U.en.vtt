00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.080
 today we will see how 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.240
 mount a cable tv antenna this cable 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 of which 1 tv will connect a 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.029
 antenna amplifier at the entrance of a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 tnt decoder 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.490
 the antenna amplifier is equipped with 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.260
 female connector type f1 high school and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.029
 the decoder's antenna input is a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.900
 9.5 mm diameter female connector 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.590
 of course we can find in the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.780
 trade cables to ride if we 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.930
 have a cable for example this one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.730
 that there are 9.5 connectors wrong and 9 5 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.149
 females 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 just put an adapter 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.770
 9.5 evil here and with the type end 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 f 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.120
 which would connect the two 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.670
 devices but if we want to mount a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.600
 cable of a particular length and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.329
 best quality 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.250
 so we will use a cable of 7 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.570
 millimeters in diameter it's cable 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 75 ohm antenna a 9.5 connector 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.320
 mm wrong and a f1 high school type connector 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
 for the assembly of the bus we are going to have 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.140
 need a ruler of a cutter of a 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.570
 cutting pliers of a wire stripper and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.920
 flat pliers to avoid damage 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.170
 the table I'm going to work on a 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.190
 cardboard sheet I start with 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.190
 disassemble the connector 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.180
 I think the hood on the table 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.750
 and I'm going to remove the sheath on 25 mm 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.900
 I do not press too hard with the cutter 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.560
 because we must not cut the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.750
 shielding now I take off the sheath to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.240
 using the cutting pliers while doing 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.540
 be careful not to cut the wires of the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.540
 armouring 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.250
 must now gather all the threads 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.549
 shielding together with the sheet 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.549
 alu 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.950
 I will remove the insulating part on 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.950
 12 mm with the wire stripper 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.819
 now i can ride my 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.819
 connectors 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720
 shielding 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.520
 folded outside the party 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.520
 shielded connector 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.550
 I will tighten with the help of the pliers 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.550
 flat 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.150
 and I saw the connector the hood of 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.150
 connector 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.560
 the first connector is mounted 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.530
 now we will go to 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.370
 f-type connectors for the connector 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.720
 type f 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:39.260
 I'm going to remove 15 mm of sheaths I'm doing 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.560
 be careful not to cut the wires of the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.560
 armouring 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.250
 to allow connectors better 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.890
 to screw myself I'll remove a whole 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.060
 small part of the plastic sheath 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.420
 with the cutter given a strong form 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.420
 conical 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.460
 now I flap the armor on the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.460
 sheath 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 and I remove the insulation on three minutes 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.330
 and now I can life that's my 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.330
 connectors 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.310
 I cut the shield that exceeds 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.870
 and I'm going to cut the central thread in 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.870
 leaving only 1 to 2 mm 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:12.759
 and here are the tv antenna cables have 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.759
 more secrets for you
