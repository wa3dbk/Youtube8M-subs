00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.059
 stupid 'taste of a very Brazilian fruit 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.599
 the rate 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.609
 everything takes advantage 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.949
 saving is exempt cashew cranberry jellies 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.549
 do not be surprised if you get so much appreciated mid-year 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.689
 the net profit of the nutshell lcc is the raw material for the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 preparation of compounds with high added value 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.470
 In Brazil, production is concentrated in the northeast 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.530
 the states of ceará piauí 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 Rio Grande do Norte are responsible for 93% of the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.180
 national production 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.010
 sebrae is investing in partnership with 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.620
 the brazilian foundation, embrapa and telemar in the agroindustrial process of the 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 cashew nuts with the processing of chestnut to be spared 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 already small producers organized in cooperatives and associations earn 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 quality scale who accesses the market 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 is social technology 'applicable to the small producer 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.390
 know some of the production process now 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.690
 That 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.540
 the drying of the perfect chestnuts in cement blocks the inter kingdoms 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.600
 reduce the humidity to around 8% after being cleaned. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.720
 stored in an airy and dry place. 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.690
 storage for up to one year 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.240
 processing 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 industrialization of cashew nuts begins with 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 approximately 20 minutes in high paradise 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.399
 after leaving the autoclaves the nuts go to the cut 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.320
 the work is preferably done in pairs a person operating machines 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.370
 cut and other helps to separate the almond from the chestnut 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:20.019
 now the mentor already without the shell will go through other steps of beneficiation 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.810
 to reduce the humidity it is necessary to put the almonds and doubles by 6/8 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.809
 hours 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:33.049
 after cooling for two to three hours follow the indicator 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:39.019
 this facilitates the next step of processing low visibility 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:45.139
 in this process the film removal is done first with the use of 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.729
 equipment 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.869
 presided over by the cable right in the hall 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.999
 and guarantees better final quality the reduction of the percentage of 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.999
 chestnuts 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.450
 in this step 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.050
 but a is separated into groups whose mother never delivers body to 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.549
 meet the demands of the buyer market 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.220
 the concepts of risk classification explanation of quality are 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.019
 determined by the Ministry of Agriculture are in accordance with the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 international standards 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.299
 leakages may already be 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.469
 currently the product and not hard is destined to the external market 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.439
 the packages are impermeable without closed lead being practically 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.289
 for the internal market, almonds receive another treatment 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.699
 after selecting they are made in quality name for approximately 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.299
 three minutes 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.279
 then go up the crossbar to remove the excess eye 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.779
 still hot are salty in words 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.949
 the minifactories of nuts are making the difference 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.139
 in the manual process the cpi quality and value is added 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.260
 with the aid of machines it is possible to have scale to compete 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.119
 improving the quality of life of these small producers is already a reality 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:19.849
 the brazilian bank foundation 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:20.799
 ingrate 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 Rita, she's bad. 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.100
 a genuinely Brazilian fruit generates employment and income 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 is increasingly the palate of consumers. 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.309
 small cashew nuts project 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.310
 social virginity for sustainable development
