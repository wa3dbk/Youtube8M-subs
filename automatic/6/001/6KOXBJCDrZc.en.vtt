it's<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.090> situation<00:05:49.300> where<00:05:49.960> somebody<00:05:50.289> feels

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
it's a situation where somebody feels

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.310

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
like they have to try to mold you into

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.939

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
appropriate that probably is not for you

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.409 
appropriate that probably is not for you
because<00:05:59.789> you're<00:06:00.789> not<00:06:00.970> going<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.210> fill

yourself you're not going to feel

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.810

accepted<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:03.160> you're<00:06:03.310> not<00:06:03.430> going<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.669> feel

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
accepted and you're not going to feel

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.550

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
comfortable so I feel like if it's a

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.680 
comfortable so I feel like if it's a
situation<00:06:05.800> where<00:06:06.340> you<00:06:06.460> have<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:06.820> do<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.210> you

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
situation where you have to do that you

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.180 
situation where you have to do that you
can't<00:06:07.930> be<00:06:08.080> yourself<00:06:08.199> you<00:06:08.620> can't<00:06:08.860> you<00:06:09.039> know

a position or whatever it's probably not

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.360 
a position or whatever it's probably not
for<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:16.780> someone<00:06:17.440> needs<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.860> look<00:06:18.010> into
