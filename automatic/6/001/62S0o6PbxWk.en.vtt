00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.959
 the sensors clean it because a static electricity platform is useful 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.760
 and every time I 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.880
 I change an eye for many precautions that obviously take 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.699
 first will not end up firing 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.119
 for some reason that I do not know people take a picture with the angular and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.210
 they will quickly remove the mule and with the pele pacers another with the tel 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.829
 the static charger defender and lis is exhorted 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 and it takes 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 everything there is in the area 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.899
 this is the first the second 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.050
 note that the cameras that the digital bodies are selling 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.580
 with low light variables 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.940
 percent 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 if they were strengthened 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.640
 they would still take more time in dirty sensors 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 but of course if I go to a closed compartment 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.440
 I put a plunger 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.980
 depression 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 that is no more than meet that 8 70 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.300
 what the optical component when I put the 28 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.260
 the space which provides tax advantages for the own 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.600
 it generates a current flow inside 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.160
 where they are counted 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.270
 and move the dust back and forth even though it is not necessary to change the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.630
 optics to have problems with sex 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.760
 it is only necessary that he is also vocal after making a disc 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.090
 it feeds systems 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.080
 Obviously the best one is olympus 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.060
 i another system that is also very good 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.420
 is the discounted 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.060
 and it is that once for me I like that impulse more than cleaning the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.110
 center 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.110
 because you come back from a work day 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.940
 and it turns out that you have polo 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.450
 in all the files 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.370
 but it always has the same place 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.340
 because the po cost the wounded 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.610
 and sometimes you get 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.909
 a white cardboard 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.750
 this is a shot that you generate a file 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.450
 with the same powder 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.590
 you create a setback 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.910
 i apply it to all zip and rar files 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.040
 I was whistling the whole beto 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.860
 It's like a mask 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.929
 generation against ninja type 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.439
 if you eliminate the pole of all 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.279
 only in the case that 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.319
 in which the shot and another has moved a little bit the pole that 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.059
 so 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.309
 from a small point then they have two 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:18.909
 I compare 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.669
 for making analogies 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.370
 compared that same cell with a grain of salt 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.209
 in time to a grain of salt of silver came to him 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.279
 I was very affected 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.790
 and then the developer who took care of rusty and instead doing it 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.519
 today what is happening is that when a button arrives 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.839
 to that same city 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 that same city makes it an electron 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:53.019
 is electron comes out with greater by less intensity depending on the intensity 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.269
 light 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.689
 that intensity asad through a micron perimeter 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.279
 and the quality 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.159
 i once the calibrated 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.059
 a goal in favor 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.190
 of the camera 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.600
 says this amount and intensity of light will correspond 1 0 0 0 1 1 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.279
 a final value 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.749
 then that floor he has s / 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.209
 and obviously that image 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.030
 what comes out 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.629
 from that sensor 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.559
 it is anthological 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.439
 then the one that in the case of lawns 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.409
 airbus has yes that this year 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.489
 of the tc 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.510
 is the abc that is the digital analog converter 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.809
 that makes all of that turn into a file 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.069
 is going to stop in the case of the cameras let's say SLR 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:44.669
 p 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.159
 a little professional 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.939
 goes down woman 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:48.969
 that lighten 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.639
 quickly the sensor for what is ready to capture another image 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.839
 and at the same time it gives time to the card 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.759
 the temporary memory device until it is able to capture all this 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.159
 information 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.959
 that makes the process much easier 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.629
 in the case of cem mons all that management that is done inside 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.909
 every cell 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.349
 It also has a signal amplifier and also has a convert 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:18.719
 therefore of the sel music saleh 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 the direct digital file 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.599
 fix t 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.550
 it is always generated by amplification 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.210
 it is not the same to listen to a music system, continuous low volume 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.469
 listen to the music with impressive quality 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.449
 adp and giving the amplifier 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.719
 when amplifies music is mixed with the mobile 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.719
 when amplifying the electrical signal is amplified 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.490
 i mixes with the noise 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.110
 percent and that does the ccd the ccd in day all information 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.340
 although it is positive 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.080
 and it makes a single sound amplification 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.499
 the cem mons makes an amplification ports 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.789
 it is clear that the cem voices much faster because the whole management the cedh 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.749
 but generates more 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.240
 that's the problem 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.510
 by which some rooms p more prestigious brands 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.740
 They have decided on the CCB 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.759
 and others have decided on the cebs 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.289
 another thing that caught my attention powerfully with a 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.639
 antecedent with digital technology was 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.449
 because I had to change the movie 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.620
 to work with 100 with 200 or 400 iso 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.529
 and not have to change center 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:33.559
 to change 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.120
 the sensibility 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.110
 So it is not more or less 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.010
 p 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.120
 that when I work with people 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.360
 there are points or signal amplification the signal is always amplified 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.849
 when I work with 200 the amplification is double and when I worked with 400 the 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.599
 amplification is four times more 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:54.759
 what happen 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.580
 what as I gain sensitivity 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.129
 contains digital technology 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.450
 I'm going to have to amplify the signal 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.240
 and that generates noise 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.460
 and unfortunately even in some textbooks 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.719
 coincident 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.789
 at the level of analogy 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.160
 the amount of grain that produced in the sensitivity is higher in film 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.169
 they confuse the noise 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.270
 with the grain 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.569
 they have nothing 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.439
 the grain is the brush and the noise is an artifact of the image
