00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.910 
trying to fight your way through when
you<00:01:39.750> end<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.079> no<00:01:40.290> money<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> other

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
you end up with no money on the other

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
you end up with no money on the other
end<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.729> did<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:42.960> nearly

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
end just like I did so we're nearly

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
end just like I did so we're nearly
there<00:01:43.229> nearly<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.220> thousand<00:01:44.700> points<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
there nearly a two thousand points and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
there nearly a two thousand points and
then<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.680> exactly<00:01:47.070> how<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> do

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
then we can show you exactly how to do

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.109 
then we can show you exactly how to do
the<00:01:47.729> first<00:01:47.880> part<00:01:48.590> which<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.130> thought<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the first part which is I thought the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
the first part which is I thought the
first<00:01:51.329> part<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> hardest<00:01:52.530> part<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
first part was the hardest part of this

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
first part was the hardest part of this
the<00:01:53.460> next<00:01:53.820> part<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.299> nice<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.229> easy<00:01:55.380> resist

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the next part was nice and easy resist

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.310 
the next part was nice and easy resist
holding<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> pack<00:01:56.969> punch<00:01:57.270> room<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.079> get

your<00:01:58.469> points<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.890> need<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.640> go

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
your points that you need so there we go

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.399 
your points that you need so there we go
two<00:02:02.820> thousand<00:02:03.390> points<00:02:03.540> head<00:02:04.049> around<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
two thousand points head around the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
two thousand points head around the
corner<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> where<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
corner and this is where we do the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.339 
corner and this is where we do the
double<00:02:07.079> jump<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:07.409> you'll<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:09.229> soon<00:02:10.229> as
