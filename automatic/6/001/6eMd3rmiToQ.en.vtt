headset<00:00:07.319> into<00:00:08.010> an<00:00:08.610> integrated<00:00:08.880> deck<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
headset into an integrated deck and the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.810 
headset into an integrated deck and the
difference<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:10.830> between<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
difference is just between that and a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.759 
difference is just between that and a
normal<00:00:12.000> headset

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
normal headset

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.709 
normal headset
we've<00:00:13.769> got<00:00:13.920> sacrifice<00:00:14.400> bundle<00:00:14.820> deck<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.330> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
we've got sacrifice bundle deck here and

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.439 
we've got sacrifice bundle deck here and
the<00:00:16.109> main<00:00:16.260> thing<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.470> need<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:17.010> about

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
the main thing you need to know about

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.700 
the main thing you need to know about
installing<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> integrated<00:00:18.960> headsets<00:00:19.410> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
installing the integrated headsets is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.259 
installing the integrated headsets is
that<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.000> bearings<00:00:22.220> on<00:00:23.220> your<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:24.210> your

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
that the the bearings on your on your

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
that the the bearings on your on your
headset<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:24.990> actually<00:00:25.320> fit<00:00:25.560> directly<00:00:25.830> into

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
headset they actually fit directly into

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.730 
headset they actually fit directly into
the<00:00:26.519> cups<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> deck<00:00:28.230> head<00:00:28.470> tube

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the cups that are in the deck head tube

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.089 
the cups that are in the deck head tube
whereas<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> standard<00:00:30.150> deck<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.560> district

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
whereas a standard deck like a district

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.100 
whereas a standard deck like a district
deck<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.820> instance<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.660> actually<00:00:33.930> has

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
deck here for instance it actually has

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.380 
deck here for instance it actually has
headset<00:00:34.590> cups<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.460> you'll<00:00:35.670> install<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
headset cups but you'll install the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.560 
headset cups but you'll install the
bearings<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.850> we're<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.000> intubated<00:00:39.300> deck

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bearings into we're on an intubated deck

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720 
bearings into we're on an intubated deck
the<00:00:39.690> domes<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.110> straight<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> head<00:00:41.489> tube

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the domes go straight into the head tube

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.049 
the domes go straight into the head tube
so<00:00:42.329> there's<00:00:42.480> no<00:00:42.660> need<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:44.190> headset

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so there's no need for these headset

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.990 
so there's no need for these headset
cups<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.280> you'll<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.610> you'll<00:00:47.850> have

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
cups so what you'll have is you'll have

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
cups so what you'll have is you'll have
like<00:00:48.180> five<00:00:48.510> pieces<00:00:48.809> you'll<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> crown

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
like five pieces you'll have a crown

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.250 
like five pieces you'll have a crown
right<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> bottom<00:00:50.640> you'll<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> bottom

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
right at the bottom you'll have a bottom

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.979 
right at the bottom you'll have a bottom
bearing<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:53.160> bearing<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> crown<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
bearing top bearing for the crown we to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
bearing top bearing for the crown we to
the<00:00:55.110> top<00:00:55.379> which<00:00:55.860> sits<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.250> top<00:00:56.460> bearing<00:00:56.850> keeps

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the top which sits in top bearing keeps

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.299 
the top which sits in top bearing keeps
the<00:00:57.539> forks<00:00:57.809> nice<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> tight<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.190> you'll
