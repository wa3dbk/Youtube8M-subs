00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.829
 quantities of noticeable projects what else 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.559

 this he needs to make a long 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 the journey to become one or another of the temple 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.380
 the plot is quite interesting in itself 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.039
 on ancient greek legends and myths 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.419

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.159
 authenticity and coach 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.010
 the main thing is fantastic 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.180

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.539

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.389
 such an onslaught 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.539
 any system remained as it was 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.979
