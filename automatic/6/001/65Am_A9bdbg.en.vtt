00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello everyone before we get to 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.900
 the next lesson is the pattern that I 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.080
 promised then Iâ€™ll tell you very much 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.410
 good technique surely many know 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 here's how to knit in two threads from one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.439
 a tangle but a beginner of course for sure 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 don't know therefore just in case 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.119
 I'll tell you quickly means one thread 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 it goes with us that it goes like this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.170
 unwinding of the coil's Tanya who 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.180
 you find usually somewhere outside here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.760
 this thread is you one second thread 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 very tricky way here in every hank 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 there are balls here such holes 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.719
 the system is not wound tangle here in one 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.960
 thrust out of these holes and 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.809
 find 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 try any thread somewhere in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.860
 depth and from it pull out any 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.260
 the tip and this tip well i mean if 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.830
 you pull out all the house dots small yes 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.869
 nothing terrible in the forehead there unwind 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.650
 but they are. ponytail you will find 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.580
 and this tail will serve you 2 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.420
 thread that is, from the coil we go out 2 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 strings at once than convenient but it is clear that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.720
 more convenient to knit from one ball they are from 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.299
 two out of four there or there for example 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.369
 that is, if you need something in 4 threads 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.020
 knit then you can take one tangle so 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 way and 2 tangle let you be 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.930
 knit 4 stitches but of two balls 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.140
 and the second is very convenient and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.000
 accordingly it is of course useful 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.329
 what do you when you finish that one 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.320
 ball you do not have tails of yarn 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.090
 but that is something that each hank but 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.430
 it is clear that the car somehow there them 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.990
 shake and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.289
 but they can't really figure out 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.270
 the length that is here anyway you 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.019
 there will be some tails and pieces and there 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.940
 here and the segment to these threads here 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.830
 as we of course love to knit without 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.459
 tails without knots then 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.890
 accordingly in this way even if 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.230
 you knit there in two threads and when you have 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.890
 tangle ends with you actually 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.470
 saying ends they all immediately here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.700
 just left such a loop that's well 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.970
 the next lesson will tell about this one 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.970
 pattern
