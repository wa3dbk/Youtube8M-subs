00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
bleach but as the process went on I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.210 
bleach but as the process went on I
added<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.410> little<00:03:15.340> bit<00:03:15.550> more<00:03:15.820> every<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.780> often

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.050 

they're<00:03:21.220> gonna<00:03:21.310> want<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.670> completely

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
they're gonna want to completely

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.000 
they're gonna want to completely
submerge<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.050> solution<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.710> you'll

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
submerge it in the solution and you'll

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.200 
submerge it in the solution and you'll
have<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.250> leave<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.520> there<00:03:24.550> for<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.910> couple<00:03:24.970> of

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
have to leave it there for a couple of

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.660 
have to leave it there for a couple of
hours

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.850 

then<00:03:28.330> while<00:03:28.480> you're<00:03:28.630> waiting<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.110> can<00:03:29.140> cook

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
then while you're waiting you can cook

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.240 
then while you're waiting you can cook
some<00:03:30.099> oatmeal<00:03:30.310> or<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:31.450> some<00:03:31.630> laundry<00:03:31.840> or<00:03:32.650> read

some oatmeal or do some laundry or read
a<00:03:33.280> magazine<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:34.360> then<00:03:34.870> check<00:03:35.140> on<00:03:35.290> your<00:03:35.410> jacket

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.380 
a magazine and then check on your jacket
and<00:03:36.989> then<00:03:37.989> burn<00:03:38.380> yourself<00:03:38.800> on<00:03:38.920> some<00:03:39.099> oatmeal

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
and then burn yourself on some oatmeal

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.660 
and then burn yourself on some oatmeal
and<00:03:40.390> then<00:03:40.630> check<00:03:40.930> your<00:03:41.050> jacket<00:03:41.170> again<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:42.520> can

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
and then check your jacket again you can

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
and then check your jacket again you can
see<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:42.849> it's<00:03:43.090> getting<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.360> little<00:03:43.569> bit

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
see that it's getting a little bit

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.090 
see that it's getting a little bit
lighter<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.230> not<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> whole<00:03:44.590> lot<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:44.860> being

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
lighter but not a whole lot is being

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.180 
lighter but not a whole lot is being
done<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:45.910> at<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:46.300> point<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:47.040> put<00:03:48.040> more

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
done so I think at this point I put more

00:03:48.190 --> 00:04:01.470 
done so I think at this point I put more
bleach<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.610> then<00:04:00.730> apparently<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.239> change

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
bleach in and then apparently you change

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.610 
bleach in and then apparently you change
your<00:04:01.630> shirt<00:04:01.750> while<00:04:01.959> you're<00:04:02.080> waiting<00:04:02.319> as<00:04:02.440> well

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
your shirt while you're waiting as well

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.670 
your shirt while you're waiting as well
so<00:04:03.489> this<00:04:03.580> is<00:04:03.730> after<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:04.060> couple<00:04:04.300> of<00:04:04.420> hours<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.620> to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
so this is after a couple of hours so to

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.140 
so this is after a couple of hours so to
get<00:04:11.830> all<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.250> bleach<00:04:12.459> out<00:04:12.670> your<00:04:12.910> knees<00:04:13.120> a

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.940 
water overnight this is after the
patient<00:04:37.000> Rancic's<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.630> wasn't<00:04:38.560> very<00:04:38.710> happy

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
patient Rancic's I wasn't very happy

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.190 
patient Rancic's I wasn't very happy
with<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.340> way<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:39.789> fit<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.360> felt<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.080> it

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
with the way that it fit I felt that it

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.500 
with the way that it fit I felt that it
was<00:04:41.289> still<00:04:41.560> boxy<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.340> wasn't<00:04:42.700> as<00:04:42.880> stiff<00:04:43.300> I

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
was still boxy it wasn't as stiff I

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.070 
was still boxy it wasn't as stiff I
think<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.930> bleach<00:04:44.169> softened<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.710> fabric

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.080 

but<00:04:49.080> after<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.380> had<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.890> few<00:04:50.160> adjustments

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
but after I had a few adjustments

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.690 
but after I had a few adjustments
I<00:04:51.120> took<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.050> sides<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> little<00:04:52.770> bit<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.130> added

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
I took the sides in a little bit I added

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.780
