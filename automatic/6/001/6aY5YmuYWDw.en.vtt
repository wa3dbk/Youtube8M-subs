playing<00:00:06.629> some<00:00:06.899> gravity<00:00:07.230> beetle<00:00:07.470> today<00:00:08.719> in

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
playing some gravity beetle today in

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.860 
playing some gravity beetle today in
megaman<00:00:10.260> x3<00:00:10.969> according<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.000> our<00:00:12.120> map<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:12.660> it

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
megaman x3 according to our map here it

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209 
megaman x3 according to our map here it
looks<00:00:13.110> like<00:00:13.200> gravity<00:00:13.559> beetles<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:13.950> shards<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
looks like gravity beetles and shards of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.760 
looks like gravity beetles and shards of
the<00:00:14.309> airport<00:00:15.049> there's<00:00:16.049> no<00:00:16.230> planes<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.650> this

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the airport there's no planes in this

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.800 
the airport there's no planes in this
level<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.220> can't<00:00:17.550> say<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:17.850> sure<00:00:18.060> maybe

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
level so I can't say for sure maybe

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.830 
level so I can't say for sure maybe
we're<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> humongous<00:00:20.070> playing<00:00:20.340> I

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
we're on just a humongous playing I

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.769 
we're on just a humongous playing I
don't<00:00:21.840> know<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.539> something

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
a little different today I'm going to be

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.310 
a little different today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:28.890> off<00:00:29.130> some<00:00:29.310> weapons<00:00:29.869> we<00:00:30.869> only<00:00:31.019> have

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
showing off some weapons we only have

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
showing off some weapons we only have
two<00:00:31.590> weapons<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.219> worth<00:00:32.369> anything<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
two weapons that are worth anything so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.360 
two weapons that are worth anything so
I'm<00:00:33.290> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.410> using<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> two

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I'm going to be using those to the two

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
I'm going to be using those to the two
weapons<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.730> them<00:00:38.790> talking<00:00:39.120> about<00:00:39.360> are<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
weapons on them talking about are the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.830 
weapons on them talking about are the
parasite<00:00:40.110> bomb<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.100> frost<00:00:41.370> shield<00:00:41.840> which

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
parasite bomb and the frost shield which

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
parasite bomb and the frost shield which
I'm<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> call<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> ice<00:00:43.710> fang<00:00:43.980> maybe<00:00:44.340> if

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I'm going to call the ice fang maybe if

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.369 
I'm going to call the ice fang maybe if
I<00:00:44.850> forget<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.660> called<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> frost<00:00:46.170> yield

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I forget that is called a frost yield

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.290 
I forget that is called a frost yield
because<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> shield<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.640> but

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because it's not a shield at all but

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
because it's not a shield at all but
anyways<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> parasitic<00:00:50.309> balm

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
anyways so this is a parasitic balm

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
anyways so this is a parasitic balm
you'll<00:00:50.910> remember<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> end<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.539> blast

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you'll remember at the end of blast

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
you'll remember at the end of blast
Hornet<00:00:52.350> stage<00:00:52.590> i<00:00:52.800> trashed<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> parasitic

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
Hornet stage i trashed the parasitic

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.389 
Hornet stage i trashed the parasitic
bomb<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> said<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.420> garbage<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
bomb and said it was garbage and it's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.060 
bomb and said it was garbage and it's
actually<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.289> but<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.469> i'm<00:00:58.620> using<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
actually all right but now i'm using the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually all right but now i'm using the
the<00:00:59.370> frost<00:00:59.640> shield<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> ever<00:01:01.109> watched

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the frost shield and if you ever watched

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
the frost shield and if you ever watched
any<00:01:01.500> speedruns<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> megaman<00:01:02.520> x3<00:01:03.110> you've

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
any speedruns to megaman x3 you've

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
any speedruns to megaman x3 you've
probably<00:01:04.229> seen<00:01:04.439> them<00:01:04.559> use<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> item<00:01:05.180> watch

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
probably seen them use this item watch

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.250 
probably seen them use this item watch
this<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.780> about<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> do

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
this here I'm think about what to do

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
this here I'm think about what to do
bang<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.460> where<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.030> gun

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
bang I don't know where you get that gun

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.350 
bang I don't know where you get that gun
guy<00:01:09.600> nails<00:01:09.840> me<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.320> jackass<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.180> see

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
guy nails me a jackass but you you see

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.149 
guy nails me a jackass but you you see
how<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> parasitic<00:01:13.380> bomb<00:01:13.530> works<00:01:13.740> right<00:01:13.979> there

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
how the parasitic bomb works right there

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.999 
how the parasitic bomb works right there
it<00:01:14.460> kind<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.110> makes<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.350> enemies<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> blow

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it kind of makes other enemies of blow

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.840 
it kind of makes other enemies of blow
up<00:01:17.159> into<00:01:17.280> other<00:01:17.460> enemies<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.700> our

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
up into other enemies so here we get our

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.090 
up into other enemies so here we get our
our<00:01:21.659> next<00:01:21.960> heart<00:01:22.140> tank<00:01:22.320> there's<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
our next heart tank there's actually a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
our next heart tank there's actually a
wall<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.880> until<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> beat<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
wall right there until you beat a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
wall right there until you beat a
certain<00:01:25.680> stage<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.790> even<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:27.060> what

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

was like oh that falls down so yeah the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.390 
was like oh that falls down so yeah the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
showing off how after someone's hit with

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.160 
showing off how after someone's hit with
the<00:01:42.960> parasitic<00:01:43.409> ball<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.869> just<00:01:45.869> kind<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the parasitic ball you can just kind of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.609 
the parasitic ball you can just kind of
hang<00:01:46.740> around<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.189> won't<00:01:47.340> hurt<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> anymore

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
hang around they won't hurt you anymore

hang around they won't hurt you anymore
every<00:01:49.619> enemy<00:01:49.799> reacts<00:01:50.520> differently<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.149> the

every enemy reacts differently to the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.899

hardest first boss to fight would

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.080 
hardest first boss to fight would
probably<00:05:07.050> be<00:05:07.230> a<00:05:08.030> bolt<00:05:09.030> catfish<00:05:09.650> but<00:05:10.650> no<00:05:10.860> no<00:05:11.640> it

he throws one lightning ball and then
it'll<00:05:33.360> throw

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
it'll throw

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.770 
it'll throw
the<00:05:33.860> one<00:05:34.039> and<00:05:34.580> if<00:05:34.759> you<00:05:34.849> don't<00:05:35.030> know<00:05:35.270> exactly

the one and if you don't know exactly

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.680 
the one and if you don't know exactly
how<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.020> dodge<00:05:36.319> them<00:05:36.560> it's<00:05:37.340> just<00:05:37.759> it's<00:05:38.599> just

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
how to dodge them it's just it's just

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
and then even there look I get hit by

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.279 
and then even there look I get hit by
one<00:05:40.400> it<00:05:40.639> tastes<00:05:40.789> like<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:41.000> third<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.240> my<00:05:41.389> HP<00:05:43.270> man

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
one it tastes like a third of my HP man

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.570 
one it tastes like a third of my HP man
but<00:05:45.289> yeah<00:05:45.470> that's<00:05:45.800> how<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:45.979> dodge<00:05:46.220> it<00:05:46.400> when<00:05:46.520> he

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
but yeah that's how you dodge it when he

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.149 
but yeah that's how you dodge it when he
throws<00:05:46.639> too<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.449> took<00:05:47.690> me<00:05:47.870> like<00:05:48.020> it<00:05:48.830> took<00:05:48.979> me<00:05:49.129> a

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
throws too it took me like it took me a

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.270 
throws too it took me like it took me a
few<00:05:49.370> tries<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.759> figure<00:05:49.909> that<00:05:50.090> out<00:05:51.099> but<00:05:52.099> then

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
few tries to figure that out but then

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.950 
few tries to figure that out but then
when<00:05:52.460> he<00:05:52.520> gets<00:05:52.669> into<00:05:52.819> his<00:05:52.970> desperation<00:05:53.509> attack

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
when he gets into his desperation attack

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.559 
when he gets into his desperation attack
right<00:05:54.169> here<00:05:54.440> he<00:05:55.370> pulls<00:05:55.639> out<00:05:55.759> this<00:05:55.879> big<00:05:56.180> black

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.790 
you will get hit and doing those small
jumps<00:06:02.389> like<00:06:02.509> that<00:06:02.780> off<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.139> wall<00:06:03.319> to<00:06:03.620> get<00:06:03.770> to

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
jumps like that off the wall to get to

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.120 
jumps like that off the wall to get to
get<00:06:04.310> through<00:06:04.550> him<00:06:04.729> and<00:06:04.759> that<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.479> that<00:06:05.509> thing

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
get through him and that and that thing

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.249 
get through him and that and that thing
it's<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.340> pretty<00:06:08.060> challenging<00:06:08.599> it's<00:06:08.780> easy<00:06:08.990> to

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
it's a pretty challenging it's easy to

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.550 
it's a pretty challenging it's easy to
not<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:10.159> not<00:06:10.190> do<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.550> right<00:06:10.880> here<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.690> get<00:06:11.930> hit<00:06:12.169> to

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
not to not do it right here I get hit to

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.290 
not to not do it right here I get hit to
show<00:06:12.770> just<00:06:13.009> how<00:06:13.130> much<00:06:13.310> damage<00:06:13.580> that<00:06:13.940> actually

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
show just how much damage that actually

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.510 
show just how much damage that actually
does<00:06:14.509> if<00:06:15.500> we<00:06:15.650> didn't<00:06:15.830> have<00:06:15.889> any<00:06:16.099> heart<00:06:16.310> tank

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
does if we didn't have any heart tank

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.059 
does if we didn't have any heart tank
 I<00:06:16.880> think<00:06:17.270> that<00:06:17.720> would<00:06:17.840> probably

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
 I think that would probably

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.089 
 I think that would probably
probably<00:06:19.069> do<00:06:19.340> it<00:06:19.370> in<00:06:19.550> for<00:06:19.789> X<00:06:19.909> so<00:06:20.470> yeah<00:06:21.470> just<00:06:21.889> two

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
probably do it in for X so yeah just two

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.830 
probably do it in for X so yeah just two
hits<00:06:22.310> and<00:06:22.789> he'd<00:06:22.970> be<00:06:23.090> dead<00:06:23.300> if<00:06:23.509> you<00:06:23.539> tried<00:06:23.810> to

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
hits and he'd be dead if you tried to

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.830 
hits and he'd be dead if you tried to
fight<00:06:24.139> this<00:06:24.259> guy<00:06:24.440> first<00:06:25.990> this<00:06:26.990> guy<00:06:27.169> this<00:06:27.949> guy

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
fight this guy first this guy this guy

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.709 
fight this guy first this guy this guy
so<00:06:29.840> yeah<00:06:30.020> grab<00:06:31.009> that's<00:06:31.340> gravity<00:06:31.639> beetle<00:06:32.030> it

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:32.719 
so yeah grab that's gravity beetle it

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.180 
so yeah grab that's gravity beetle it
looks<00:06:32.960> like<00:06:33.020> we<00:06:33.229> are<00:06:33.259> on<00:06:33.590> an<00:06:33.710> airplane<00:06:33.949> because

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
looks like we are on an airplane because

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.439 
looks like we are on an airplane because
look<00:06:34.460> at<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.610> background<00:06:35.000> moving<00:06:35.300> there<00:06:35.419> in

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449 
look at the background moving there in

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.339 
look at the background moving there in
the<00:06:35.599> background<00:06:36.370> and<00:06:37.370> then<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.759> right<00:06:38.539> okay

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
the background and then the right okay

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:44.040 
the background and then the right okay
um<00:06:39.800> so<00:06:40.370> yeah<00:06:41.560> it<00:06:42.560> says<00:06:42.860> a<00:06:42.889> gravity<00:06:43.669> will

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
um so yeah it says a gravity will

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.980 
um so yeah it says a gravity will
gravity<00:06:45.050> well<00:06:45.229> is<00:06:45.560> in<00:06:46.310> an<00:06:46.400> okay<00:06:46.699> item<00:06:46.969> I<00:06:47.300> think

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
gravity well is in an okay item I think

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.240 
gravity well is in an okay item I think
they<00:06:48.080> kind<00:06:48.199> of<00:06:48.289> phoned<00:06:48.500> it<00:06:48.590> in<00:06:48.680> on<00:06:48.830> that<00:06:48.919> 3d

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
they kind of phoned it in on that 3d

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.249 
they kind of phoned it in on that 3d
animation<00:06:49.729> but<00:06:49.940> will<00:06:50.090> Morgan<00:06:50.389> ap<00:06:50.569> really<00:06:50.840> it's

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:51.259 
animation but will Morgan ap really it's

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.059 
animation but will Morgan ap really it's
just<00:06:51.349> a<00:06:51.500> sphere<00:06:52.870> it's<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:54.169> kind<00:06:54.770> of<00:06:54.830> sucks

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
just a sphere it's a kind of sucks

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.649 
just a sphere it's a kind of sucks
because<00:06:55.250> it<00:06:55.490> takes<00:06:55.639> so<00:06:55.759> long<00:06:55.969> to<00:06:56.029> kill<00:06:56.330> enemies

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
because it takes so long to kill enemies

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:58.059 
because it takes so long to kill enemies
but<00:06:57.020> it<00:06:57.169> will<00:06:57.319> kill<00:06:57.500> everything<00:06:57.770> on<00:06:57.979> the

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
but it will kill everything on the

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.360 
but it will kill everything on the
screen<00:06:58.419> it<00:06:59.419> just<00:06:59.630> takes<00:06:59.840> a<00:06:59.930> while<00:07:00.340> get<00:07:01.340> a

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
screen it just takes a while get a

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.110 
screen it just takes a while get a
password<00:07:01.639> why<00:07:02.150> not<00:07:02.330> I<00:07:02.539> love<00:07:02.960> passwords<00:07:05.680> so<00:07:06.680> on

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
password why not I love passwords so on

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.390 
password why not I love passwords so on
only<00:07:09.120> three<00:07:09.300> bosses<00:07:09.480> left<00:07:09.840> next<00:07:10.770> time<00:07:10.950> I<00:07:10.980> think

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
only three bosses left next time I think

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.900 
only three bosses left next time I think
we'll<00:07:11.550> go<00:07:11.700> to<00:07:12.560> you<00:07:13.560> the<00:07:13.860> sea<00:07:14.160> horse<00:07:14.460> or<00:07:15.420> a<00:07:16.910> boat

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
we'll go to you the sea horse or a boat

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.710 
we'll go to you the sea horse or a boat
catfish<00:07:18.920> we'll<00:07:19.920> see<00:07:20.070> you<00:07:20.160> then<00:07:20.190> it<00:07:20.720> but

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
catfish we'll see you then it but

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.800 
catfish we'll see you then it but
