00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
how to do that we'll start off by making

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.299 
how to do that we'll start off by making
a<00:00:27.359> canvass<00:00:28.670> around<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:31.170> size<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.070> tile

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a canvass around the size of the tile

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.080 
a canvass around the size of the tile
that<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.079> 300<00:00:34.770> pixels

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.010 

okay<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.250> then<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> load<00:00:41.790> an<00:00:42.719> image

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
okay and then you want to load an image

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.000 
okay and then you want to load an image
to<00:00:43.500> layer<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> import<00:00:45.149> image<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> layer

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
to layer so go to import image to layer

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
to layer so go to import image to layer
and<00:00:47.010> select<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> image<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> want<00:00:48.450> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to zoom in so that it fills up the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.020 
to zoom in so that it fills up the
entire<00:01:00.809> screen

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
entire screen

and here comes the important part we're
gonna<00:01:08.100> duplicate<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.320> four<00:01:10.320> times<00:01:12.740> okay<00:01:13.740> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
gonna duplicate this four times okay so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.490 
gonna duplicate this four times okay so
I'm<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:15.500> four<00:01:16.500> duplicates<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.130> total

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
I'm gonna have four duplicates in total

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.679 
I'm gonna have four duplicates in total
plus<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> original<00:01:19.820> I'm<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:21.000> hide<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> top

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
plus the original I'm gonna hide the top

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.910 
plus the original I'm gonna hide the top
one<00:01:23.570> will<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.869> hide<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> top

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
one will actually hide out for the top

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.490 
one will actually hide out for the top
ones<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.259> then<00:01:28.259> we're<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.470> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
ones for now then we're going to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.819 
ones for now then we're going to
transform<00:01:29.060> layer<00:01:30.060> contents<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.930> move<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
transform layer contents and move the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
transform layer contents and move the
bottom<00:01:32.189> layer<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> lower<00:01:33.600> left

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
bottom layer down to the lower left

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.520 
bottom layer down to the lower left
corner

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.950 

and<00:01:38.530> hide<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.890> next<00:01:39.190> layer<00:01:39.430> do<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.450> same<00:01:40.780> to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
and hide the next layer do the same to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.750 
and hide the next layer do the same to
that<00:01:41.140> except<00:01:41.500> move<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.950> bottom<00:01:42.070> right

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.030 

it's<00:01:45.760> important<00:01:46.210> that<00:01:46.240> each<00:01:46.570> edge<00:01:46.870> matches<00:01:47.530> up

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.480 

as<00:01:51.040> close<00:01:51.310> as<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.580> can<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.040> we're<00:01:54.220> just<00:01:54.340> going

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
as close as you can and we're just going

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.830 
as close as you can and we're just going
to<00:01:54.580> keep<00:01:54.700> doing<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.060> until<00:01:55.360> we<00:01:55.570> get<00:01:55.660> all<00:01:55.810> our

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
to keep doing this until we get all our

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.130 
to keep doing this until we get all our
corners<00:01:56.320> situated<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:01.150> you<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:01.780> see<00:02:01.960> this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
corners situated and you can see this

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.020 
corners situated and you can see this
corner<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.680> meeting<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.220> very<00:02:03.610> corner<00:02:04.000> of

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
corner is meeting the very corner of

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:17.720 
corner is meeting the very corner of
each<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.420> these<00:02:04.510> two<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.920> seams<00:02:06.250> line<00:02:06.520> up

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.790 

okay<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.520> got<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.819> all<00:02:20.970> set<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.620> can

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
okay so that we got that all set you can

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.110 
okay so that we got that all set you can
see<00:02:23.099> where<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> seam<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:25.849> kind<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
see where the seam is on kind of like a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.990 
see where the seam is on kind of like a
crosshair<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> center<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.400> obviously<00:02:29.819> we

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
crosshair in the center and obviously we

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.940 
crosshair in the center and obviously we
don't<00:02:30.150> want<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.629> now<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> reason<00:02:31.739> we're

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
don't want that now the reason we're

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.890 
don't want that now the reason we're
doing<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:32.970> these<00:02:33.209> edges

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.210 

duplicate<00:02:36.900> each<00:02:37.019> other<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.440> each<00:02:37.530> side<00:02:37.800> so

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
duplicate each other and each side so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.920 
duplicate each other and each side so
right<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.060> always<00:02:39.269> gonna<00:02:39.510> match<00:02:39.690> up

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
right here it's always gonna match up

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.979 
right here it's always gonna match up
over<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.760> bottom<00:02:42.150> will<00:02:42.599> always<00:02:42.810> match

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
over here the bottom will always match

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.949 
over here the bottom will always match
up<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.380> top<00:02:43.590> now<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:45.390> just<00:02:45.630> got<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.780> take

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
up to the top now we just got to take

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.380 
up to the top now we just got to take
care<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.319> center<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.610> that's<00:02:47.700> why<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.000> have

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
care of the center and that's why I have

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.920 
care of the center and that's why I have
this<00:02:48.769> original<00:02:49.769> layer<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.519> top<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.540> untied

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
this original layer up top so you untied

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.580 
this original layer up top so you untied
that<00:02:52.170> one

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
that one

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.580 
that one
you<00:02:53.190> take<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.640> eraser<00:02:54.090> tool<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.470> just

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
you take your eraser tool and you just

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.370 
you take your eraser tool and you just
go<00:02:55.739> around<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> edges<00:02:57.049> getting<00:02:58.049> rid<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
go around the edges getting rid of the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.589 
go around the edges getting rid of the
edge<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.910> actually<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.299> probably<00:03:00.390> a

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
edge and it's actually it probably a

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.400 
edge and it's actually it probably a
little<00:03:00.690> bit<00:03:00.950> too<00:03:01.950> much<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
little bit too much don't do that you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.839 
little bit too much don't do that you
only<00:03:04.440> want<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.860> take<00:03:05.040> enough<00:03:05.370> away<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:05.640> that

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
only want to take enough away so that

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.059 
only want to take enough away so that
the<00:03:06.030> edge<00:03:06.180> blends<00:03:06.630> out<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.799> go<00:03:10.920> all

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the edge blends out so you just go all

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:29.040 
the edge blends out so you just go all
the<00:03:11.099> way<00:03:11.160> around<00:03:11.459> your<00:03:11.549> edges

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.320 

there<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.660> now<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:31.960> is<00:03:32.400> blocking<00:03:33.400> out<00:03:33.820> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
there so now this is blocking out the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.140 
there so now this is blocking out the
the<00:03:35.050> seams<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> center<00:03:37.200> okay

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
the seams in the center okay

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.530 
the seams in the center okay
so<00:03:40.150> at<00:03:40.210> this<00:03:40.270> point<00:03:40.450> we<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.810> merge<00:03:40.960> our<00:03:41.170> layers

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
so at this point we can merge our layers

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.650 
so at this point we can merge our layers
and<00:03:43.540> if<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.500> had<00:03:44.800> any<00:03:45.370> lines<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:46.570> were

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
and if you had any lines that were

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.750 
and if you had any lines that were
visible<00:03:47.020> along<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.740> very<00:03:47.980> edge<00:03:48.160> that<00:03:48.700> you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
visible along the very edge that you

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.670 
visible along the very edge that you
don't<00:03:48.910> want<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:50.020> take<00:03:50.260> your<00:03:50.350> palette

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
don't want you just take your palette

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.000 
don't want you just take your palette
knife<00:03:51.390> set<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.600> small<00:03:52.960> number<00:03:53.200> pressure

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
knife set it to a small number pressure

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.100 
knife set it to a small number pressure
stick<00:03:54.850> right<00:03:55.060> here<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.300> have<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.540> line<00:03:55.840> that's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
stick right here I have a line that's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.810 
stick right here I have a line that's
kind<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.890> visible<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.460> I'm<00:03:57.520> just<00:03:57.640> going<00:03:57.760> to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
kind of visible so I'm just going to

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.630 
kind of visible so I'm just going to
blend<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.300> little<00:03:58.840> bit<00:03:59.400> okay<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.580> you

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
blend that a little bit okay but you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.550 
blend that a little bit okay but you
don't<00:04:00.760> want<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.060> work<00:04:01.240> too<00:04:01.510> close<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.410> edge

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
don't want to work too close to the edge

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.100 
don't want to work too close to the edge
otherwise<00:04:03.040> you'll<00:04:03.820> ruin<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.150> effect<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.750> on

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
otherwise you'll ruin the effect on on

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.400 
otherwise you'll ruin the effect on on
the<00:04:05.320> tiling<00:04:06.690> all<00:04:07.690> right<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.020> at<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.200> point

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
the tiling all right so at this point

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.410 
the tiling all right so at this point
we're<00:04:08.650> pretty<00:04:08.890> much<00:04:09.010> done<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:09.940> go<00:04:10.360> to

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
we're pretty much done you just go to

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.860 
we're pretty much done you just go to
file<00:04:10.750> export<00:04:11.710> his<00:04:12.160> image<00:04:12.600> name<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.720> what<00:04:13.840> you

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
file export his image name it what you

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.160 
file export his image name it what you
want<00:04:14.170> I'm<00:04:14.680> gonna<00:04:14.830> call<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.190> cloth<00:04:15.940> texture<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
want I'm gonna call it cloth texture and

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.200 
want I'm gonna call it cloth texture and
now<00:04:23.170> you<00:04:23.230> can<00:04:23.470> create<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> new<00:04:24.010> painting<00:04:24.490> using

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
now you can create a new painting using

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.280 
now you can create a new painting using
it<00:04:25.540> your<00:04:25.780> new<00:04:25.930> grain<00:04:28.410> use<00:04:29.410> our<00:04:29.590> window<00:04:29.860> size

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
it your new grain use our window size

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:43.360 
it your new grain use our window size
load<00:04:32.290> our<00:04:32.500> grain<00:04:32.800> in

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.790 

there<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.199> can<00:04:45.350> see<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.710> little

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
there is and so you can see it a little

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.090 
there is and so you can see it a little
better<00:04:46.010> I'll<00:04:47.020> paint<00:04:48.020> though<00:04:48.199> over<00:04:48.440> using<00:04:48.889> some

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
better I'll paint though over using some

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.740 
better I'll paint though over using some
kind<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.340> color<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:54.410> can<00:04:54.560> see<00:04:54.710> how<00:04:54.830> it's

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
kind of color you can see how it's

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.879 
kind of color you can see how it's
completely<00:04:57.639> without<00:04:58.639> any<00:04:58.699> lines<00:04:59.740> it's<00:05:00.740> all

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
completely without any lines it's all

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:13.279 
completely without any lines it's all
seamless

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.289 

although
