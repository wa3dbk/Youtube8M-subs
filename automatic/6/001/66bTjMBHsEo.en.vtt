00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.029 
hello my name is nice ankl Ayers I'm a
board-certified<00:00:12.830> dermatologist<00:00:13.830> with

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
board-certified dermatologist with

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.999 
board-certified dermatologist with
practice<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.670> our<00:00:14.789> wine<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.240> today<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.349> have<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:17.009 
practice in our wine and today we have a

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.830 
practice in our wine and today we have a
very<00:00:17.220> nice<00:00:17.430> vision<00:00:17.759> of<00:00:17.970> ours<00:00:18.300> who's<00:00:18.509> been<00:00:18.689> with

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
very nice vision of ours who's been with

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.839 
very nice vision of ours who's been with
us<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.169> many<00:00:19.200> years<00:00:19.439> we've<00:00:20.070> previously<00:00:20.369> done

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
us for many years we've previously done

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.269 
us for many years we've previously done
some<00:00:21.119> filling<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.990> her<00:00:22.169> however<00:00:22.740> she<00:00:23.099> does

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
some filling for her however she does

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.310 
some filling for her however she does
get<00:00:23.520> some<00:00:23.790> bruising<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.599> today<00:00:24.989> we<00:00:25.169> would

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
get some bruising and today we would

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.040 
get some bruising and today we would
like<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.970> show<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> technique<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.899> can

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
like to show a technique where you can

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.769 
like to show a technique where you can
do<00:00:28.200> these<00:00:28.349> fillers<00:00:28.739> using<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.250> cannula<00:00:29.759> and<00:00:30.239> in

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
do these fillers using a cannula and in

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
do these fillers using a cannula and in
this<00:00:30.930> way<00:00:31.140> we'll<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.559> the<00:00:31.680> filling<00:00:31.980> however

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this way we'll do the filling however

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
this way we'll do the filling however
we'll<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.809> no<00:00:34.020> bruising<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
we'll see no bruising because the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.700 
we'll see no bruising because the
cannula<00:00:35.540> essentially<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> needle<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.649> has

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
cannula essentially is a needle that has

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
cannula essentially is a needle that has
a<00:00:37.860> blunt<00:00:38.309> tip

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.299 

so<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:46.629> have<00:00:46.719> outlined<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.440> areas<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.129> would

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
so we have outlined the areas that would

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.430 
so we have outlined the areas that would
like<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:48.820> fill<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.660> at<00:00:49.870> this<00:00:49.989> time<00:00:50.199> we've

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
like to fill and at this time we've

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.250 
like to fill and at this time we've
chose<00:00:50.769> a<00:00:51.010> point<00:00:51.370> in<00:00:51.640> here<00:00:51.879> that<00:00:52.719> will<00:00:52.899> go<00:00:53.199> ahead

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
chose a point in here that will go ahead

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:03.299 
chose a point in here that will go ahead
and<00:00:53.680> numb<00:00:53.949> using<00:00:54.640> some<00:00:54.969> lidocaine<00:00:55.239> 1%<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
and numb using some lidocaine 1% and

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.910 
and numb using some lidocaine 1% and
this<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.729> 22<00:01:04.269> gauge<00:01:04.300> needle<00:01:04.869> or<00:01:05.440> we'll<00:01:05.680> just

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
this is a 22 gauge needle or we'll just

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.090 
this is a 22 gauge needle or we'll just
put<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.130> little<00:01:06.509> opening<00:01:07.509> in<00:01:07.690> this<00:01:08.680> area<00:01:09.070> that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
put a little opening in this area that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.940 
put a little opening in this area that
we<00:01:09.280> numbed<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:14.470> will<00:01:14.680> give<00:01:14.799> us<00:01:14.890> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
we numbed so this will give us the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.310 
we numbed so this will give us the
opening<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:16.920> put<00:01:17.920> in<00:01:18.130> our<00:01:18.280> cannula<00:01:21.179> so<00:01:22.179> this<00:01:23.080> is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
opening to put in our cannula so this is

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.290 
opening to put in our cannula so this is
the<00:01:23.470> cannula<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.280> can<00:01:24.429> see<00:01:24.610> it's<00:01:25.240> just

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
the cannula as you can see it's just

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.200 
the cannula as you can see it's just
like<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> needle<00:01:25.929> but<00:01:26.110> there<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.679> tip<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.970> is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
like a needle but there the tip of it is

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.770 
like a needle but there the tip of it is
not<00:01:28.479> sharp<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:30.009> hole<00:01:30.640> on<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.030> cannula<00:01:31.509> is<00:01:31.569> on

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
not sharp the hole on the cannula is on

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
not sharp the hole on the cannula is on
the<00:01:31.929> side

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.460 

so<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> cannula<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.630> advanced<00:01:40.260> is<00:01:41.119> any<00:01:42.119> pain

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
so that cannula is advanced is any pain

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.469 
so that cannula is advanced is any pain
there's<00:01:43.470> absolutely<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.190> pain<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> once<00:01:44.760> we

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
there's absolutely no pain and once we

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
there's absolutely no pain and once we
reach<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.810> area<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.260> we<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
reach the area that we would like to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.660 
reach the area that we would like to
fill<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.330> actually<00:01:48.950> palpate<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.430> see

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
fill we can actually palpate and see

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
fill we can actually palpate and see
where<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> tip<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> cannula<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
where the tip of the cannula is and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.180 
where the tip of the cannula is and
we'll<00:01:52.650> just<00:01:52.950> inject<00:01:53.400> and<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:55.190> the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
we'll just inject and in this way the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:06.760 
we'll just inject and in this way the
pain<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.729> very<00:01:56.970> minimal

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.889 

so<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.670> cannula<00:02:08.119> can<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.390> advanced<00:02:08.840> in

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
so the cannula can be advanced in

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:28.650 
so the cannula can be advanced in
different<00:02:09.319> directions

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.390 

did<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.320> feel<00:02:29.500> anything<00:02:29.710> at<00:02:29.890> all<00:02:29.980> nothing<00:02:32.400> so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
did you feel anything at all nothing so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.060 
did you feel anything at all nothing so
the<00:02:33.640> cannulas<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.420> used<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:35.070> different

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
the cannulas can be used in different

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.390 
the cannulas can be used in different
areas<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.550> face<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.570> 27<00:02:38.320> gauge<00:02:38.530> one

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
areas of the face this is a 27 gauge one

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.910 
areas of the face this is a 27 gauge one
and<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.610> half<00:02:40.240> inch<00:02:40.570> cannula<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:41.770> use

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
and a half inch cannula that we use

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.970 
and a half inch cannula that we use
primarily<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.990> very<00:02:43.990> rural<00:02:44.140> area<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.710> can

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
primarily in the very rural area you can

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.070 
primarily in the very rural area you can
instant<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.340> nasolabial<00:02:45.640> fold<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.750> do<00:02:46.870> have

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
instant the nasolabial fold we do have

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.320 
instant the nasolabial fold we do have
30<00:02:47.320> gauge<00:02:47.620> cannulas<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.520> we<00:02:48.670> use<00:02:48.880> under<00:02:49.210> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
30 gauge cannulas that we use under the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.110 
30 gauge cannulas that we use under the
eye<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:50.620> actually<00:02:51.100> fill<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.940> whole

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
eye and we can actually fill the whole

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.330 
eye and we can actually fill the whole
area<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> eye<00:02:52.690> we<00:02:53.530> also<00:02:53.710> use<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
area of the eye we also use it in the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.400 
area of the eye we also use it in the
temporal<00:02:54.760> area<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:58.140> marionette<00:02:59.140> lines

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
temporal area in the marionette lines

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.790 
temporal area in the marionette lines
you<00:03:00.280> know<00:03:00.400> anywhere<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.600> face<00:03:02.020> cannulas

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
you know anywhere on the face cannulas
