00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
it's working next test will be to

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.930 
it's working next test will be to
actually<00:01:31.320> test<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> air<00:01:32.070> brake<00:01:32.340> itself<00:01:32.760> but

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
actually test the air brake itself but

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.770 
actually test the air brake itself but
you<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:33.930> stuff<00:01:34.380> yet

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you don't I don't have that stuff yet

but the carls not equipped with air

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
but the carls not equipped with air
brake<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.380> testing<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
brake right now but I'm just testing the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.200 
brake right now but I'm just testing the
track<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.820> tracking<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.190> question<00:01:44.190> up<00:01:44.340> over

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
track the tracking and question up over

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
track the tracking and question up over
the<00:01:45.300> years<00:01:45.510> I've<00:01:45.720> made<00:01:45.900> approximately<00:01:46.140> 40<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the years I've made approximately 40 of

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
the years I've made approximately 40 of
these<00:01:47.160> cars<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.120> I<00:01:48.690> probably<00:01:48.960> made<00:01:50.990> probably

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
these cars and I probably made probably

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.650 
these cars and I probably made probably
60<00:01:52.470> pair<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.830> trucks<00:01:53.210> over<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.300> years<00:01:54.480> I've

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
60 pair of trucks over the years I've

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.070 
60 pair of trucks over the years I've
never<00:01:54.750> had<00:01:54.960> any<00:01:55.110> complaints<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:56.570> just<00:01:57.570> did<00:01:58.050> a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
never had any complaints so I just did a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.630 
never had any complaints so I just did a
little<00:01:58.260> bit<00:01:58.440> of<00:01:58.470> improving<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.340> trucks

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
little bit of improving on these trucks

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.830 
little bit of improving on these trucks
a<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:02.070> bit<00:02:02.160> better<00:02:02.480> but<00:02:03.480> I'm<00:02:03.630> just

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a a little bit better but I'm just

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
a a little bit better but I'm just
basically<00:02:04.320> trying<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.730> brake<00:02:05.970> system<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
basically trying out the brake system to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.540 
basically trying out the brake system to
see<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.010> work<00:02:08.070> out<00:02:08.399> because

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
see if it's going to work out because

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.140 
see if it's going to work out because
that's<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.210> revolutionize<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
that's going to revolutionize the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.310 
that's going to revolutionize the
six-wheel<00:02:12.150> breaking<00:02:12.630> they<00:02:13.050> work<00:02:13.260> out<00:02:14.180> see<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
six-wheel breaking they work out see it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.640 
six-wheel breaking they work out see it
see<00:02:16.320> how<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.500> works<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:18.260> where<00:02:19.260> when<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.440> got

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
see how it works on the where when I got

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.330 
see how it works on the where when I got
mein<00:02:20.360> hai<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.690> hit<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.050> main<00:02:22.260> clout<00:02:22.500> these<00:02:23.130> guys

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
mein hai I hit the main clout these guys

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.180 
mein hai I hit the main clout these guys
are<00:02:23.550> up<00:02:23.670> here

see<00:02:34.500> how<00:02:34.590> we're<00:02:35.040> gonna<00:02:35.810> testing<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> out<00:02:37.020> with

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
see how we're gonna testing it out with

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.780 
see how we're gonna testing it out with
the<00:02:37.230> air<00:02:37.440> brakes<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:38.010> never<00:02:38.280> gonna<00:02:38.490> see<00:02:38.580> how<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the air brakes to never gonna see how it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.190 
the air brakes to never gonna see how it
works<00:02:38.940> with<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> vacuum<00:02:39.420> we're<00:02:39.840> goes<00:02:39.960> down<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
works with a vacuum we're goes down a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.120 
works with a vacuum we're goes down a
try<00:02:41.810> somebody's<00:02:42.810> car<00:02:43.050> somebody<00:02:43.710> set<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:44.010> with

try somebody's car somebody set up with

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:57.350 
try somebody's car somebody set up with
