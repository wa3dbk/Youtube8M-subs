00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.820
 and, um, beauty, I came back here with more 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.700
 a video and today I drew it for you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 the kers sheep lord's test has arrived 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.510
 two, I downloaded the motherboard in steam and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.289
 For who wants to try to play and there 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.960
 available there not only weighs a river and bit 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.910
 just go down there and deboni and like 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 You can see there, guys, the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 performance of the poison was good, right? 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.309
 as if this were something new, right? 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.930
 but he even surprised me, right? 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 I do not know if you remember but it was a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:56.039
 also got much worse or worse. 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.390
 much worse 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.439
 I found that the 2 is much lighter than the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 first né but not né the second is é 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.240
 lighter than the first one, of course. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.229
 no 60fps but it's more playable right now 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 and who has a better and better pc my 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.140
 Are you going to be able to play more good? 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.509
 he is not leaving that scene there fighting 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.750
 with goose 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.049
 there because it was a livelier scene or 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 to give a better example of how the game 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.850
 right wheel because I believe that in most 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.990
 part of the game is not going to have much scene 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.880
 so shake and such 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.009
 then it is if you have a better pc and it is 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.180
 will run what I'm seeing the image of 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.149
 Good, at least I think. 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.390
 and I did a benchmark on sheep kers 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.600
 so that's when I'll leave it in the description 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.140
 and the maximum and minimum average there for you 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.690
 see the address is good so that's it 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.750
 People, I hope I have helped out there. 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.500
 If you liked fasting like a favorite, and if 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.930
 possible to assist in the dissemination and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.930
 That's what I said and until the next video 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.770
 ae 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.770
 on behalf of the school 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.880
 mendonção justice 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.950
 violating the principle is the same 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.840
 persistent my blood on these like 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.840
 in July 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.750
 ae 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.569
 it was much worse
