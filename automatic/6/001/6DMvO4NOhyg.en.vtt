00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.030
 Cool people until then cool is cool 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.740
 coal off 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.460

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.140
 Please do not be silly because it was 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 Nothing 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.880
 you forget it, you can snow locally 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.470
 15 minutes 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.300
 You never believe me why I expect 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.640
 that you are punctual until the morning, loud 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.640

 [Music] 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.830
 Ok, let's start with 20 lanes now 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.050
 Actually, I'll go in first 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.910
 some stretching exercises and then I let myself 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.210
 drift with her and so swim seven 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.100
 or eight the times were over 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.100
 [Music] 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.360
 the stopwatch is running now 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.500
 [Music] 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 [Applause] 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.650
 instead of just fixing on profit 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.660
 Maybe you just have to try 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.700
 to feel good 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.380
 sounds really good so you know 10 terms 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.450
 Now we speak the same language 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.130
 nice and you still swim a few 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.220

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.550

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.550

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.860
 everything is going well that's funny 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.650
 I like that you are so relaxed and relaxed 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.690
 you go so you do not win a trick 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.820
 if I'm to keep training you 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.460
 I have to touch you hard again 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.350
 Listen, you're my coach, I think 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.960
 You can win if you just do everything 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.360
 give 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.840
 [Music] 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.480

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.620
 Do you do that you are always reliable 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.540

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.640

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.930
 always until then 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.950
 that's a compliment and an insult 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.250
 is hard to say 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.250
 [Music] 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.730

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.250

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.640
 nobody can bother you anymore 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.640
 a bit closer 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.690
 [Music]
