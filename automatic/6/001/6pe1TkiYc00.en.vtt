00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
1st so it's very kind of compact

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.330 
1st so it's very kind of compact
efficient<00:02:16.780> left<00:02:17.020> hand<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.560> he's<00:02:17.680> employing

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
efficient left hand that he's employing

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.190 
efficient left hand that he's employing
here<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.830> his<00:02:21.790> opening<00:02:22.150> phrase<00:02:22.510> he

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
here and so in his opening phrase he

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.860 
here and so in his opening phrase he
begins<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.830> this

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.650 

so<00:02:33.870> what<00:02:34.140> he's<00:02:34.290> doing<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.920> he's<00:02:35.640> filling<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.360> on

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
so what he's doing is he's filling in on

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
so what he's doing is he's filling in on
the<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.320> three<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.800> end<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.280> four<00:02:38.610> here

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the and of three in the end of four here

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.850 
the and of three in the end of four here
with<00:02:39.120> his<00:02:39.270> index<00:02:39.600> finger<00:02:40.020> on<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> open<00:02:40.650> third

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860

with his index finger on the open third
string<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.510> something<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.140> John

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
string and this is something that John

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.430 
string and this is something that John
had<00:02:43.920> loved<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:45.210> fill<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.170> third

string on the upbeats
and<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.570> generates<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.690> lot<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.900> rhythmic

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and it generates a lot of rhythmic

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.740 
and it generates a lot of rhythmic
impetus<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.490> know<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:53.880> gets<00:02:54.300> moving

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
impetus you know it just gets moving

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:10.470 
impetus you know it just gets moving
like<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> locomotive<00:02:58.190> now<00:02:59.190> he<00:02:59.250> gets<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.930> g7
