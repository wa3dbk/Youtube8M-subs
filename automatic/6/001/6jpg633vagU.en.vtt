00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.160
 Yang Zongwei - Light and Shadow 

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:08.340
 Lyrics: Yang Zongwei Composer: Yang Zongwei 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.291
 There are a lot of colorful dazzling lights in the night and night. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.531
 Wake up in the dark 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.071
 My thoughts are on this city gallery. 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.911
 Slowly sprouting slowly 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.251
 It is unclear whether it is true or imagined 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.301
 All glimpse 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.301
 One by one about you 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.621
 To forget 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.841
 I’m listening to my eyes, I thought I could 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.211
 Against the light, follow the illusion and gradually walk towards you 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.241
 It’s just how I work hard, but I still remember it. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:55.691
 I discovered that you are already in a dream, you can’t see it. 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.631
 There are a lot of colorful dazzling lights in the night and night. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:17.611
 Wake up in the dark and exchange matches with matches 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.041
 May not feel or have weight 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.991
 Let's wander around my heart in your heart. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.291
 Who said no difference 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.181
 The darkness of the sky is in the past 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.541
 Where will you still think about me in the future? 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.311
 I’m listening to my eyes, I thought I could 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.621
 Against the light, follow the illusion and gradually walk towards you 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.671
 It’s just how I work hard, but I still remember it. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:37.011
 I discovered that you are already in a dream, you can’t see it. 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.631
 There are a lot of colorful dazzling lights in the night and night. 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.331
 Wake up in the dark 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.961
 Illuminate the experience of the next life
