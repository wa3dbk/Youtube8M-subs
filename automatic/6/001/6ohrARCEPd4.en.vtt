basically<00:02:46.989> they<00:02:47.110> take<00:02:47.230> stopping<00:02:47.650> power<00:02:47.800> out

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
basically they take stopping power out

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.130 
basically they take stopping power out
of<00:02:48.160> here<00:02:48.310> that's<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.420> stuff<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.690> they<00:02:49.930> learn

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
of here that's the stuff that they learn

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990 
of here that's the stuff that they learn
like<00:02:50.650> why<00:02:50.950> don't<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.310> give<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.880> him

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
like why don't you just give it to him

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.860 
like why don't you just give it to him
in<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> game<00:02:52.330> because<00:02:52.570> that's<00:02:52.750> what

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
in the game because that's what

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.770 
in the game because that's what
everybody<00:02:53.110> was<00:02:53.440> using<00:02:53.620> anyway<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.700> let<00:02:55.600> them

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
everybody was using anyway and let them

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
everybody was using anyway and let them
use<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.380> other<00:02:56.530> streaks<00:02:57.120> let<00:02:58.120> him<00:02:58.270> use<00:02:58.510> them

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
use the other streaks let him use them

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.210 
use the other streaks let him use them
so<00:03:00.400> I'm<00:03:00.610> sure<00:03:00.940> they're<00:03:01.239> working<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.260> will

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
so I'm sure they're working on what will

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.990 
so I'm sure they're working on what will
people<00:03:03.520> use<00:03:04.470> primarily<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.130> slot<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.430> spot

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
people use primarily in the slot to spot

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.210 
people use primarily in the slot to spot
so<00:03:07.810> now<00:03:07.989> you're<00:03:08.170> getting<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> two-for-one

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
so now you're getting like a two-for-one

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.330 
so now you're getting like a two-for-one
and<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:11.620> why<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.010> say<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.770> call<00:03:15.100> duty

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
and that's why I say that this call duty

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.130 
and that's why I say that this call duty
will<00:03:15.550> be<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.850> fastest<00:03:16.360> Call<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.630> Duty<00:03:16.959> game

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
will be the fastest Call of Duty game

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.470 
will be the fastest Call of Duty game
that<00:03:17.350> you've<00:03:17.500> ever<00:03:17.709> played<00:03:18.299> because<00:03:19.299> they've

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
that you've ever played because they've

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.970 
that you've ever played because they've
already<00:03:19.630> built<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.200> them<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.620> killing

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
already built in them the killing

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.860 
already built in them the killing
stopping<00:03:21.670> power<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:24.670> know<00:03:24.870> obviously

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
stopping power so now you know obviously

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.870 
stopping power so now you know obviously
they<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.470> mistakes<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.160> black<00:03:27.459> ops<00:03:27.700> is

the streaks literally you have to draw a
line<00:04:11.680> through<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.489> mini-map<00:04:12.880> when<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.750> drop

and I was thinking about

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.730 
and I was thinking about
what<00:04:27.190> he<00:04:27.520> was<00:04:27.670> saying<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.480> remembering<00:04:29.410> back

at Charlie got Delta Oscar and the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.320 
at Charlie got Delta Oscar and the
Infinity<00:04:32.770> Warren<00:04:33.040> forms<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:34.120> they<00:04:34.270> were

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
Infinity Warren forms what they were

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.570 
Infinity Warren forms what they were
talking<00:04:34.630> about<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.740> reason<00:04:35.890> why<00:04:36.190> modern

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
talking about and the reason why modern

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.610 
talking about and the reason why modern
warfare<00:04:36.820> 2<00:04:37.000> spawned<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.990> way<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.170> was<00:04:38.350> it<00:04:38.530> was

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
warfare 2 spawned the way it was it was

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.590 
warfare 2 spawned the way it was it was
kind<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:38.920> like<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.100> fan<00:04:39.520> appreciation<00:04:39.790> game

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
kind of like a fan appreciation game

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.080 
kind of like a fan appreciation game
that<00:04:41.140> basically<00:04:41.320> it<00:04:41.980> wasn't<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.640> majority<00:04:43.060> of

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
that basically it wasn't the majority of

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.330 
that basically it wasn't the majority of
their<00:04:43.330> ideas<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:44.290> was<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.890> with<00:04:45.010> everybody

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
their ideas it was it with everybody

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.700 
their ideas it was it with everybody
else's<00:04:45.880> idea<00:04:46.390> ideas<00:04:47.080> that<00:04:47.260> they<00:04:47.350> put<00:04:47.590> in<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
else's idea ideas that they put in the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.650 
else's idea ideas that they put in the
forms<00:04:48.100> but<00:04:48.730> I<00:04:48.760> don't<00:04:48.970> think<00:04:49.090> they<00:04:49.240> listened<00:04:49.600> to

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
forms but I don't think they listened to

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.750 
forms but I don't think they listened to
people<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:49.960> time<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:50.440> think<00:04:50.980> called<00:04:51.250> duty<00:04:51.490> for

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
people this time I think called duty for

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.200 
people this time I think called duty for
is<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:53.050> same<00:04:53.470> or<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:53.920> call<00:04:54.280> duty<00:04:54.460> for<00:04:54.730> part<00:04:55.000> to

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
is the same or of call duty for part to

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.000 
is the same or of call duty for part to
modern<00:04:55.690> warfare<00:04:55.810> 3<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.950> same<00:04:57.220> exact<00:04:59.010> idea

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
modern warfare 3 is the same exact idea

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.660 
modern warfare 3 is the same exact idea
and<00:05:00.610> plan<00:05:00.790> they<00:05:02.250> implemented<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.400> called

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
and plan they implemented and I called

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.180 
and plan they implemented and I called
it<00:05:03.820> for<00:05:04.180> just<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.930> bunch<00:05:05.140> of<00:05:05.230> guys<00:05:05.380> who<00:05:06.040> had

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
it for just a bunch of guys who had

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.040 
it for just a bunch of guys who had
great<00:05:06.400> ideas<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.120> then<00:05:07.540> they<00:05:07.660> came<00:05:07.810> up<00:05:07.870> with

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
great ideas and then they came up with

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.670 
great ideas and then they came up with
the<00:05:08.950> game<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:10.540> I<00:05:10.660> think<00:05:11.140> it's<00:05:11.230> like<00:05:11.380> paying

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
the game and I think it's like paying

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.970 
the game and I think it's like paying
homage<00:05:11.920> to<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:13.000> creator's<00:05:13.750> Zampella<00:05:14.500> West

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
homage to the creator's Zampella West

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.370 
homage to the creator's Zampella West
and<00:05:15.880> it's<00:05:16.030> like<00:05:16.300> yo<00:05:16.540> man<00:05:16.780> we<00:05:16.990> didn't<00:05:17.200> forget

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
and it's like yo man we didn't forget

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.190 
and it's like yo man we didn't forget
