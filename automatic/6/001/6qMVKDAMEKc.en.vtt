00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.699 
it's a cat and we were told that this is
the<00:02:48.830> first<00:02:49.099> game<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.730> history<00:02:50.620> where<00:02:51.620> they

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the first game in history where they

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.100 
the first game in history where they
mocap<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.370> cat<00:02:52.610> they<00:02:53.360> covered<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.750> cat<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
dots and they know captain I don't know

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.280 
dots and they know captain I don't know
what<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.360> make<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.780> didn't<00:02:57.019> get<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.200> see

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
what to make of that I didn't get to see

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.539 
what to make of that I didn't get to see
that<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.530> action<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:58.069> saw<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.190> photo<00:02:58.459> of

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
that in action I just saw a photo of

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.949 
that in action I just saw a photo of
them<00:02:58.790> putting<00:02:58.970> ping<00:02:59.180> pong<00:02:59.329> balls<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.750> cat

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
them putting ping pong balls on a cat

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.500 
them putting ping pong balls on a cat
what<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:00.799> did<00:03:00.980> see<00:03:01.160> was<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> prototype<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
what I did see was a prototype of the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.449 
what I did see was a prototype of the
combat<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.170> was<00:03:03.349> apparently<00:03:04.040> developed<00:03:04.220> in

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
combat that was apparently developed in

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.330 
combat that was apparently developed in
2013<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.390> not<00:03:05.930> final<00:03:06.769> product<00:03:07.130> at<00:03:07.220> all

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
2013 so it's not final product at all

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.190 
2013 so it's not final product at all
which<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.760> kind<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.599> hard<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.780> tell<00:03:08.870> what's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
which is kind of hard to tell what's

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.449 
which is kind of hard to tell what's
going<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.410> be<00:03:09.470> around<00:03:09.680> what's<00:03:09.980> what's<00:03:10.280> going

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
going to be around what's what's going

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.000 
going to be around what's what's going
to<00:03:10.519> kind<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.790> get<00:03:11.390> changed<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.650> game<00:03:12.769> has<00:03:12.980> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
to kind of get changed the game has a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.220 
to kind of get changed the game has a
very<00:03:13.340> high<00:03:13.790> saturation<00:03:14.390> high<00:03:14.720> contrast

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
very high saturation high contrast

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.349 
very high saturation high contrast
aesthetic<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.799> there's<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.880> lots<00:03:17.209> of

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
aesthetic like there's a just lots of

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.789 
aesthetic like there's a just lots of
bright<00:03:17.540> colors<00:03:17.600> but<00:03:18.139> then<00:03:18.290> lots<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.650> really

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
bright colors but then lots of really

bright colors but then lots of really
dark<00:03:19.069> shadows<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.579> there's<00:03:19.760> parts<00:03:19.940> were

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
dark shadows and there's parts were

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.460 
dark shadows and there's parts were

there were they were indoors and it was
kind<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.680> hard<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:21.920> was<00:03:21.980> tell<00:03:22.430> was<00:03:22.549> going<00:03:22.730> on<00:03:22.819> I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
kind of hard it was tell was going on I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.569 
kind of hard it was tell was going on I
wasn't<00:03:23.959> really<00:03:24.049> crazy<00:03:24.319> about<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:25.430> same

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
wasn't really crazy about that the same

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.370 
wasn't really crazy about that the same
kind<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.850> crazy<00:03:26.060> weapons<00:03:26.450> are<00:03:26.720> back<00:03:27.109> you<00:03:27.260> get

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
kind of crazy weapons are back you get

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
pitchfork you get weed whackers with

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.580 
pitchfork you get weed whackers with
blades<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.180> end<00:03:32.299> of<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:32.480> that's<00:03:33.290> that's<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
blades on the end of it that's that's a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.500 
blades on the end of it that's that's a
new<00:03:33.709> element<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.160> motorized<00:03:34.700> weapons<00:03:35.060> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
new element is motorized weapons the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.550 
new element is motorized weapons the
last<00:03:35.660> one<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:35.870> know<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.109> had<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:36.440> an

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
electrified machete in this case they're

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.509 
electrified machete in this case they're
still<00:03:38.930> crafting<00:03:39.319> and<00:03:39.440> everything<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.250> now

still crafting and everything but now

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.250 
still crafting and everything but now
it's<00:03:40.700> going<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:40.880> be<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.510> can<00:03:42.079> have<00:03:42.230> a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
it's going to be like you can have a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.770 
it's going to be like you can have a
chainsaw<00:03:42.739> that's<00:03:43.220> got<00:03:43.760> fire<00:03:44.209> on<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.660> or

chainsaw that's got fire on it or

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.569 
chainsaw that's got fire on it or
something<00:03:45.019> something<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.829> that<00:03:46.010> we<00:03:46.370> got<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
something something like that we got to

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.770 
something something like that we got to
see<00:03:46.639> a<00:03:46.670> crossbow<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.239> action<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.660> had

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
see a crossbow in action that had

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.569 
see a crossbow in action that had
flaming<00:03:48.290> bolts<00:03:48.560> as<00:03:48.920> opposed<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.250> having<00:03:49.400> like

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
flaming bolts as opposed to having like

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.770 
flaming bolts as opposed to having like
a<00:03:49.609> thing<00:03:49.790> we<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.209> know<00:03:50.239> light<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.630> ball

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
a thing we just you know light the ball

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.059 
a thing we just you know light the ball
before<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.139> shoot<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.410> there<00:03:51.739> was<00:03:51.859> just<00:03:52.010> a

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
before you shoot it there was just a

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.680 
before you shoot it there was just a
nice<00:03:52.220> little<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:53.000> know<00:03:53.090> butane<00:03:53.420> torch

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
nice little you know butane torch

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.449 
nice little you know butane torch
mounted<00:03:54.109> on<00:03:54.200> top<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.650> every<00:03:55.040> time<00:03:55.190> we<00:03:55.250> fired

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
mounted on top of it every time we fired

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.099 
mounted on top of it every time we fired
a<00:03:55.549> bolt<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.940> would<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.329> guess<00:03:56.510> light<00:03:56.810> as<00:03:56.989> it

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
a bolt it would just I guess light as it

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.960 
a bolt it would just I guess light as it
went<00:03:57.260> out<00:03:57.349> one<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.489> big<00:03:58.579> problems<00:03:58.609> with

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
went out one of the big problems with

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.339 
went out one of the big problems with
dead<00:03:59.090> island<00:03:59.359> one<00:03:59.480> was<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.780> course<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.139> fact

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
dead island one was of course the fact

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.020 
dead island one was of course the fact
that<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.650> shoot<00:04:00.920> zombies<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.549> guns<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.910> it

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
that you shoot zombies of guns and it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.819 
that you shoot zombies of guns and it
wouldn't<00:04:02.420> really<00:04:02.569> do<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.139> whole<00:04:03.230> lot<00:04:03.410> they<00:04:03.769> were

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
wouldn't really do a whole lot they were

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.440 
wouldn't really do a whole lot they were
kind<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> weakest<00:04:04.849> weapon<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.299> game

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
kind of the weakest weapon in the game

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.330 
kind of the weakest weapon in the game
as<00:04:05.630> opposed<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.959> Orr's<00:04:06.139> from<00:04:06.709> boats<00:04:07.010> which

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
as opposed to Orr's from boats which

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.039 
as opposed to Orr's from boats which
were<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.579> guess<00:04:07.880> perfectly<00:04:08.510> acceptable

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049
