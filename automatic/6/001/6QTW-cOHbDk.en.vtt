a<00:01:23.520> 55<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> 20<00:01:24.450> base<00:01:24.630> damage<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> modern<00:01:25.530> warfare

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
a 55 to 20 base damage in modern warfare

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.469 
a 55 to 20 base damage in modern warfare
3<00:01:25.829> but<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.460> expecting<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.210> somewhere

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
3 but I'm expecting that to be somewhere

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.959 
3 but I'm expecting that to be somewhere
around<00:01:27.600> 45<00:01:28.109> to<00:01:28.319> 20<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.219> reload<00:01:29.520> times<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.819> made

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
around 45 to 20 the reload times we made

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.819 
around 45 to 20 the reload times we made
roughly<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> same<00:01:30.569> at<00:01:30.689> about<00:01:30.869> 2.8<00:01:31.350> seconds

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
roughly the same at about 2.8 seconds

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.739 
roughly the same at about 2.8 seconds
the<00:01:32.130> magazine<00:01:32.549> size<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> always<00:01:33.060> standard<00:01:33.539> on

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
the magazine size is always standard on

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.330 
the magazine size is always standard on
these<00:01:33.990> weapons<00:01:34.319> at<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.590> 30<00:01:34.859> rounds<00:01:35.219> which

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
these weapons at about 30 rounds which

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.459 
these weapons at about 30 rounds which
is<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> box<00:01:35.819> magazine<00:01:36.359> and<00:01:36.569> the<00:01:36.990> fire<00:01:37.229> rate<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
is a box magazine and the fire rate is

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.690 
is a box magazine and the fire rate is
kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.859> interesting<00:01:38.249> because<00:01:38.310> there's<00:01:38.549> two

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
kind of interesting because there's two

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.730 
kind of interesting because there's two
versions<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.539> actual<00:01:39.960> weapon<00:01:40.289> now<00:01:40.679> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
versions of this actual weapon now the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.190 
versions of this actual weapon now the
650<00:01:41.579> rounds<00:01:41.759> per<00:01:42.060> minute<00:01:42.179> weapon<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
650 rounds per minute weapon is just the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800 
650 rounds per minute weapon is just the
standard<00:01:43.409> qbz<00:01:44.130> 95<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> look<00:01:45.659> at

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
standard qbz 95 but if we take a look at

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.779 
standard qbz 95 but if we take a look at
the<00:01:45.929> 800<00:01:46.469> rounds<00:01:46.740> per<00:01:46.770> minute<00:01:46.950> version<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
the 800 rounds per minute version that

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.449 
the 800 rounds per minute version that
is<00:01:47.909> basically<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.450> qbz<00:01:49.020> 95<00:01:49.409> carbine<00:01:50.009> version

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
is basically the qbz 95 carbine version

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:51.499 
is basically the qbz 95 carbine version
that<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.639> can<00:01:50.670> pretty<00:01:50.909> much<00:01:50.969> find<00:01:51.270> in

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that you can pretty much find in

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.669 
that you can pretty much find in
battlefield<00:01:52.109> so<00:01:52.319> it's<00:01:52.409> gonna<00:01:52.499> be<00:01:52.619> very

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
battlefield so it's gonna be very

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.319 
battlefield so it's gonna be very
interesting<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.429> see<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.700> weapon<00:01:54.240> they

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
interesting to see what weapon they

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
interesting to see what weapon they
actually<00:01:54.659> bring<00:01:54.869> into<00:01:55.139> this<00:01:55.259> game<00:01:55.469> now<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.459> we

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
actually bring into this game now if we

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.879 
actually bring into this game now if we
compare<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.939> sets<00:01:57.179> of<00:01:57.359> our<00:01:57.479> future<00:01:57.780> qbz<00:01:58.289> 95<00:01:58.709> to

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:58.889 
compare the sets of our future qbz 95 to

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.469 
compare the sets of our future qbz 95 to
our<00:01:59.039> current<00:01:59.340> too-tight<00:01:59.729> 95<00:02:00.090> you'll<00:02:00.240> first

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
our current too-tight 95 you'll first

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.910 
our current too-tight 95 you'll first
i've<00:02:00.600> noticed<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.139> base<00:02:01.319> damage<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
i've noticed that the base damage on the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
i've noticed that the base damage on the
type<00:02:02.100> 95<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.609> 55<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> 20<00:02:03.539> which<00:02:03.929> a<00:02:04.049> lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.289> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
type 95 is 55 to 20 which a lot of you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.959 
type 95 is 55 to 20 which a lot of you
subscribers<00:02:05.009> should<00:02:05.039> know<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:05.490> after<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
subscribers should know about after a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
subscribers should know about after a
lot<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.270> our<00:02:06.359> gun<00:02:06.539> breakdown<00:02:06.929> videos<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
lot of our gun breakdown videos the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.919 
lot of our gun breakdown videos the
reload<00:02:07.950> time<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.429> about<00:02:08.610> 2.7<00:02:09.149> seconds<00:02:09.630> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
reload time is at about 2.7 seconds the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.840 
reload time is at about 2.7 seconds the
magazine<00:02:10.350> size<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.740> at<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:11.100> 30<00:02:11.370> rounds<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
magazine size is at about 30 rounds and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.460 
magazine size is at about 30 rounds and
of<00:02:11.910> course<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.300> fire<00:02:12.600> rate<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.870> where<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> think

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of course the fire rate is where I think

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.869 
of course the fire rate is where I think
they<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.709> mess<00:02:13.920> up<00:02:14.069> at<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:14.760> they

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
they kind of mess up at because they

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.039 
they kind of mess up at because they
fire<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.299> this<00:02:15.420> weapon<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:15.780> at<00:02:15.870> around

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
fire it on this weapon is at around

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.380 
fire it on this weapon is at around
1,200<00:02:16.799> rounds<00:02:16.950> when<00:02:17.489> realistically<00:02:18.269> this

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
1,200 rounds when realistically this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.610 
1,200 rounds when realistically this
weapon<00:02:18.780> should<00:02:18.959> only<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.349> sure

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
weapon should only be sure

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800 
weapon should only be sure
at<00:02:19.799> around<00:02:19.950> 800<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.610> 850<00:02:21.239> rounds-per-minute

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
at around 800 to 850 rounds-per-minute

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.140 
at around 800 to 850 rounds-per-minute
so<00:02:22.650> essentially<00:02:23.190> from<00:02:23.370> close<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.790> medium

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
so essentially from close to medium

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.970 
so essentially from close to medium
range<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.720> only<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:25.049> take<00:02:25.230> one<00:02:25.530> burst

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
range it's only gonna take one burst

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.589 
range it's only gonna take one burst
from<00:02:26.159> any<00:02:26.400> part<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> body<00:02:26.909> to<00:02:27.299> kill<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
from any part of the body to kill the

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.100 
from any part of the body to kill the
enemy

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
enemy

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.839 
enemy
now<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.650> course<00:02:28.709> my<00:02:29.069> final<00:02:29.459> thoughts<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
now of course my final thoughts on the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.270 
now of course my final thoughts on the
qbz<00:02:30.390> 95<00:02:30.810> are<00:02:31.080> turning<00:02:31.349> in<00:02:31.440> black<00:02:31.650> ops<00:02:31.860> 2<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
qbz 95 are turning in black ops 2 I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.979 
qbz 95 are turning in black ops 2 I
honestly<00:02:32.849> don't<00:02:33.120> think<00:02:33.269> we<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.629> too<00:02:33.780> much<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
honestly don't think we have too much to

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.479 
honestly don't think we have too much to
worry<00:02:34.349> about<00:02:34.409> as<00:02:34.590> far<00:02:34.830> as<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.010> weapon<00:02:35.310> being

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
worry about as far as this weapon being

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.490 
worry about as far as this weapon being
overpowered<00:02:36.060> Treyarch<00:02:36.810> has<00:02:36.959> always<00:02:37.200> done<00:02:37.379> a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
overpowered Treyarch has always done a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.319 
overpowered Treyarch has always done a
really<00:02:37.769> really<00:02:38.129> great<00:02:38.340> job<00:02:38.370> making<00:02:39.060> sure<00:02:39.209> that

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
really really great job making sure that

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.670 
really really great job making sure that
all<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.659> weapons<00:02:39.959> are<00:02:40.049> balanced<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.590> if

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
all the weapons are balanced and if

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.930 
all the weapons are balanced and if
there's<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> weapon<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.549> does<00:02:41.700> stick

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
there's a weapon that really does stick

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.970 
there's a weapon that really does stick
out<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.540> also<00:02:42.750> do<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> great<00:02:43.260> job<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.620> patching

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
out they also do a great job in patching

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.710

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.430 
the weapon was pretty good it was kind
of<00:03:12.180> interesting<00:03:12.599> because<00:03:12.690> weapon<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:13.290> had<00:03:13.409> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
of interesting because weapon we had a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.559 
of interesting because weapon we had a
very<00:03:13.709> low<00:03:13.859> damage<00:03:14.159> but<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.879> fire<00:03:15.150> rate<00:03:15.359> was

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569
