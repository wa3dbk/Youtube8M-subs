00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.109 
a cup pull out the the cone I guess and
I<00:01:05.010> guess<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.610> something<00:01:05.970> pretty

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I guess you have something pretty

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
I guess you have something pretty
similar<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.720> without<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> caramel<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
similar to this without the caramel this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
similar to this without the caramel this
was<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> dollar<00:01:08.549> 40<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.330> 60<00:01:09.780> cents<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
was a dollar 40 and so 60 cents is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.469 
was a dollar 40 and so 60 cents is
literally<00:01:10.740> less<00:01:11.100> than<00:01:11.280> half<00:01:11.430> expensive<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
literally less than half expensive so

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.420 
literally less than half expensive so
