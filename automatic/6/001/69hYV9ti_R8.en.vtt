with the the pop bottle here I cut it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.649 
with the the pop bottle here I cut it
into<00:00:49.980> already<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> save<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.510> time

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
into already just to save little time

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.840 
into already just to save little time
but<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> want<00:00:52.769> to<00:00:52.800> cut<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.190> one-third

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
but you want to cut it about one-third

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.189 
but you want to cut it about one-third
of<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.030> way<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:54.960> inches

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of the way up it's about four inches

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
of the way up it's about four inches
from<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.500> bottom<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.460> part<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.790> be<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
from the bottom this part can be a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.399 
from the bottom this part can be a
little<00:00:57.030> bit<00:00:57.390> difficult<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.110> if<00:00:58.199> you're<00:00:58.320> doing

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
little bit difficult so if you're doing

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.719 
little bit difficult so if you're doing
this<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.739> children<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> might<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.610> the

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
this with children you might want the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.139 
this with children you might want the
adult<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.589> I<00:01:01.589> just<00:01:01.949> popped<00:01:02.159> a<00:01:02.339> hole<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
adult to do this I just popped a hole in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.430 
adult to do this I just popped a hole in
the<00:01:03.239> side<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> bottle<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.259> just

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
the side of the bottle and then I just

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.660 
the side of the bottle and then I just
cut<00:01:04.619> along<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.009> line<00:01:05.160> with<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.429> pair<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
cut along the line with a pair of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.969 
cut along the line with a pair of
scissors<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.410> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> start<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
scissors so we're going to start the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.499 
scissors so we're going to start the
terrarium<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.610> bottom<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.179> bottle

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
terrarium with the bottom of the bottle

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.050 
terrarium with the bottom of the bottle
we're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.500> add<00:01:10.619> about<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.130> inch<00:01:11.399> of<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
we're going to add about one inch of the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.419 
we're going to add about one inch of the
coarse<00:01:12.420> side<00:01:12.660> or<00:01:12.899> small<00:01:13.170> pebbles<00:01:13.649> here<00:01:14.250> I'm

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
coarse side or small pebbles here I'm

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.279 
coarse side or small pebbles here I'm
using<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.940> fishtank<00:01:15.450> rocks<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.050> work

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
using some fishtank rocks which work

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.050 
using some fishtank rocks which work
really<00:01:16.590> well<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.000> use

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
really well but you're going to use

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
really well but you're going to use
pretty<00:01:18.450> much<00:01:18.539> any<00:01:18.960> sort<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.410> sediment<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
pretty much any sort of sediment that is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.120 
pretty much any sort of sediment that is
going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> allow<00:01:20.910> drainage<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going to allow drainage and what this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
going to allow drainage and what this
inch<00:01:23.880> layer<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
inch layer is going to do is going to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
inch layer is going to do is going to
allow<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> excess<00:01:26.909> water<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
allow all of the excess water from the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
allow all of the excess water from the
terrarium<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:28.200> gather<00:01:28.440> here<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:29.009> mean<00:01:29.550> this<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
terrarium to gather here I mean this is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
terrarium to gather here I mean this is
going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> prevent<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.420> soil<00:01:31.050> from<00:01:31.259> getting

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
going to prevent the soil from getting

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600 
going to prevent the soil from getting
muddy<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.140> keeps<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.649> terrarium<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
muddy and just keeps the terrarium a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.420 
muddy and just keeps the terrarium a
little<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.030> healthier<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> next<00:01:41.070> step<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
little bit healthier so the next step is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
little bit healthier so the next step is
optional<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.299> find<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> helps<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.170> keep

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
optional but we find it helps to keep

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.280 
optional but we find it helps to keep
your<00:01:43.740> terrarium<00:01:44.369> nice<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> clean<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.020> I'm

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
going to add about 1/4 of an inch layer

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
going to add about 1/4 of an inch layer
of<00:01:48.420> activated<00:01:48.750> carbon<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.740> activated

next we're going to add the soil so here
I'm<00:02:19.769> using<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.370> potting<00:02:21.000> soil<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.620> shouldn't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I'm using a potting soil you shouldn't

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.310 
I'm using a potting soil you shouldn't
use<00:02:23.250> garden<00:02:23.970> soil<00:02:24.239> because<00:02:24.630> lots<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.989> garden

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
use garden soil because lots of garden

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.440 
use garden soil because lots of garden
soil<00:02:25.500> will<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:25.890> fun<00:02:26.190> G<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.549> bacteria<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.299> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
soil will have fun G and bacteria in it

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
soil will have fun G and bacteria in it
which<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.079> fine<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.470> your<00:02:28.590> garden<00:02:29.010> however<00:02:29.489> in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
which is fine in your garden however in

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.640 
which is fine in your garden however in
a<00:02:30.060> terrarium<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.019> be<00:02:31.079> very<00:02:31.260> moist

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
a terrarium it's going to be very moist

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.520 
a terrarium it's going to be very moist
and<00:02:32.040> very<00:02:32.160> warm<00:02:32.820> which<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.750> an<00:02:33.840> ideal<00:02:34.260> growth

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and very warm which is an ideal growth

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.800 
and very warm which is an ideal growth
condition<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> spongy<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.000> bacteria

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
condition for the spongy and bacteria

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.020 
condition for the spongy and bacteria
and<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.739> cause<00:02:38.010> some<00:02:38.250> problems<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.850> here

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and it can cause some problems so here

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.569 
and it can cause some problems so here
I'm<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.299> using<00:02:39.480> some<00:02:40.190> sterilized<00:02:41.190> potting

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
I'm just using some sterilized potting

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.550 
I'm just using some sterilized potting
soil<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:42.870> also<00:02:43.079> promotes

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
soil and that really also promotes

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.500 
soil and that really also promotes
growth<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.519> really<00:02:44.760> good<00:02:44.880> idea

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
growth so it's a really good idea

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.930 
growth so it's a really good idea
and<00:02:46.349> I'm<00:02:46.470> filling<00:02:46.709> up<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.489> rest<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.849> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and I'm filling up the the rest of the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
and I'm filling up the the rest of the
bottle<00:02:48.269> arm<00:02:48.540> almost<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.349> top<00:02:49.530> not<00:02:49.860> quite<00:02:50.129> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
bottle arm almost to the top not quite a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.220 
bottle arm almost to the top not quite a
little<00:02:50.879> bit<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.150> room<00:02:51.330> left<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.780> almost<00:02:51.989> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
little bit of room left but almost the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.800 
little bit of room left but almost the
top<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.819> then<00:02:53.909> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.239> Pat<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.480> down

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
top and then you can just Pat it down

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.199 
top and then you can just Pat it down
good<00:02:55.170> little<00:02:55.500> tap<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.430> get<00:02:56.549> any<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.970> large

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
good little tap to get any of the large

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.740 
good little tap to get any of the large
at<00:02:57.659> your<00:02:57.840> ear<00:02:58.349> pockets<00:02:58.860> out<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.069> there<00:02:59.220> and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
at your ear pockets out of there and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.369 
at your ear pockets out of there and
just<00:03:00.750> tap<00:03:00.930> down<00:03:01.200> again<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:04.019> soil<00:03:04.260> is

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
just tap down again so now my soil is

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.930 
just tap down again so now my soil is
actually<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> little<00:03:04.860> bit<00:03:05.040> dry<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.489> I'm<00:03:05.849> just

actually a little bit dry so I'm just
going<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.180> add<00:03:06.239> some<00:03:06.450> water<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
going to add some water and this is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.500 
going to add some water and this is
going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.099> help<00:03:08.250> while<00:03:08.519> I'm<00:03:08.640> planting<00:03:08.910> keep

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
the dust down you don't have to do this

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.680 
the dust down you don't have to do this
if<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.599> nice<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:13.200> soil

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.320 

so<00:03:19.320> now<00:03:19.470> I'm<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.770> add<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:19.950> plants<00:03:20.370> here

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330

I<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.840> first<00:03:22.680> laughing<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.550> some<00:03:24.060> moss<00:03:24.800> if

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
I have a first laughing and some moss if

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.110 
I have a first laughing and some moss if
you're<00:03:25.980> going<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.160> collect<00:03:26.400> your<00:03:26.550> own<00:03:26.580> plants

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
it's a really good idea to get them from

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.790 
it's a really good idea to get them from
the<00:03:29.670> same<00:03:29.850> area<00:03:30.410> because<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.650> can

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
the same area because then you can

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.960 
the same area because then you can
almost<00:03:31.920> guarantee<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.490> they<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:32.820> the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
almost guarantee you that they have the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.370 
almost guarantee you that they have the
sunlight<00:03:33.270> same<00:03:33.720> sunlight<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.410> water<00:03:35.180> needs

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
sunlight same sunlight and water needs

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.290 
sunlight same sunlight and water needs
or<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.710> just<00:03:37.830> plant<00:03:38.100> one<00:03:38.190> plant<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.000> add

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
or you can just plant one plant and add

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.870 
or you can just plant one plant and add
a<00:03:39.330> little<00:03:39.600> moss<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:40.110> there<00:03:40.260> um<00:03:40.580> it's<00:03:41.580> really

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
a little moss in there um it's really

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.880 
a little moss in there um it's really
just<00:03:42.210> up<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:43.230> not<00:03:43.470> rocket<00:03:43.710> science

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
just up to you it's not rocket science

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.160 
just up to you it's not rocket science
it<00:03:44.310> should<00:03:44.430> be<00:03:44.550> pretty<00:03:44.700> easy<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.750> something

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170

voice<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:08.070> don't<00:04:08.250> want<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.520> to<00:04:08.670> be<00:04:08.820> muddy<00:04:09.170> or

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
voice you don't want it to be muddy or

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.010 
voice you don't want it to be muddy or
soggy<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.330> just<00:04:12.450> check<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.840> either

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
soggy so you can just check this either

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.120 
soggy so you can just check this either
to<00:04:13.350> see<00:04:13.530> how<00:04:13.680> dry<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.160> all<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.240> way<00:04:15.330> through

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
to see how dry it is all the way through

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.979 
to see how dry it is all the way through
so<00:04:17.130> now<00:04:17.280> we're<00:04:17.519> going<00:04:17.670> to<00:04:17.820> put<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> top<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
so now we're going to put the top of the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.990 
so now we're going to put the top of the
bottle<00:04:19.320> on<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.489> can<00:04:20.580> be<00:04:20.640> pretty<00:04:20.850> difficult

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
bottle on but it can be pretty difficult

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.990 
bottle on but it can be pretty difficult
so<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.290> going<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.650> add<00:04:22.800> some<00:04:23.100> slits<00:04:23.640> I'm<00:04:23.880> going

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so I'm going to add some slits I'm going

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.210 
so I'm going to add some slits I'm going
to<00:04:24.060> add<00:04:24.150> four<00:04:24.480> along<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.110> along<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.010> side

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
to add four along the along the side

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.970 
to add four along the along the side
here<00:04:26.250> equally<00:04:26.880> spaced<00:04:27.240> out<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.900> that's<00:04:28.680> just

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
here equally spaced out and that's just

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.040 
here equally spaced out and that's just
going<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.160> help<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.610> bottle<00:04:30.360> top<00:04:30.540> go<00:04:30.840> on<00:04:31.020> a

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
going to help the the bottle top go on a

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.440 
going to help the the bottle top go on a
little<00:04:31.350> bit<00:04:31.470> easier<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:33.060> going<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.300> be<00:04:33.420> a

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
little bit easier it is going to be a

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.750 
little bit easier it is going to be a
pretty<00:04:33.900> snug<00:04:34.200> fit<00:04:34.470> though<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:38.100> have<00:04:38.460> little

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
pretty snug fit though so have little

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.730 
pretty snug fit though so have little
patience<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.510> eventually<00:04:40.290> it's<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:40.620> going

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
patience and eventually it's just going

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.820 
patience and eventually it's just going
to<00:04:40.830> go<00:04:40.919> on<00:04:41.100> there<00:04:41.510> then<00:04:42.510> your<00:04:42.870> terrarium<00:04:43.410> will

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
to go on there then your terrarium will

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.580 
to go on there then your terrarium will
be<00:04:43.950> complete<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> closed<00:04:46.290> system

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
be complete so this is a closed system

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.370 
be complete so this is a closed system
and<00:04:47.040> it's<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.820> really<00:04:48.000> great<00:04:48.240> learning<00:04:48.480> tool<00:04:48.690> to

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
and it's a really great learning tool to

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.560 
and it's a really great learning tool to
learn<00:04:49.919> about<00:04:50.070> ecosystems<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.330> water

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
learn about ecosystems and the water

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.990 
learn about ecosystems and the water
cycle<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.350> what's<00:04:53.160> going<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.340> happen<00:04:53.790> is

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
cycle and what's going to happen is

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.900 
cycle and what's going to happen is
during<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.930> day<00:04:55.110> your<00:04:55.860> terrarium<00:04:56.280> is<00:04:56.669> going

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
during the day your terrarium is going

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.730 
during the day your terrarium is going
to<00:04:57.030> heat<00:04:57.240> up<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:58.110> water<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.560> going<00:04:58.590> to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
to heat up and the water is going to

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.409 
to heat up and the water is going to
evaporate<00:04:58.830> from<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.610> plants<00:05:00.090> in<00:05:00.210> from<00:05:00.330> the

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
evaporate from the plants in from the

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.540 
evaporate from the plants in from the
soil<00:05:00.720> but<00:05:01.560> during<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.890> evening<00:05:02.220> it's<00:05:02.400> going

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
soil but during the evening it's going

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.100 
soil but during the evening it's going
to<00:05:02.610> cool<00:05:02.820> down<00:05:03.030> it's<00:05:03.240> going<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.419> condense<00:05:03.750> on

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
to cool down it's going to condense on

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.810 
to cool down it's going to condense on
the<00:05:04.380> sides<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.980> it's<00:05:05.130> going<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.310> rain<00:05:05.550> back

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
the sides and it's going to rain back

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.370 
the sides and it's going to rain back
down<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.270> water<00:05:06.450> your<00:05:06.630> plants<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.260> like<00:05:07.350> a

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
down to water your plants so it's like a

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.920 
down to water your plants so it's like a
little<00:05:07.560> mini<00:05:07.860> water<00:05:08.190> cycle<00:05:08.640> I<00:05:08.880> hope<00:05:09.750> you

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
little mini water cycle I hope you

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.330 
little mini water cycle I hope you
enjoyed<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.320> video<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.830> good<00:05:10.950> luck<00:05:11.010> with
