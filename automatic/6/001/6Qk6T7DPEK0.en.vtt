00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.879
 we are still in turkey very close to 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.059
 istanbul where we are now in 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.860
 q burgas a security guard called 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.529
 already the single man 'has come video 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.840
 actually recording objects and 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.040
 extraordinary monies never before 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.189
 seen since 2007 however 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.220
 among them stand out those of 2009 three 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:38.350
 extraordinary videos recorded on 13 the 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:42.130
 15 and May 17, 2009 and each one 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.030
 presents very different aspects that give 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.370
 a life give truth we are before the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.940
 change of times 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.230
 in 2009 and the single man ' returned to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.589
 record on May 13, 2009 could 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.290
 capture this ship that we had already seen 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.229
 previously with what seems to be the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.080
 silhouette of two of its occupants 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.369
 Salman has a powerful camera 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.330
 that amplifies it up to 200 times the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.840
 image which allows you to capture these 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.590
 objects at a certain distance and observe them 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 clearly see yourself as even 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.130
 can capture the smallest details 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 the colors and this fact so 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.259
 significant that there is a gate 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.070
 open and that the beings that are there 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:43.179
 seem to be poking that same day to 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.789
 the 357 in the morning letter to another 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.159
 This ship is bigger and in one 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.369
 different position than we have 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.030
 observed most of his images of 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.030
 your videos 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.010
 as we already know these ships are capable 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.830
 to produce and illuminate their own 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.260
 structure 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.490
 as if the metal or the material that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.460
 It constitutes 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.790
 will be electrified two days after 15 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.760
 May 2009, close to 5 in the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.220
 early morning captures a smaller ship 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.220
 now it has the gates closed 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.760
 half is visible and the other without 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.760
 However, that same day 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.580
 an hour later 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.620
 I would capture this extraordinary image 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.590
 it seems to be the same object that now 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.340
 illuminate the distance and see you a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.420
 witness a dog that will bark 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.640
 directly to that light which certifies 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.640
 that the object is in that place 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.280
 on May 17 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.050
 and would record what in my concept is the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.830
 most extraordinary image of all 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.650
 times since we can see not one but 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.080
 to several occupants and at least four 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 open floodgates of this ship 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.330
 does the first one is in its movement of 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.990
 close up 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.050
 does it again 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.970
 see you in the front they look 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:39.090
 two figures there is an open hatch 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.090
 in the central part a solitary figure 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.459
 now he makes a zumba move to 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.550
 approach the moon thus establishing a 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.970
 so important benchmark for 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.970
 give truth 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.830
 again he approaches the ship and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.760
 again we look at those details 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.730
 see the open floodgates 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.980
 the figures that show the size of 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.099
 this ship that must be more than 20 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.099
 meters
