00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.470 
and runs on Android 4.1.2 jelly bean now
let's<00:00:41.340> start<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> antutu<00:00:42.300> benchmark<00:00:44.360> we<00:00:45.360> have

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
let's start the antutu benchmark we have

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
let's start the antutu benchmark we have
fast<00:00:45.750> forward<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> benchmarks<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
fast forward all the benchmarks for you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
fast forward all the benchmarks for you
so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> final<00:00:48.090> results

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so that we can get the final results

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.170 
so that we can get the final results
quickly

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.840 

so<00:00:56.180> we've<00:00:56.270> got<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.420> final<00:00:56.690> score<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.960> 4<00:00:57.170> 3<00:00:57.200> 0<00:00:57.620> 1

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
so we've got a final score of 4 3 0 1

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.990 
so we've got a final score of 4 3 0 1

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
4 1 &amp; 2 output 6 2 6 which puts it

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.660 
4 1 &amp; 2 output 6 2 6 which puts it
somewhere<00:01:04.850> just<00:01:05.510> above<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.620> Galaxy<00:01:07.190> S<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
somewhere just above the Galaxy S the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.410 
somewhere just above the Galaxy S the
original<00:01:08.120> one<00:01:09.370> now<00:01:10.370> let's<00:01:10.610> run<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.940> quadrant

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
original one now let's run the quadrant

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:25.240 
original one now let's run the quadrant
benchmark<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:24.080> we<00:01:24.200> got<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.350> quadrant<00:01:24.770> score<00:01:25.100> of

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
benchmark so we got a quadrant score of

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.180 
benchmark so we got a quadrant score of
1535<00:01:26.180> which<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.290> OK<00:01:27.619> for<00:01:27.680> an<00:01:27.890> entry-level

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
1535 which is OK for an entry-level

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.370 
1535 which is OK for an entry-level
handset<00:01:34.330> now<00:01:35.330> we<00:01:35.390> are<00:01:35.540> going<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.720> run<00:01:35.840> enum<00:01:36.200> up

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
handset now we are going to run enum up

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.570 
handset now we are going to run enum up
to<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:38.390> test<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.960> graphics<00:01:39.440> ability<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:40.160> the

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
to this test the graphics ability of the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.580 
to this test the graphics ability of the
Galaxy<00:01:40.970> star<00:01:41.180> doors<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:48.020> got<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> frame<00:01:48.410> rate<00:01:48.560> of

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
Galaxy star doors we got a frame rate of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.790 
Galaxy star doors we got a frame rate of
30<00:01:48.680> 3.2<00:01:49.460> which<00:01:50.119> means<00:01:50.450> our<00:01:50.600> games<00:01:50.869> are<00:01:51.170> sort<00:01:51.680> of

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
30 3.2 which means our games are sort of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.359 
30 3.2 which means our games are sort of
playable<00:01:52.310> on<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.729> device<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.950> we<00:01:55.009> are<00:01:55.220> going

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
playable on this device now we are going

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.680 
playable on this device now we are going
to<00:01:55.430> run<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.789> multi-touch<00:01:56.149> test<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
to run the multi-touch test on the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.300 
to run the multi-touch test on the
screen<00:01:56.930> I've<00:01:57.110> put<00:01:57.440> four<00:01:57.740> fingers<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
screen I've put four fingers on the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.190 
screen I've put four fingers on the
screen<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.580> as<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.390> can<00:01:59.540> see<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.720> registers

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
screen and as you can see it registers

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.469 
screen and as you can see it registers
only<00:02:00.409> two<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.610> two<00:02:01.850> point<00:02:02.150> multi-touch

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
only two this is a two point multi-touch

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.109 
only two this is a two point multi-touch
display<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.799> that's<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.340> benchmarking<00:02:04.909> on

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
display so that's the benchmarking on

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.690 
display so that's the benchmarking on
the<00:02:05.270> Samsung<00:02:05.689> Galaxy<00:02:05.720> star<00:02:06.350> tours<00:02:06.799> we'll<00:02:07.610> be

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
the Samsung Galaxy star tours we'll be

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.460 
the Samsung Galaxy star tours we'll be
