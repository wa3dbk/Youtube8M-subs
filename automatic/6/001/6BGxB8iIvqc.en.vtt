next evolution of the Kalos region
starters<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.869> starting<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:58.320> chespin<00:01:58.979> even

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
starters so starting with chespin even

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.499 
starters so starting with chespin even
though<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.640> no<00:01:59.880> pictures<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
though we have no pictures of the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.749 
though we have no pictures of the
evolutions<00:02:01.140> yet<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.159> i<00:02:02.189> would<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
evolutions yet but i would think that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
evolutions yet but i would think that
we're<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.149> getting<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:03.869> soon
