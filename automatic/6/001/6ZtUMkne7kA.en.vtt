00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
turning you may have to pair it but for

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.359 
turning you may have to pair it but for
this<00:01:57.869> demonstration<00:01:58.140> I've<00:01:58.770> already<00:01:59.100> paired

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
this demonstration I've already paired

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
this demonstration I've already paired
it<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.729> pretty<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> go<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.469> take<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it and pretty much good to go so take a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
picture and let's see she'll get

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389 
picture and let's see she'll get
something<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.409> there<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.890> again

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
again like I mentioned with the camera

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.059 
again like I mentioned with the camera
grip<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.880> there<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.989> nothing<00:02:59.500> wrong<00:02:59.769> with

grip is that there is nothing wrong with
the<00:03:00.940> hardware<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:02.140> product<00:03:02.590> itself<00:03:03.010> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the hardware the product itself is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.280 
the hardware the product itself is
really<00:03:03.670> amazing<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.360> really<00:03:04.630> unique<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.230> I

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
really amazing and really unique and I

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.039

think<00:03:05.500> balcan<00:03:05.890> has<00:03:06.040> done<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> great<00:03:06.610> job<00:03:06.790> on<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
think balcan has done a great job on the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.800 
think balcan has done a great job on the
actual<00:03:08.440> device<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.940> it's<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.299> that<00:03:10.569> app

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
actual device but it's just that app

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650 
actual device but it's just that app
will<00:03:11.200> lift<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.650> down<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.310> much<00:03:12.610> like<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.450> much

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
will lift it down so much like so much

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.380 
will lift it down so much like so much
that<00:03:13.720> like<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:14.799> man<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.580> wish<00:03:16.239> I

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
that like it's just like man I wish I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.110 
that like it's just like man I wish I
could<00:03:16.540> use<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.140> built-in<00:03:18.070> camera<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:19.090> I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
could use the built-in camera like I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.300 
could use the built-in camera like I
said<00:03:19.359> before<00:03:19.480> are<00:03:19.870> probably<00:03:20.320> some<00:03:20.650> reason<00:03:21.070> why

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
said before are probably some reason why

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.699 
said before are probably some reason why
you<00:03:21.820> know<00:03:21.940> they<00:03:22.150> can't<00:03:22.450> use<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.780> but<00:03:23.530> the

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
you know they can't use it but the

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.380 
you know they can't use it but the
hardware<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.489> amazing<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.329> I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
hardware is just amazing and I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.780 
hardware is just amazing and I
definitely<00:03:25.959> recommend<00:03:26.459> getting<00:03:27.459> something

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
definitely recommend getting something

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.670 
definitely recommend getting something
like<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.019> use<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.530> it

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
like this if you have the use for it

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.800 
like this if you have the use for it
because<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:30.850> great<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.390> if<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.660> can

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
because it's just great and if you can

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.539 
because it's just great and if you can
deal<00:03:32.230> with<00:03:32.470> all<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.130> hiccups<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.690> know

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
deal with all the hiccups and you know

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.509 
deal with all the hiccups and you know
things<00:03:36.549> will<00:03:36.880> happen<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.480> app<00:03:37.840> then

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
things will happen in this app then

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.370 
things will happen in this app then
definitely<00:03:39.519> get<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.660> if<00:03:40.900> you're<00:03:41.079> someone

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
definitely get it but if you're someone

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.860 
definitely get it but if you're someone
who<00:03:41.620> gets<00:03:41.769> really<00:03:42.040> frustrated<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:43.090> small

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870

little things like delays when you take

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.560 
little things like delays when you take
a<00:03:46.420> picture<00:03:46.950> then<00:03:47.950> maybe<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.790> product<00:03:49.150> isn't

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570
