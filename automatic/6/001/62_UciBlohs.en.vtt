00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.189 
they've got some good mass I think this
looks<00:00:42.309> like<00:00:42.489> that<00:00:43.149> could<00:00:43.420> be<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.600> match<00:00:43.870> nope

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
looks like that could be a match nope

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.989 
looks like that could be a match nope
nope<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.679> was<00:00:44.800> gonna<00:00:44.890> say<00:00:45.010> matching<00:00:45.399> set<00:00:45.760> but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
nope I was gonna say matching set but

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.459 
nope I was gonna say matching set but

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
it I don't really know why that would be

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.130 
it I don't really know why that would be
but<00:01:24.070> there's<00:01:24.880> some<00:01:25.060> really<00:01:25.270> good<00:01:25.540> ones<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.960> mean

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
but there's some really good ones I mean

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.800 
but there's some really good ones I mean
we<00:01:26.260> wound<00:01:26.500> up<00:01:26.620> and<00:01:26.860> picked<00:01:27.070> up<00:01:27.280> some<00:01:27.580> I<00:01:28.000> mean

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
we wound up and picked up some I mean

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.300 
we wound up and picked up some I mean
look<00:01:28.960> at<00:01:29.020> this<00:01:29.140> this<00:01:29.410> was<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.620> matching<00:01:30.070> set

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
look at this this was a matching set

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.340 
look at this this was a matching set
right<00:01:30.520> here<00:01:30.700> one<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.940> kids<00:01:31.150> found<00:01:31.450> and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
right here one of the kids found and

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.110 
right here one of the kids found and
that's<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.980> think<00:01:33.340> that's<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.580> matching<00:01:33.940> set

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
that's a I think that's a matching set

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.570 
that's a I think that's a matching set
anyway<00:01:34.480> it<00:01:34.780> looks<00:01:35.290> matching<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.040> me<00:01:36.220> but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
anyway it looks matching to me but
