cornstarch and hydrogen peroxide with

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
cornstarch and hydrogen peroxide with
both<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.850> these<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.360> both<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.870> neutralize

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
both of these they both can neutralize

underarm<00:00:44.370> odor<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.300> only<00:00:45.690> side<00:00:46.200> note<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
underarm odor the only side note is that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
underarm odor the only side note is that
it<00:00:47.489> doesn't<00:00:47.850> last<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.360> long<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.200> may
