00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 yes he had then it's true that there 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.720
 had a little tension between 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.640
 presidents you talked about it at the beginning 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.720
 of the show but you watch them 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.750
 players it was pretty cool 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.570
 before this match there was the challenge and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.769
 jamie roberts who spoke carl hayman 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.109
 o'connor being shown the way 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 by burden the only survivor of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.650
 toulonnais this semifinal and then 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.060
 frederic michalak the first you in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 also talked about motivation 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.609
 yes because there was a little bit of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.350
 hand in the air for racing leads 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.849
 with dimitri szarzewski captain for 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 his return as a titular but look 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.130
 it is the people of Toulon who stand out 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 entrance mark with particular mermoz and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 o'connor and more Toulon 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 more offensive place also a quarter 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.500
 cutei had talked about moving the heavy 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 packs and Ile-de-France and the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.649
 Toulon are quite successful in 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.719
 his register with a game of airy pot 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.980
 rather lively even if it does not mark 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.450
 but he dominates the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.010
 the big first fifteen minutes of this 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.309
 this first half time 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.230
 yes a little in front of burnished end 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.590
 of line and then this fault to the 17th 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.960
 minute 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.480
 the crecq burdet even the hooker who says 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 that he did not hear the referee and that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 creates a little electricity one is a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 unblocker a yellow card and toulon 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.610
 so who will pay for this inferiority 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 digital very quickly mark since 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.780
 three minutes later after a long 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.440
 action that will last a minute 45 all 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.630
 in power 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.280
 racing will register his first try 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 so as I display all his 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.590
 determination by this game to a pass that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.810
 does it sound the charge it's 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.960
 enough before around a very good maxim 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960
 Machenaud 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.710
 diminished by the yellow card of their 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.060
 hooker greg oden and this very long 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.320
 sequence of 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.299
 Parisians who will harass 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.040
 literally the Toulon line 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.810
 until finding the fault by a 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.820
 excellent service from maxime machenaud 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.330
 for for franÃ§ois van der merwe 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.190
 it's the opening of the score is really 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 the racing return with determination 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.330
 finally in this match 7 to 0 so in the 19th 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.360
 minute here is the racing that finally two 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.430
 find fault in the defense 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 toulonnaise racing that comes to dominate 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.180
 from that moment on but look at the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 racing also makes some small 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.030
 errors 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 this cross between the skies and sexton 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.540
 recovery Toulon and the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.520
 Toulon was here not for 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.870
 to do figuration even though the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.550
 composition and tmx that with ten 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.750
 changes made by bernard laporte 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.450
 compared to the winners of the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.570
 rochelle from the previous weekend and david 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.610
 smith there that will revive this balloon released 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.560
 by the youngsters as this fact which 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.080
 supports masoe michalak who alert 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.360
 mermoz then james o'connor for all he 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.069
 saved the young Fijian who will reapply 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.030
 inside to find 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.040
 moore who will go 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.230
 after a clever machenaud in 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.640
 overflow let see the replica to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.100
 about half an hour 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.790
 the Toulons who come back tied 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 so set everywhere marc an action 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.780
 large is beautiful with Frederic 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.700
 michalak madoff who has dared 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.380
 counter-attacked this balloon in the 22 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.790
 Toulon Toulonnais meters faithful 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.620
 also to their early promises of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.720
 match and who is finally rewarded 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.850
 by this magnificent and its contents by the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.520
 Australian prodigy James o'connor and a 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.380
 maxime machenaud penalty that goes 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.019
 allow the information to lead it 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.760
 10-7 at rest here are the same roots 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.380
 well not completely relaxed 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.019
 especially since michalak is at the baguette 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.910
 he's in shape he's well looking here 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.250
 the scrum half the half aperture 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.480
 international east as well but he 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.989
 is one of the players of the three 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 protected players in the group of 30 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.400
 a lot more in the box that me 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.640
 well they stayed serene they go 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.050
 they too counter-attacked almost 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.610
 the time of their in goal a completely 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.610
 of the plume some circumstances the 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.500
 paradox of the match and that the teams that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.660
 then underwent found on the point 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.550
 low of the resources to go 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.320
 seek out here are major actions 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.760
 we saw then there we also saw the beautiful 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.070
 alternation in the game the good return of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.420
 dimitri szarzewski tonight who played 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.390
 a big hour of play the determination 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.130
 of 2 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.319
 Planted plant and adrien planted 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.940
 the former Catalan and then maxime match 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.310
 o'neal always follows the tulle maneuver 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.930
 and especially if you have a disk in place and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.450
 sexton a little unhappy tonight 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.280
 and then again this alternation with 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.510
 the load of trees in the focused and then 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.710
 the movie of maxime machenaud who 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.829
 population victoriously 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.599
 in this crime both in the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.389
 in the last 25 meters to go 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.159
 slump into the in-but everything the 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.650
 racing that takes the score really from 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.979
 pretty clear right now in the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.060
 match 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.699
 49th minute racing that makes a 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.169
 first break 17 to 7 thanks to maxim 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.860
 machenaud but an international scrum 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.879
 racing the cellar a small wheel will have 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.069
 and so the racing breathes 17 to 7 then 10 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.969
 7 to 10 thanks to frederic michalak board 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.990
 key that passes a penalty 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.620
 important 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.190
 here is the racing is within reach of an essay 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.289
 converted 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.389
 this is even a team from Toulon where he 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.009
 there is a big coaching that takes place and 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.620
 always intentions the Toulons 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.840
 will have to push to the end and they have 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.069
 makes the roots tremble even until 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.990
 last look at this particular action 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.030
 with maxim mermoz who looks like james 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.740
 o'connor the speed of the Australian for 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.449
 another one soba happens to pass this balloon 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.520
 you will be the little cut over and 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.039
 unfortunately the Fijian can not 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.449
 resume this balloon flying state in 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.250
 the last minute was that you 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.210
 can be an equalizer ball and the 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.930
 Toulon did not succeed in doing so 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.610
 some by the offensives 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.470
 toulonnaises were programmed in 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.970
 review this action while online 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.250
 three-quarter still stand out james 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.810
 o'connor issued a magnificent pass 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.860
 for for his three quarter wing but 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.310
 it's true that there was also the whole 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.720
 determination your solidarity in a with 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.240
 a climate also a time that has hardened 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.010
 and gusts of rain and wind 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.390
 can be helped also the Parisians to 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.310
 hold this score until the end of the match 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.100
 you have seen revenge is good and 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.450
 may be there with the joy of brice 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.920
 dulin who was not racing even the year 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.860
 last but who was happy happy 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.890
 as Captain Dimitri szarzewski at 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.690
 Micro Nicolas bessat of the one bread 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.830
 was not a spirit of revenge but 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.060
 in any case it's our first match at 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.640
 home but it's up to him to show to 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.160
 our supporters and our motivation 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.040
 for this year at the booth is really 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.330
 faced a very nice team 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.560
 european champion champion of france and 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.180
 so we had to receive them as he 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.400
 must have gone pretty well for us 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.990
 as I told the players if we keep 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.220
 this state of mind we will manage to make 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.900
 good things but be careful you do not have to 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.370
 no longer to race you have to go back down 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.680
 on earth because his chapel is 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.020
 still very complicated we could serve 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.240
 well some b pictures of the year 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.770
 last who served in addition to the 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.430
 motivation but now that's it 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.410
 your championship 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.630
 alou our performance along the 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.650
 season ensures power over will want 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.650
 compete with the best
