00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.110
 hello today on our review 1 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.369
 channel transformer power supply from 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.360
 the company master model mr 5003 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.160
 This power supply has 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.720
 maximum output voltage peres 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.900
 from volt current creampie 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.790
 it is interesting because instead of turning 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.510
 regulators to set the output 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.460
 parameters are used source buttons 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.149
 power supply is standard for appliances 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.120
 this class 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:45.010
 dimensions and weight can around our perimeter 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.390
 on the cooling fins cover on the bottom 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.870
 side four rubber feet bolt 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.179
 which fixed the transformer by 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.859
 back side on which radiator 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.989
 various transistors on dota cover a 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.429
 I will show you later 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.760
 power cable connector and 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:08.170
 fuses consider the front 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.820
 ledge panel and so the power button 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 do we have connectors for 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.620
 loads 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.290
 display where the weekend is displayed 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.570
 LED display options here 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.470
 voltage here and buttons for 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.340
 control with output voltage can 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.740
 to regulate 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 discrete one you also from the button not 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.990
 hidden 10 volt press followed 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.310
 Peter sound is a little unusual so 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.579
 it has current adjustment can 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.700
 carry discrete 10 amps as well 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.799
 there are two LEDs 1 signaling 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.259
 that the power supply is in mode 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.229
 voltage source 2 shows 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.390
 current limiting mode now we 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.549
 demonstrate the main modes of operation 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.479
 power supply for this will be 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.030
 use this sharp mode 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.039
 voltage source 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.310
 for example, I need to set 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:21.150
 voltage 25 you first sets 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:22.860
 integer value then 10 so twenty 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.069
 five volts can connect the load 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.910
 loads of 10 whom, therefore, under the law on 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.910
 the top should be 2 and 5 amps 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.000
 Well, since resistance is not set 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:52.620
 very accurate that little more 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.260
 you can correct this source 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.870
 The power supply is also equipped with a protection system 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.049
 short circuit and system 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.170
 output current stabilization 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.190
 demonstrate protection failures 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.659
 artificially making a short pot on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.110
 legs so we have optical keys to the forehead 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:19.260
 output forging adjust output current 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.620
 In this mode, it is not possible to limit mode 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.450
 current 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.480
 you can set its value only under 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.549
 load load we have 10 com for 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.690
 example do not need to set the output current 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.319
 at one and a half ndpi 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.349
 and using the legs set it 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:44.310
 value you can press alternately you can 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:46.169
 press and hold see our system 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.919
 control automatically the game is nothing 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.540
 output voltage to the level to 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.500
 flowed in the chain of tasks so well for example 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.500
 set 13 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.909
 I can then 2 amps 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:15.219
 voltage of about 20 volts consider 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:19.359
 the inside of the device is toroidal 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:23.320
 transformer main board on 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.289
 capacitor diode bridge relays which 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.509
 switch river windings 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:32.410
 transformer if we have a fee 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:36.759
 display and control board output 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:41.680
 connectors and radiators 2 bipolar 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:44.710
 transistors power supply master anar 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.710
 5003 m is a great choice for an amateur 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.150
 and professional due to low price 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.650
 wide range of output parameters and 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.650
 good quality workmanship
