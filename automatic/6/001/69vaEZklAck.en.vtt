 how to close the rom completely and what 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.610
 Well, it's much faster 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.160
 rom and decreases memory space 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.290
 internal as you can see the breaks occupied 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.570
 fifty-four megabytes and I do not have 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.490
 no installed application does not matter 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.800
 whether or not we have an application or game 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.900

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.250

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.330
 then we will install from siddiqa 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.009
 followed by chooz zip then we search and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.730
 channel 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.890
 this process I just tried it in a 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.750
 break or undo what I wanted to try in a 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.850
 burglary to free up more space 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.220
 still but it did not work me at the beginning 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.380
 at the end of the video I will leave you a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.150

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.140
 installed terminal application 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.340
 well now we open the application 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.640
 terminal then we will come out what they see 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.689
 allow 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.879
 then we write what I will leave them in 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.780
 a note to remember space between the 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.780
 text and the script 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.620
 then we give in enter 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.630
 will load a small text and then 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.080
 we rewrote what I will leave them in 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.080
 a note 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.880
 again we give it to 20 and we expect a 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.730
 couple of minutes until the end of 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.700
