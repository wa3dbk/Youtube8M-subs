going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.589> be<00:00:04.710> discussing<00:00:05.069> stick<00:00:05.460> Heights

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
going to be discussing stick Heights

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.150 
going to be discussing stick Heights
stick<00:00:06.779> Heights<00:00:06.990> are<00:00:07.140> very<00:00:07.410> important<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.099> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
stick Heights are very important in a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.400 
stick Heights are very important in a
drumline<00:00:08.670> ensemble<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.960> make<00:00:10.110> sure<00:00:10.260> that

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
drumline ensemble to make sure that

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.530 
drumline ensemble to make sure that
we're<00:00:10.559> all<00:00:10.590> matching<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> same<00:00:11.790> sound<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
we're all matching the same sound and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.460 
we're all matching the same sound and
the<00:00:12.900> same<00:00:13.139> height<00:00:13.469> visually<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> crowd

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
the same height visually for the crowd

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.510 
the same height visually for the crowd
now<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.740> define<00:00:17.220> stick<00:00:17.640> Heights<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.060> inches

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
now I define stick Heights in inches

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.810 
now I define stick Heights in inches
inches<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.660> drum<00:00:22.340> first<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.550> we're

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
inches from the drum first off we're

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.040 
inches from the drum first off we're
going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> start<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.390> our<00:00:24.449> ready<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> play

going to start on our ready to play

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.830 
going to start on our ready to play
position<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.820> want<00:00:27.029> something<00:00:27.269> played<00:00:27.660> from

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
position if I want something played from

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.109 
position if I want something played from
this<00:00:28.019> position<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.710> call<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.730> inch<00:00:29.910> off<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
this position I call it one inch off of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.799 
this position I call it one inch off of
the<00:00:30.330> drum<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:32.070> next<00:00:32.369> position<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.239> call

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.049 
the drum the next position up I call
three<00:00:34.260> inches<00:00:34.620> off<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> drum<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.820> what

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
three inches off of the drum now what

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
three inches off of the drum now what
how<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.680> make<00:00:37.890> sure<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
how I do that is I make sure that I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.600 
how I do that is I make sure that I
change<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.420> stick<00:00:39.660> angle<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.649> being<00:00:41.370> two

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
change my stick angle from being two

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.510 
change my stick angle from being two
fingers<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.690> making<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.140> wrists<00:00:43.520> parallel

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
fingers off to making my wrists parallel

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.940 
fingers off to making my wrists parallel
to<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> ground

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
to the ground

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
to the ground
versus<00:00:46.950> having<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.030> finger<00:00:48.329> angle<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
versus having that two finger angle to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
versus having that two finger angle to
the<00:00:48.809> drum<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.920> inch<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.180> three

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the drum this is one inch this is three

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.040 
the drum this is one inch this is three
inches<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> next<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.420> try<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> define

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
inches the next one that I try to define

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.040 
inches the next one that I try to define
is<00:00:55.289> twelve<00:00:55.620> inches<00:00:55.739> now<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.329> having<00:00:57.809> our

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
is twelve inches now that is having our

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
is twelve inches now that is having our
stick<00:00:58.520> 100%<00:01:00.379> perpendicular<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.890> ground

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
stick 100% perpendicular to the ground

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.420 
stick 100% perpendicular to the ground
this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> twelve<00:01:03.270> inches<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.739> we

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this is twelve inches so going up we

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
this is twelve inches so going up we
start<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.350> then<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.470> make<00:01:07.650> our<00:01:07.799> wrists

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
start at one then we make our wrists

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.899 
start at one then we make our wrists
flat<00:01:08.460> three<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:10.170> perpendicular<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
flat three then perpendicular to the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.990 
flat three then perpendicular to the
ground<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.450> 12<00:01:12.659> inches<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> next<00:01:14.490> height<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
ground for 12 inches the next height I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.469 
ground for 12 inches the next height I
define<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.200> six<00:01:16.619> inches<00:01:17.070> easiest<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> do

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
define is six inches easiest way to do

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.740 
define is six inches easiest way to do
this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> dollar<00:01:19.890> bill<00:01:20.630> stick<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
this is to take a dollar bill stick it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.289 
this is to take a dollar bill stick it
on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> drum<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:24.240> match<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:25.830> tip

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
on the drum and then match the very tip

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.200 
on the drum and then match the very tip
to<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> top<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> dollar<00:01:28.110> bill<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.090> I've

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
to the top of that dollar bill so I've

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
to the top of that dollar bill so I've
got<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.259> inch<00:01:31.439> I've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:32.759> wrist<00:01:32.970> flat

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.590 
got my one inch I've got my wrist flat
at<00:01:33.420> three<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.560> I've<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:34.890> six<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
at three and then I've got my six then I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.340 
at three and then I've got my six then I
have<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:36.990> twelve<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:39.270> next<00:01:39.630> high<00:01:39.810> tide<00:01:39.840> define

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
have my twelve the next high tide define

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
have my twelve the next high tide define
is<00:01:41.150> finding<00:01:42.150> six<00:01:42.450> inches<00:01:43.729> finding<00:01:44.729> twelve

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
is finding six inches finding twelve

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.170 
is finding six inches finding twelve
inches<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:46.619> splitting<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
inches and then splitting it this is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.539 
inches and then splitting it this is
what<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> call<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.750> nine<00:01:48.960> inches<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.430> up
