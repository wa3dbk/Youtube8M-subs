00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.760
 Hello, this is Jorge de Ferrol, about 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.610
 of it I want to show this saw 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.080
 The short manufacturer's folding is a 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.690
 saw as you can see totally 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.860
 folding that closes completely and 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.570
 next I will comment on 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.089
 main features you can 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.390
 see when opening it take a system of 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.980
 subject so that we do not move the 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.140
 sierra we lose here we do not know 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.789
 it would be totally fixed what 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 has this saw features 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.689
 with respect to others that we can shorten 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.059
 in the market mainly the sheet of 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.860
 steel if you can see here the sheet 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.600
 Steel for the part is fully 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.920
 smooth so that at the time of closing no 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.780
 we have problems that we are 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.030
 hook and at the top is 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.410
 much thinner than the bottom part of 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.390
 inside 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.150
 so that it will be much better and more 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.510
 comfortable the cut for example the teeth 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.160
 they have a tilt of 225 millimeters 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.800
 so that at the time of closing both towards 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.290
 in front of the center, we come much better in 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.340
 the saw blade and third high 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.640
 carbon 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.230
 sk 5 is flexible but at the same time very hard 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.999
 Many people will say that it is flexible 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.149
 but good also offers but the 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.149
 maker 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.580
 it's flexible but the truth is a lot 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.310
 resistance 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 the fully open length is of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.440
 about 40 centimeters closed we would have 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.350
 approximately we are going to close the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.500
 sidewalks and have approximately 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.480
 24 centimeters and the sheet the length of 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.180
 the saw of about 18 centimeters the 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.460
 mango and polypropylene handle good 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.810
 has a comfortable grip you can see what 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.020
 animal or as it does not have here enough 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.090
 space to catch it and good according to 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.820
 the manufacturer says that you can see it 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.620
 in the dress of the sheet says that at 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.140
 take an inclination what the toothing of 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.330
 2.25 can not we will not need 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.110
 sharpen them for a long time 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.880
 approximately has a weight of about 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.320
 160 grams weighs a little and it will come 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 very good for our activities to the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 open air to close to look for treki 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.729
 and even for our garden I hope 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.510
 that this information has served you 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.510
 help a greeting
