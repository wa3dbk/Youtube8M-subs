when we first started in 1996 we pursued

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.030 
when we first started in 1996 we pursued
the<00:00:52.540> high<00:00:52.660> technology<00:00:53.290> part<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.649> market

the high technology part of the market
and<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.579> reason<00:00:54.880> we<00:00:54.970> did<00:00:55.180> this<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.600> because<00:00:55.750> we

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
and the reason we did this is because we

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.229 
and the reason we did this is because we
believe<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.860> technology<00:00:57.220> separates<00:00:58.000> us<00:00:58.180> from

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
