00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.810 

now<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.110> dark<00:01:30.350> world<00:01:30.530> versus<00:01:30.920> agents<00:01:31.460> intro

now the dark world versus agents intro

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.700 
now the dark world versus agents intro
was<00:01:31.970> created<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:32.570> campbellton<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.170> really<00:01:33.500> love

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
was created by campbellton I really love

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.860 
was created by campbellton I really love
the<00:01:33.860> way<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.910> camera<00:01:35.060> kind<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.420> zooms<00:01:35.690> around

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
the way the camera kind of zooms around

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.660 
the way the camera kind of zooms around
through<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.470> sky<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.950> stuff<00:01:37.160> it<00:01:37.340> was<00:01:37.430> one<00:01:37.640> of

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
through the sky and stuff it was one of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.820 
through the sky and stuff it was one of
our<00:01:37.850> earlier<00:01:38.300> ones<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.230> I<00:01:39.350> still<00:01:39.530> think<00:01:39.710> it's

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
our earlier ones and I still think it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.740 
our earlier ones and I still think it's
probably<00:01:39.980> one<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.090> more<00:01:41.300> better<00:01:41.450> ones

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
probably one of the the more better ones

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.290 
probably one of the the more better ones
out<00:01:42.020> there<00:01:42.430> doesn't<00:01:43.430> really<00:01:43.580> feature<00:01:43.820> any<00:01:44.150> of

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
out there doesn't really feature any of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.810 
out there doesn't really feature any of
the<00:01:44.450> characters<00:01:44.720> per<00:01:45.320> se<00:01:45.530> from<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.950> decks<00:01:46.520> in

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
the characters per se from the decks in

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.030 
the characters per se from the decks in
the<00:01:47.090> video<00:01:47.360> but<00:01:47.690> I<00:01:47.870> just<00:01:48.410> think<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.830> kind<00:01:48.980> of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the video but I just think it kind of

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.330 
the video but I just think it kind of
captures<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.460> lot<00:01:49.730> with<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:51.380> feeling<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.220> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
captures a lot with the feeling of the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.620 
captures a lot with the feeling of the
decks<00:01:52.550> or<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.820> moods<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.270> they<00:01:53.390> kind<00:01:53.570> of

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
decks or the moods that they kind of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.180 
decks or the moods that they kind of
creator<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.380> think<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.800> when<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.070> think

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
creator that you think of when you think

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.550 
creator that you think of when you think
of<00:01:55.430> either<00:01:55.640> agent<00:01:56.060> fairies<00:01:56.480> and<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.960> course

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
of either agent fairies and of course

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.490 
of either agent fairies and of course
dark<00:01:57.800> world<00:01:58.150> with<00:01:59.150> that<00:01:59.300> said<00:01:59.570> let's<00:02:00.140> get<00:02:00.290> to

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
dark world with that said let's get to

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:30.790 
dark world with that said let's get to
our<00:02:00.530> number<00:02:01.190> four<00:02:01.490> video

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.890 

now<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.860> harpy<00:02:32.250> lady<00:02:32.459> versus<00:02:32.940> volcanic<00:02:33.510> intro

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
now the harpy lady versus volcanic intro

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.420 
now the harpy lady versus volcanic intro
was<00:02:34.080> probably<00:02:34.319> one<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> first<00:02:34.950> ones<00:02:35.190> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
was probably one of the first ones that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.220 
was probably one of the first ones that
I<00:02:35.459> created<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.120> really<00:02:36.540> personally<00:02:36.990> liked

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
I created that I really personally liked

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
I was really proud of that especially at

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.390 
I was really proud of that especially at
the<00:02:49.020> time<00:02:49.230> when<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.500> did<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.250> fire

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
effect that I was able to come up with

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.199 
effect that I was able to come up with
for<00:02:52.080> volcanic<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.580> kind<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.819> panning

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
for volcanic and the kind of panning

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.440 
for volcanic and the kind of panning
that<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.390> did<00:02:54.569> around<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.770> cyber<00:02:56.040> harpie<00:02:56.489> in

that I did around the cyber harpie in
her<00:02:58.170> portion<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.860> thing<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.310> thought<00:02:59.430> it

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
her portion of the thing I thought it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.300 
her portion of the thing I thought it
was<00:02:59.610> kind<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.819> cool<00:02:59.970> anyways<00:03:00.690> let's<00:03:00.989> get<00:03:01.800> on<00:03:01.950> to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
extremely long amount of time to kind of

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.140 
extremely long amount of time to kind of
come<00:03:47.370> up<00:03:47.489> with<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:47.820> those<00:03:47.940> different

intro is another one that I had come up

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.469 
intro is another one that I had come up
with<00:04:34.320> again<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.340> really<00:04:35.580> like<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.820> panning<00:04:36.240> in

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479

both<00:04:36.690> segments<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.560> centro<00:04:37.949> as<00:04:38.070> well<00:04:38.250> as

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
both segments of the centro as well as

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.790 
both segments of the centro as well as
the<00:04:38.520> snow<00:04:38.790> effect<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:40.229> music<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.710> all

different forbidden list not the current

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:39.579 
different forbidden list not the current
one<00:06:38.509> because<00:06:38.719> we've<00:06:38.839> created<00:06:39.079> these<00:06:39.319> over<00:06:39.559> a

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:39.589 
one because we've created these over a

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:41.829 
one because we've created these over a
long<00:06:39.889> period<00:06:39.919> of<00:06:40.399> time<00:06:40.459> so<00:06:41.149> if<00:06:41.239> you<00:06:41.329> see<00:06:41.479> a<00:06:41.509> card
