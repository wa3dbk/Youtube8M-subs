00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.520 

you<00:02:16.520> hit<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> base<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.230> Strom

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
you hit the base I like just Strom

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.440 
you hit the base I like just Strom
either<00:02:18.770> these<00:02:18.980> two<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.490> power<00:02:19.700> cord<00:02:19.940> or

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.780 

there's<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.710> one<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.130> beat<00:02:38.520> right

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
there's like one little beat right

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.130 
there's like one little beat right
before<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.300> would<00:02:39.420> imagine<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.930> should

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
before you would imagine you should

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.510 
before you would imagine you should
switch<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:40.830> gotta<00:02:41.040> listen<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.430> play

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
switch so I just gotta listen and play

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.210 
switch so I just gotta listen and play
along<00:02:41.820> like<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:43.410> kind<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> little<00:02:43.980> bit

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
along like it kind of has a little bit

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.490 
along like it kind of has a little bit
of<00:02:44.280> an<00:02:44.580> off<00:02:44.760> switch<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.170> doesn't<00:02:46.440> go

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
of an off switch like it doesn't go

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.970 
of an off switch like it doesn't go
directly<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.460> beach<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.000> tiny<00:02:48.180> bit

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
directly on the beach just a tiny bit

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.900 
directly on the beach just a tiny bit
after<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.280> think<00:02:52.430> where<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.520> can<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:53.790> hit

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
after it I think where you can just hit

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:06.229 
after it I think where you can just hit
this<00:02:54.150> chord<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.600> whole<00:02:54.720> time

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.870 

be<00:03:07.239> nice<00:03:07.480> for<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> while<00:03:07.840> G<00:03:08.200> minor<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.860> see<00:03:09.160> every

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.470 

you<00:03:12.880> take<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.420> base

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
you take the base

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.640 
you take the base
yes

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.940 

you<00:03:23.650> can<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:23.920> when<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.159> switch<00:03:24.370> chords<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.819> go

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you can do when you switch chords and go

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.580 
you can do when you switch chords and go
seven<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.040> eight<00:03:27.810> or<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.930> can<00:03:29.080> do<00:03:29.170> this<00:03:29.349> at<00:03:29.500> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
seven to eight or you can do this at the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.449 
seven to eight or you can do this at the
end<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> career<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.040> guy<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
end of the career like the guy in the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.250 
end of the career like the guy in the
tap<00:03:36.640> has<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:37.090> idea<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.840> note<00:03:38.019> is

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
tap has that idea and that note is

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.110 
tap has that idea and that note is
played<00:03:38.290> but<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.190> me<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.489> jumps<00:03:39.970> out<00:03:40.060> of

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
played but to me it just jumps out of

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.850 
played but to me it just jumps out of
nowhere<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.750> don't<00:03:40.900> like<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.560> do

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
nowhere so I don't like it so I just do

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.150 
nowhere so I don't like it so I just do
this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
this

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.080 
this
ah<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.390> could<00:03:43.660> go<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.849> think<00:03:45.849> if<00:03:45.970> you're

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
ah so you could go I think if you're

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.070 
ah so you could go I think if you're
strumming<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.480> whole<00:03:46.569> chords<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:46.989> would

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
strumming the whole chords it would

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.830 
strumming the whole chords it would
sound<00:03:47.230> okay

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.280 

I

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:08.580

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
and I was starting to think maybe a

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.670 
and I was starting to think maybe a
diminished<00:06:59.700> chord<00:06:59.820> sound<00:07:00.150> better<00:07:00.330> I<00:07:00.600> tried<00:07:01.590> to

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
diminished chord sound better I tried to

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.290 
diminished chord sound better I tried to
strumming<00:07:02.070> it<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.520> the<00:07:02.610> faun<00:07:02.880> diminished

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
chord sounds kind of stupid but this way

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.940

a<00:07:05.130> diminished<00:07:05.670> chord<00:07:05.790> sounds<00:07:06.180> good<00:07:06.390> so<00:07:06.950> you

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950
