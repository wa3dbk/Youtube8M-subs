here<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.170> another<00:00:10.349> upgrade<00:00:10.950> from<00:00:11.130> an<00:00:11.309> RC

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
here I have another upgrade from an RC

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
here I have another upgrade from an RC
workspace<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.809> donated<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> me<00:00:13.469> by

man<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.910> rpm's<00:00:18.480> toe<00:00:18.960> engaged<00:00:19.680> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
man now this is rpm's toe engaged a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
man now this is rpm's toe engaged a
rather<00:00:20.310> important<00:00:21.210> thing<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.869> when<00:00:22.199> it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
rather important thing to have when it

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.080 
rather important thing to have when it
comes<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.830> getting<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.699> performance

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
comes to getting the right performance

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390 
comes to getting the right performance
off<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.570> RC<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.590> let's<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.920> ahead<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.279> open

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
off your RC so let's go ahead and open

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.929 
off your RC so let's go ahead and open
it<00:00:26.670> up<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.000> check<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:28.609> we're<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.640> gonna

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it up and check it out we're just gonna

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
it up and check it out we're just gonna
go<00:00:30.150> ahead<00:00:30.240> rip<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.019> open<00:00:31.500> pull<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
go ahead rip it on open pull out the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.209 
go ahead rip it on open pull out the
gauge<00:00:32.460> itself<00:00:33.590> you've<00:00:34.590> got<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> couple<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
gauge itself you've got a couple of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.639 
gauge itself you've got a couple of
extra<00:00:35.550> parts<00:00:36.469> instructions<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.620> course

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
extra parts instructions of course

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.639 
extra parts instructions of course
followed<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.700> an<00:00:39.120> RPM<00:00:39.600> sticker<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.230> big<00:00:40.440> one

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
followed by an RPM sticker the big one

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.580 
followed by an RPM sticker the big one
this<00:00:40.800> time<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.910> packaged<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.350> other

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
this time to packaged it and that other

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.760 
this time to packaged it and that other
piece<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.350> yet<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
piece what these are I don't know yet so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
piece what these are I don't know yet so
it's<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> read<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> instructions<00:00:48.239> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it's time to read the instructions so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.630 
it's time to read the instructions so
here's<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> diagram<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.460> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
here's a diagram on how to use this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
here's a diagram on how to use this
thing<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.750> pieces<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.739> see

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
thing as for these pieces you can see

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
thing as for these pieces you can see
that<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.640> small<00:00:54.090> tires<00:00:54.390> you're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that if you have small tires you're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
that if you have small tires you're
gonna<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> set<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> underneath<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> tire

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
gonna want to set it underneath the tire

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
gonna want to set it underneath the tire
that<00:00:56.969> way<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> elevates<00:00:57.750> RRC<00:00:58.289> enough<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> can

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that way it elevates RRC enough so I can

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
that way it elevates RRC enough so I can
use<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> gauge<00:00:59.489> properly<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.750> off-road

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
use this gauge properly but for off-road

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840 
use this gauge properly but for off-road
vehicles<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.250> don't<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> do

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
vehicles you really don't have to do

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000 
vehicles you really don't have to do
that<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:03.870> you're<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.799> you're

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that so what you're gonna do is you're

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.070 
that so what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:01:05.070> find<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> ridge<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
gonna find a ridge and use the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.859 
gonna find a ridge and use the
corresponding<00:01:07.439> ridge<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.700> set<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.180> each<00:01:09.420> side

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
corresponding ridge to set up each side

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.460 
corresponding ridge to set up each side
of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.040> toe<00:01:11.280> engage<00:01:11.909> once<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> line<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.439> up

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
of the toe engage once you line that up

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
of the toe engage once you line that up
then<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.400> gonna<00:01:14.520> move<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.150> front

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
then you're gonna move it to the front

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
then you're gonna move it to the front
without<00:01:15.930> messing<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.979> you'd<00:01:17.549> line<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
without messing it up and you'd line it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.230 
without messing it up and you'd line it
up<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> same<00:01:19.170> ridges<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.000> see

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
up with the same ridges now you can see

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.649 
up with the same ridges now you can see
from<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:23.030> three<00:01:24.030> marks<00:01:24.450> in

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
from this one I have three marks in

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
from this one I have three marks in
which<00:01:24.930> means<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> three<00:01:25.920> degree

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
which means I have a three degree

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.219 
which means I have a three degree
toe<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.540> which<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> fine<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:29.930> but<00:01:30.930> after

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
toe in which is fine with me but after

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
toe in which is fine with me but after
every<00:01:31.470> crash<00:01:31.770> after<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> long<00:01:32.909> time<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
every crash after a long time of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359 
every crash after a long time of
performance<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.439> literally<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.829> screw

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
performance you can literally just screw

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.670 
performance you can literally just screw
in<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.880> knob<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.869> locks<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.560> way

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
in this knob and it locks it that way

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.260 
in this knob and it locks it that way
you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.950> check<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.310> every<00:01:38.610> single<00:01:38.820> time<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you can check it every single time to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
you can check it every single time to
make<00:01:39.390> sure<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:40.079> towing<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
make sure that your towing is at the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.880 
make sure that your towing is at the
right<00:01:41.400> angle<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.119> want<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:43.290> each<00:01:43.500> RC

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
right angle that you want with each RC

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
right angle that you want with each RC
you're<00:01:44.130> obviously<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> change<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
you're obviously gonna have to change it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.639 
you're obviously gonna have to change it
if<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:46.799> two<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:48.270> too<00:01:48.630> wide<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.290> RC

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
if these two are too wide for your RC

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.020 
if these two are too wide for your RC
then<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.280> notches<00:01:50.700> on

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
then you have these little notches on

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270 
then you have these little notches on
the<00:01:51.119> inside<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.810> works<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.439> smaller<00:01:52.770> RCS

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the inside so this works for smaller RCS

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
the inside so this works for smaller RCS
as<00:01:53.460> well<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.840> choose<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> buy<00:01:55.439> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
as well so if you do choose to buy this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560
