00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.290
 ah 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.770
 Czech 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.120
 today the word invited us to 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.370
 keep us in faith 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.700
 perhaps 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.800
 We did not make it 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.039
 the things that we want as fast as 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.189
 we love them 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.040
 maybe sometimes we get impatient 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.970
 silence of God or the apparent silence 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.480
 of God 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.149
 Sometimes we feel lonely 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.740
 we see that he is on our side not 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.290
 We are sorry, acting 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.750
 sometimes 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.210
 we need 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.230
 see his power in our midst 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.440
 and we doubt 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.990
 and we say to keep praying and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.680
 we say to keep believing 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:07.450
 well today the invitation is to be 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 persevering in prayer today the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.310
 prayer invites us not to leave aside 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.650
 our faith 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.420
 to stand firm and be clear 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.520
 that the fate of the just and the ungodly 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:32.090
 is the same 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:34.450
 the fate of the righteous and the wicked is not 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.450
 the same 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.010
 with that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.619
 and keep an eye on that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 it's worth it 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 that we today have in mind that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.190
 it is not the same to be the bad one to do good 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.210
 is not true 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.800
 it's not true I do not know how bad it's going 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.840
 well apparently 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.840
 they fall like coconut I assure you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.679
 and we have to be persistent in 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.080
 our faith and in our prayers be good 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.819
 for your convictions be good for your 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.880
 values â€‹â€‹be good because we want them 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.320
 so it has to be 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.960
 so we have to live without fear 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.030
 trusting and believing in the Lord for 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.150
 get ahead 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.170

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.170
