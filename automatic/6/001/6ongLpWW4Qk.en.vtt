indicate but just talked about towards

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.190 
indicate but just talked about towards
the<00:04:35.360> end<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.600> game<00:04:35.630> in<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:35.930> fourth

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
the end of the game in that fourth

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.900 
the end of the game in that fourth
quarter<00:04:36.560> holding<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> lead<00:04:37.700> when<00:04:37.790> they

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
quarter holding on to the lead when they

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.610 
quarter holding on to the lead when they
made<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> little<00:04:38.240> run<00:04:38.480> there<00:04:38.660> well<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.320> think<00:04:39.380> the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
made a little run there well I think the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.260 
made a little run there well I think the
big<00:04:39.770> thing<00:04:39.800> was<00:04:40.160> we<00:04:40.370> really<00:04:40.610> executed<00:04:41.120> in<00:04:41.180> the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
big thing was we really executed in the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.910 
big thing was we really executed in the
end<00:04:41.450> we<00:04:41.960> weren't<00:04:42.140> having<00:04:42.260> as<00:04:42.440> many<00:04:42.560> turnovers

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
end we weren't having as many turnovers

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.590 
end we weren't having as many turnovers
as<00:04:43.220> we<00:04:43.340> did<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.580> first<00:04:43.820> half<00:04:43.970> hanging<00:04:44.540> in

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
as we did in the first half hanging in

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.270 
as we did in the first half hanging in
the<00:04:44.690> first<00:04:44.900> half<00:04:45.050> we<00:04:45.260> had<00:04:45.290> close<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.800> 10<00:04:46.040> maybe

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
the first half we had close to 10 maybe

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.250 
the first half we had close to 10 maybe
12<00:04:46.610> turnovers<00:04:46.880> but<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.600> think<00:04:47.780> in<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.930> second

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
12 turnovers but I think in the second

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.050 
12 turnovers but I think in the second
half<00:04:48.380> we<00:04:48.560> really<00:04:49.130> slim<00:04:49.370> down<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.640> turnovers

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
half we really slim down the turnovers

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.150 
half we really slim down the turnovers
and<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.360> held<00:04:50.750> onto<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.050> ball<00:04:51.140> better<00:04:51.350> and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
and just held onto the ball better and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.910 
and just held onto the ball better and
in<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.090> first<00:04:53.330> step<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.840> know<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.200> was<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> slow

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
in the first step you know it was a slow

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.920 
in the first step you know it was a slow
down<00:04:55.130> game<00:04:55.460> kind<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.850> seems<00:04:56.510> like<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.720> pace

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
down game kind of seems like the pace

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.960 
down game kind of seems like the pace
kind<00:04:57.260> of<00:04:57.380> increased<00:04:57.860> as<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.490> game<00:04:58.640> went<00:04:58.820> on

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
kind of increased as the game went on

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.880 
kind of increased as the game went on
and<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.270> guys<00:04:59.420> got<00:04:59.630> some<00:04:59.780> easy<00:04:59.990> baskets<00:05:00.230> just

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
mean they're our rivals so I mean we can

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.550 
mean they're our rivals so I mean we can
always<00:05:38.570> get<00:05:38.720> up<00:05:38.810> for<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.020> game<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.260> just

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
always get up for this game and just

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.650 
always get up for this game and just
really<00:05:39.800> get<00:05:39.980> pumped<00:05:40.280> about<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.760> actually

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
really get pumped about it I actually

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.180 
really get pumped about it I actually
think<00:05:41.960> we<00:05:42.110> got<00:05:42.230> a<00:05:42.260> little<00:05:42.350> bit<00:05:42.620> too<00:05:42.740> amped<00:05:42.950> up

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
think we got a little bit too amped up

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.100 
think we got a little bit too amped up
in<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.430> beginning<00:05:43.580> but<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.750> probably<00:05:44.930> came

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
in the beginning but it probably came

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.840 
in the beginning but it probably came
out<00:05:45.260> shopping<00:05:45.650> because<00:05:45.770> of<00:05:46.040> that<00:05:46.190> but<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.730> mean

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
out shopping because of that but I mean

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.160 
out shopping because of that but I mean
there<00:05:47.150> are<00:05:47.240> rabbits<00:05:47.420> so<00:05:47.750> we're<00:05:47.870> always<00:05:47.960> going

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
there are rabbits so we're always going

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.630 
there are rabbits so we're always going
