00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
we'd we start to work to a bit of the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
we'd we start to work to a bit of the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
need to get through alright so I thought

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
need to get through alright so I thought
I'd<00:00:27.539> start<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.400> largely<00:00:29.400> just

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I'd start with this one largely just

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
I'd start with this one largely just
because<00:00:29.970> I've<00:00:30.119> never<00:00:30.630> ever<00:00:31.230> heard<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.769> in

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
because I've never ever heard of this in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.350 
because I've never ever heard of this in
my<00:00:32.009> entire<00:00:32.070> life<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:32.730> no<00:00:32.969> idea<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
my entire life I've no idea what the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.500 
my entire life I've no idea what the
hell<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.770> find<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
hell that is so we're gonna find out I

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
hell that is so we're gonna find out I
we<00:00:36.510> did<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.829> well<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> started<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> you
