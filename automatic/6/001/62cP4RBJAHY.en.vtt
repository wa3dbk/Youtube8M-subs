actual active arrow in there as well so
in<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.200> corners<00:00:44.560> you<00:00:44.770> need<00:00:45.130> downforce<00:00:45.730> so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
in the corners you need downforce so

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.670 
in the corners you need downforce so
you've<00:00:46.510> got<00:00:46.630> some<00:00:46.750> flaps<00:00:46.990> under<00:00:47.260> here<00:00:47.440> that

yeah<00:01:13.840> pushes<00:01:14.469> these<00:01:14.619> flaps<00:01:14.920> in<00:01:15.130> here<00:01:15.310> open<00:01:15.759> and

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
yeah pushes these flaps in here open and

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.120 
yeah pushes these flaps in here open and
directs<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.749> air<00:01:16.780> away<00:01:17.049> from<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.590> radiators

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
directs the air away from the radiators

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.230 
directs the air away from the radiators
which<00:01:18.280> don't<00:01:18.520> need<00:01:18.639> it<00:01:18.789> at<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:18.999> sort<00:01:19.210> of

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
which don't need it at that sort of

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.059 
which don't need it at that sort of
speed<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.719> then<00:01:20.020> funnels<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.649> down<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.920> side

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
speed and then funnels it down the side

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.819 
speed and then funnels it down the side
of<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.249> car<00:01:21.429> to<00:01:21.670> improve<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.030> aerodynamics

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829

of the car to improve the aerodynamics
220<00:01:23.829> kilometers<00:01:24.130> an<00:01:24.189> hour<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:25.060> then<00:01:25.299> loads

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
220 kilometers an hour this then loads

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.239 
220 kilometers an hour this then loads
as<00:01:25.749> well<00:01:25.929> which<00:01:26.409> stabilizes<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:27.130> Aero

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
as well which stabilizes the Aero

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:28.370 
as well which stabilizes the Aero

weight<00:02:19.750> these<00:02:20.440> side<00:02:20.680> windows<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
weight these side windows on the

weight these side windows on the
windscreen<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.670> slightly<00:02:21.910> thinner<00:02:22.210> glass<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
windscreen is slightly thinner glass and

windscreen is slightly thinner glass and
it's<00:02:22.960> lexan<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.710> rear<00:02:23.860> engine<00:02:24.070> cover

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
it's lexan for the rear engine cover

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.630 
it's lexan for the rear engine cover
so<00:02:25.260> yeah<00:02:26.260> awful<00:02:26.830> lot<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:26.950> weight<00:02:27.130> thing<00:02:27.370> going

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
so yeah awful lot of weight thing going

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.430 
so yeah awful lot of weight thing going
on<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:27.940> helps<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.570> get<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.840> incredible

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
on which helps it to get that incredible

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.650 
on which helps it to get that incredible
looks<00:02:29.650> it's<00:02:29.890> 2<00:02:30.100> mile<00:02:30.280> an<00:02:30.370> hour<00:02:30.460> time<00:02:30.730> price

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
looks it's 2 mile an hour time price

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.090 
looks it's 2 mile an hour time price
well<00:02:31.960> they<00:02:32.050> haven't<00:02:32.260> confirmed<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.680> yet<00:02:32.710> but

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
well they haven't confirmed it yet but

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.470 
well they haven't confirmed it yet but
