exact night we started developing

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.509 
exact night we started developing
different<00:00:49.080> prototypes<00:00:49.379> these<00:00:50.220> are<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.400> first

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
different prototypes these are the first

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.700 
different prototypes these are the first
time<00:00:50.729> they've<00:00:50.970> been<00:00:51.000> seen<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.479> the<00:00:51.870> world<00:00:52.050> then

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
time they've been seen in the world then

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
time they've been seen in the world then
you<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> dagger<00:00:53.610> type<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> variant

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you got like a dagger type of variant

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.049 
you got like a dagger type of variant
it's<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.839> false<00:00:55.140> edge<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.589> top<00:00:55.760> full<00:00:56.760> grind

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's a false edge on the top full grind

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
it's a false edge on the top full grind
on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.269> bottom<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.199> said<00:00:58.470> serrated

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
on the bottom and I said serrated

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
on the bottom and I said serrated
versions<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.870> even<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.049> bull<00:01:01.260> nosed

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
versions and even like a bull nosed

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.890 
versions and even like a bull nosed
version<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.250> other<00:01:02.400> big<00:01:02.610> change<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.299> that<00:01:03.360> a
