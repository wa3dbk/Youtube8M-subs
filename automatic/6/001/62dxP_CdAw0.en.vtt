00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 the dry systems represent the ideal solution for the interventions of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.510
 renovation and adaptation of existing buildings 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.369
 their performance guarantees excellent results of acoustic thermal insulation 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.539
 that of fire protection 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.849
 in this video we provide all the basic indications to realize in 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.380
 correct dry construction method suitable for achieving the result 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.379
 wanted 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.940
 for the realization of the dry walls knauf is able to offer all 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.610
 the range of products needed for correct installation to guarantee performance 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.190
 hanging 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.500
 to support the laying activity 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.020
 knauf also offers a wide range of specially designed accessories 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.280
 to facilitate the installation of dry systems 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.890
 system performance is achieved with the correct use of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 all products made available 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.190
 the installation begins with the tracking of the position of the wall 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.579
 proceed by marking the signs indicating the position of the guide profile on the ground 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 with the use of the sepia the position of the profiles is reported both on the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 perimeter walls than on the floor 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.470
 then all the positions of the profiles will be marked will fall on the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.470
 wall perimeter 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.840
 through the use of a bar of wire it keeps marked the line on which 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 fix the guide profiles 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.499
 now we take the measurement from the side wall to position the compartment 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.319
 door 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.420
 that is the position that the width of the space 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.359
 at this point the measurement is shown on the profile 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.889
 which is a guide profile 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.780
 the guide profiles are those uhm profiles 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 which are placed on the floor and ceiling 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.379
 the aci upright profiles are instead positioned vertically 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.729
 then proceed with cutting using an electric shear 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.379
 on the wings of the guide details are executed to be able to later 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.759
 to fold 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:15.709
 italy it's on 45 degrees to be able to fold profile and then make one 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.379
 sort of keandra corner box the door jamb 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.169
 once the profile is folded 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.169
 it is positioned 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.069
 before proceeding with the mechanical fixing of the guide profiles it is 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.299
 necessary to apply the tape of insulating gaskets make of guided 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.479
 floor 15 under the same profile 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.840
 the insulating gasket tape 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.739
 but chosen according to the width of the profile used 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.810
 and serves to prevent noise from being transmitted below the guide but 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.449
 also 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.009
 to prevent vibration of the building structure 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.009
 they affect the plastered wall 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.449
 then proceed with inserting the dowels 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.200
 which serve to mechanically fix liquid 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
 yes to the floor creates attic 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:20.469
 the blocks are positioned every 50 centimeters 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:24.999
 the choice of the type of baaria dowel according to the floor 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.740
 in the next phase it is presera sura of the height of the wall 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.069
 according to which 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.499
 the aci upright profiles will then be cut 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.430
 to be positioned vertically 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.689
 on the measure has surplus 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.559
 then comes metal profile cutters 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.830
 shorter big one centimeter 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.939
 respect the measure weighs 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.259
 this is necessary to facilitate the insertion of the arch profiles 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.870
 inside the afcebook guides 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.810
 also on the metal profiles that must be laid vertically 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.900
 the two perimeter walls it is necessary to apply the strip of gaskets 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.839
 insulating 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.789
 as previously done 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.599
 for guides out 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.979
 it will therefore be necessary to fix the aforementioned profiles with suitable plugs 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.979
 placed at 80 centimeters wheelbase 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.439
 for the uprights that must be positioned at the door it is necessary 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.449
 the immoral text joomola bed insertion text is then blocked with 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.509
 of the screws inside the profile ac 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.120
 the arch profile is positioned inside the adult guides with a 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.150
 rotation movement 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.880
 therefore blocked the use of a special punching machine only at the end 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.449
 lower 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.340
 with the aid of a magnetic level the verticality of the profile is verified 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.099
 B.C 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.610
 which will therefore also be blocked to the upper guide profile 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.280
 we proceed later 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.480
 to the positioning where's many aci upright profiles are marked the ground the 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.979
 measurement of the center distance of the profiles usually at 60 centimeters 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.629
 but that can be reduced to 30 or 40 centimeters depending on the needs 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.839
 the profiles are positioned on the previously marked marks 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.389
 checking its verticality 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.940
 and then fixing them with the punching machine as previously indicated 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.289
 at this point the width of the force is measured 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.610
 which will be shown on the metal guide profile to make the lintel 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.499
 with manual shears 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.499
 a 45 degree cut is made 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:12.059
 to bend the profile 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:16.210
 which is screwed and mounted after leveling it up 

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:19.209
 indicated 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.319
 finally 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.870
 a portion of profile ac is inserted on the lintel 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:29.430
 always in correspondence with the signs reported above 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.189
 the fix trend is applied to the entire perimeter with the exception of the betrayal 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:43.349
 a tape - adhesive and half oily useful to avoid breaking the corners 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:44.219
 after grouting
