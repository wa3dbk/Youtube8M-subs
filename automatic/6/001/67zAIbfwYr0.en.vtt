00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
their messes up to enemy UAV so they

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.999 
their messes up to enemy UAV so they
don't<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.820> where<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.650> also<00:01:19.650> use

don't know where you are also use

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.420 
don't know where you are also use
orbital<00:01:20.610> care<00:01:20.820> package<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> because

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
orbital care package and that is because

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270 
orbital care package and that is because
i<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> lot<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.500> good<00:01:25.830> drops<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
i think in a lot of good drops out of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
i think in a lot of good drops out of
this<00:01:26.430> clutter<00:01:26.670> package<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this clutter package and then the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
this clutter package and then the
killstreaks<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
killstreaks that you do get out of the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
killstreaks that you do get out of the
care<00:01:29.850> package<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.360> come<00:01:30.689> upgraded<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
care package they come upgraded like I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.620 
care package they come upgraded like I
wouldn't<00:01:32.400> say<00:01:32.520> upgraded<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.450> with

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
wouldn't say upgraded but they come with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
wouldn't say upgraded but they come with
the<00:01:33.750> ad<00:01:33.930> Owens<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.680> killstreak<00:01:35.189> ran<00:01:35.880> the
