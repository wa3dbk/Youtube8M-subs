00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
areas of the screen to prevent access to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.660 
areas of the screen to prevent access to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
so the way we're gonna set that up is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.440 
so the way we're gonna set that up is
we're<00:00:14.490> actually<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.790> gonna<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.150> into<00:00:15.360> our

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
we're actually just gonna go into our

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.779 
we're actually just gonna go into our
settings<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.170> then<00:00:16.830> under<00:00:17.130> general<00:00:17.550> settings

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
settings and then under general settings

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.810 
settings and then under general settings
we're<00:00:18.359> gonna<00:00:18.449> go<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> our<00:00:19.640> accessibility<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
we're gonna go to our accessibility and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.000 
we're gonna go to our accessibility and
then<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.869> gonna<00:00:22.050> scroll<00:00:22.350> down<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.800> our

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
then we're gonna scroll down to our

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.019 
then we're gonna scroll down to our
guided<00:00:23.519> access<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.470> turn<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> on

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
guided access so if we turn that on

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.839 
guided access so if we turn that on
there's<00:00:27.029> an<00:00:27.240> option<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.869> set<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> passcode<00:00:28.849> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
there's an option to set a passcode so

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.030 
there's an option to set a passcode so
we'll<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.119> set<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.689> 1<00:00:30.929> 2<00:00:31.170> 3<00:00:31.199> 4

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
we'll just set that as 1 2 3 4

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.360 
we'll just set that as 1 2 3 4
I'm<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.489> put<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.000> 2<00:00:33.210> times<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.219> can

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I'm just put that in 2 times now we can

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.889 
I'm just put that in 2 times now we can
go<00:00:35.520> ahead<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.000> exit<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.690> and

go ahead and just exit from there and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.970 
go ahead and just exit from there and
we're<00:00:37.200> set<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.989> we<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.320> go<00:00:40.500> into<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
order to get into it that's not the case

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.470 
order to get into it that's not the case
it's<00:02:36.349> just<00:02:37.340> that's<00:02:37.849> just<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
it's just that's just one of the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.620 
it's just that's just one of the
features<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:40.220> guided<00:02:40.760> access<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:41.420> is

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
features of the guided access that is

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.050 
features of the guided access that is
problematic<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.549> have<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.760> few

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
problematic so we do have a few

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.910 
problematic so we do have a few
solutions<00:02:44.540> for<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.900> we<00:02:45.440> also<00:02:45.620> have

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
solutions for that we also have

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.710 
solutions for that we also have
enclosures<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.730> actually<00:02:47.060> will<00:02:47.180> cover<00:02:47.450> up

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
enclosures that actually will cover up

on<00:02:53.209> those<00:02:53.630> enclosures<00:02:54.200> just<00:02:54.500> go<00:02:54.620> ahead<00:02:54.709> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
on those enclosures just go ahead and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.280 
on those enclosures just go ahead and
