00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.889
 all right 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.760
 in car occasion a page of reference 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.770
 in the world of the sale of 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.660
 car could not miss a video 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.270
 practical where we indicate the tricks 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.310
 to buy a used car they say that the 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.080
 face is the mirror of the soul so what 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.390
 first is to see the appearance of the car in 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.400
 general a couple of scratches have them 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.020
 anyone but if he is very careless 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.119
 it can be a sign of its conservation 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.400
 as for the painting we will not tolerate 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.320
 significant rust marks us 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.329
 we will look at the drawing and wear of the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.399
 tires if the forwards are 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.440
 worn uneven may indicate failures 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.730
 in the direction or parallel the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.100
 suspensions we will check them 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.110
 pressing on the car and releasing and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.630
 at the most they should perform an oscillation 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.050
 and stop we will review all the pilots 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.760
 headlights and lights inside is very 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.950
 important the state of the upholstery and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.950
 seats because they are expensive to repair 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 we will check that insurance works 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.810
 central locking and windows 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.060
 we will open and close all the doors 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 looking for squeaks or that are 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 off-hook or with great care 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.149
 with the hood and the trunk have to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 close perfectly adjusted or 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.960
 you will notice that the car has suffered a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.520
 serious accident the trunk can be 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 indicative of what is intended 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.259
 the car from normal use to the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 transport of bricks we will look at 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 the state of the carpet in breaks and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.649
 physical remains in addition if the car bears 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 the spare wheel we'll look at the 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.240
 state of it and if it has all the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 regulatory tools if the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.890
 pedals are very worn is a sign of 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.619
 seniority and mileage if the steering wheel 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.959
 the brightness is also very important 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.220
 Clutch pedal if worn 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.140
 clutch may be damaged 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 we will check that all the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.929
 radio lights heating air 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 conditioned 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.179
 warning and so on we can not forget the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.490
 Safety belts must all 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.130
 slow down and pick up well and of course 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.369
 anchor I know perfectly that the engine is 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 very clean or very dirty is bad signal 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.990
 it is also important to look at the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.520
 block 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.950
 and that it has no welding or that it is 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.560
 repainted and an interesting fact are the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 nuts and screws if they are worn is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.890
 that have been used to open and close it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.510
 so it has been repaired we 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.239
 we will also fix that the battery and the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 radiator do not lose the liquid with the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.080
 stopped and started car we will check 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.150
 the address we will turn the steering wheel of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.620
 butt to the top we will notice that no 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.500
 sound too much when it reaches the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.390
 stops and move without slackness before 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.610
 of buying a car obviously 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.200
 we should try it we will look at the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.390
 manageability of the controls like 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.790
 address and gearbox everything should 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.370
 operate smoothly and easily we will drive 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140
 slowly on long gears dropping 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.510
 the revving engine and accelerating to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.620
 background to see if it recovers well once 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.080
 that has caught some speed 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.150
 we will release the accelerator 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.010
 notice if the engine holds well we 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.650
 we will fix in the direction it has to be 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.480
 stable and intuitive and being prepared 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.400
 to pick it up again we will release the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.769
 straight wheel to see if the car is 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.959
 diverts something that should not happen 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.940
 brakes are important but cheaper 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.370
 to repair what other things we will do 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.320
 intense braking from about 80 to 90 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.680
 kilometers per hour and we'll look at 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.180
 that the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.640
 do not slip between the pills 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.859
 we will stop completely and the pedal will not 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.569
 should sink more because it would be a sign of 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.519
 leak in the circuit after driving 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.590
 we will stop it and leave the engine in 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.629
 March can be interesting to place 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.489
 newspaper papers under the engine to 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.049
 discover oil leaks after two 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.329
 or three minutes with the engine spinning at 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.719
 idle we will approach to hear how 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.389
 turns if it does slow but firm round 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.609
 It is a very good sign if we notice increases in 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.349
 Very sudden or intermittent revolutions 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.780
 bad another very important thing is 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.000
 place us in the escape and in passing we will see 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.310
 if it is rusty or loose but eye not 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.200
 touch and we will ask the owner to 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.150
 say a couple of accelerators or three gives the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.700
 brutal clear we will look at the smoke that comes out 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.810
 for the escape if it is white or bluish very 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.569
 bad signal 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.549
 the engine burns water or oil and to go 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.319
 concluding we will point the number of 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.480
 chassis to go to companies 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.969
 specialized and check if the car 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.609
 is free of charges and remember that here 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.129
 in autocasion.com you can download by 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.599
 written all these indications we 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.599
 we see in the next practical video
