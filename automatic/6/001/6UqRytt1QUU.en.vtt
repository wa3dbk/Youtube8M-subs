balloon this is this is actually the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.800 
balloon this is this is actually the
balloon<00:00:29.010> let<00:00:29.460> me<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.060> zoom<00:00:30.090> into<00:00:30.599> it

balloon let me see if I can zoom into it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.180 
balloon let me see if I can zoom into it
real<00:00:31.109> close<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.030> y'all<00:00:33.239> better<00:00:33.450> look<00:00:34.190> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
real close to get y'all better look this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.810 
real close to get y'all better look this
is<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> blooms<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:37.550> let<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.640> try

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
is what the blooms look like let me try

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.209 
is what the blooms look like let me try
to<00:00:38.879> find<00:00:39.120> another<00:00:39.450> spot<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.899> has<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:43.219> right

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to find another spot that has more right

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
to find another spot that has more right
here<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.289> shot<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
here this if I can get a good shot of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.090 
here this if I can get a good shot of
this<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> spotty<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.890> today

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this it's kind of spotty out here today

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.119 
this it's kind of spotty out here today
so<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> blooms<00:00:52.079> look<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.590> my

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so this is what the blooms look like my

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
so this is what the blooms look like my
mother<00:00:53.309> bulbs<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:53.940> where<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.449> been

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
mother bulbs are where it's been

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
mother bulbs are where it's been
pollinated<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
pollinated it actually don't have a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
pollinated it actually don't have a
flower<00:00:56.969> that's<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.600> guess<00:00:57.890> what<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> flower

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
flower that's I guess what the flower

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.270 
flower that's I guess what the flower
looks<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.120> small<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.350> dry<00:01:01.590> here

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
looks like is these small one dry here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.560 
looks like is these small one dry here
in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> center<00:01:02.850> let<00:01:03.750> me<00:01:03.840> give<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> focus

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
in the center let me give it to focus

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.969 
in the center let me give it to focus
its<00:01:06.570> these<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:07.140> small<00:01:07.439> ones<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> then

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
its these actually small ones and then

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.560 
its these actually small ones and then
they'll<00:01:08.159> swell<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.850> these<00:01:09.030> bigger<00:01:09.270> ones

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
they'll swell up as these bigger ones

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
they'll swell up as these bigger ones
like<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.520> ripen<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
like this and then as they ripen as a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
like this and then as they ripen as a
seed<00:01:12.540> they'll<00:01:12.840> turn<00:01:13.020> black<00:01:13.400> blackish<00:01:14.400> purple

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
seed they'll turn black blackish purple

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.260 
seed they'll turn black blackish purple
as<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.270> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
as you can see with these right here and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
as you can see with these right here and
one<00:01:18.390> above<00:01:18.570> its<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.960> dying<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> one

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
one above its not dying and the one
below<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> done<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> can

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
below it is done and that's when you can

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
below it is done and that's when you can
collect<00:01:22.619> seeds<00:01:23.600> there's<00:01:24.600> actually<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> lot<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
collect seeds there's actually a lot of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
collect seeds there's actually a lot of
seeds<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.860> yeah<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> looks<00:01:27.479> like

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
seeds on this yeah it kind of looks like

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.890 
seeds on this yeah it kind of looks like
it<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.020> lobes<00:01:29.000> like<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.720> than

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
it has lobes like it would be more than

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.289 
it has lobes like it would be more than
one<00:01:31.110> seed<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.250> there's<00:01:33.090> actually

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
one seed but it's not there's actually

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.010 
one seed but it's not there's actually
just<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.780> seed<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:35.119> see<00:01:36.119> how<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> has

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just one seed in there see how it has

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.499 
just one seed in there see how it has
lobes<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:38.280> there's<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.670> seed<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> center

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
lobes but there's one seed in the center

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
lobes but there's one seed in the center
when<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> turns<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.650> darker<00:01:41.070> color<00:01:41.100> they're

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
when it turns that darker color they're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
when it turns that darker color they're
done<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.070> harvest<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> there's<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
done and you can harvest and there's a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.010 
done and you can harvest and there's a
good<00:01:44.909> example<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.420> there

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
good example right there

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
good example right there
so<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> top<00:01:47.159> ones<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:47.880> just

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
so you have the top ones that are just

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
so you have the top ones that are just
now<00:01:48.540> coming<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
now coming out and then you have the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950 
now coming out and then you have the
ones<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.460> underneath<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.329> are

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
ones right underneath it that are

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
ones right underneath it that are
actually<00:01:52.439> pollinated<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.299> ones

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
actually pollinated and then the ones

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
actually pollinated and then the ones
that<00:01:54.750> aren't<00:01:54.899> done<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.979> pick<00:01:56.189> them

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that aren't done and you can pick them

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.090 
that aren't done and you can pick them
it's<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> small<00:01:58.200> berry<00:01:58.740> it's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's kind of like a small berry it's

anything see how big the normal leaves

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.560 
anything see how big the normal leaves
are<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.260> mean<00:02:31.860> they're<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.610> get<00:02:32.760> huge<00:02:33.240> I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
actually letting these go to seed and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.060 
actually letting these go to seed and
then<00:02:38.580> some<00:02:38.850> more<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.330> sprouted<00:02:40.070> these

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
then some more down here sprouted these

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.620 
then some more down here sprouted these
are<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> true<00:02:41.610> leaves<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.120> first<00:02:42.330> ones<00:02:42.540> that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
are the true leaves the first ones that

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.530 
are the true leaves the first ones that
come<00:02:42.810> out<00:02:42.930> they<00:02:43.500> get<00:02:43.710> really<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.220> big

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
come out they get really really big

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.610 
come out they get really really big
these<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.810> growing<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.290> small

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
these are just growing in small

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.500 
these are just growing in small
containers<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.460> stuff<00:02:47.670> grows<00:02:47.820> very<00:02:48.270> very

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
containers so this stuff grows very very
