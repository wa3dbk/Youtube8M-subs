00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
yourself or not so I was racking my

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.109 
yourself or not so I was racking my
brain<00:00:29.010> trying<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.400> come<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.820> few

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
brain trying to come up with a few

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
brain trying to come up with a few
negatives<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.170> guy<00:00:31.289> because

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
negatives to go with this guy because

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.049 
negatives to go with this guy because
you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> guess<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.399> gonna<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.669> mostly

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you can guess that it's gonna be mostly

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:33.889 
you can guess that it's gonna be mostly
pretty<00:00:33.239> positive

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
pretty positive

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
pretty positive
I<00:00:34.050> suppose<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I suppose the first one would be is that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.549 
I suppose the first one would be is that
he<00:00:36.180> doesn't<00:00:36.480> come<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.719> any<00:00:36.750> weapons<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
he doesn't come with any weapons and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.660 
he doesn't come with any weapons and
I'll<00:00:37.649> you'll<00:00:37.860> notice<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> lot<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.520> these

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
I'll you'll notice that a lot of these

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
I'll you'll notice that a lot of these
negatives<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.210> both<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.540> mobile<00:00:39.809> suit<00:00:40.050> design

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
negatives are both on mobile suit design

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.560 
negatives are both on mobile suit design
not<00:00:40.620> necessarily<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> model<00:00:41.610> however<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
not necessarily the model however you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.880 
not necessarily the model however you
have<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> wonder<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.290> no<00:00:43.500> weapons

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
have to wonder that with no weapons

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
have to wonder that with no weapons
that's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.190> lot<00:00:44.340> less<00:00:44.520> plastic<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.239> could

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
that's a lot less plastic and that could

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.119 
that's a lot less plastic and that could
that<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.930> result<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.559> slightly<00:00:46.829> lower

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that not result in a slightly lower

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
that not result in a slightly lower
price<00:00:47.250> than<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> age<00:00:48.090> run<00:00:48.390> normal<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:49.170> course

similar to the shoulders the way when
you<00:01:26.939> open<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> shoulders<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.840> look<00:01:28.049> like

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you open up the shoulders they look like

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.270 
you open up the shoulders they look like
they're<00:01:28.380> meant<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.650> open<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
they're meant to be open and it's the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
they're meant to be open and it's the
same<00:01:29.460> thing<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> wrists<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> take

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
same thing with the wrists when you take

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.719 
same thing with the wrists when you take
off<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.140> red<00:01:31.380> part<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
off this red part down there and I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.740 
off this red part down there and I
wonder<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.210> couldn't<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.540> done<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
wonder if they couldn't have done a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
wonder if they couldn't have done a
better<00:01:33.840> job<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.439> extending<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> because

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
better job of extending that because

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.800 
better job of extending that because
then<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.610> could<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.820> had<00:01:35.939> an<00:01:36.060> old<00:01:36.240> extendo

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
then you could have had an old extendo

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.319 
then you could have had an old extendo
mr.<00:01:37.140> fantastic<00:01:37.740> fist<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.790> wonder<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
mr. fantastic fist and I wonder if that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.300 
mr. fantastic fist and I wonder if that
would<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.810> added<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.110> another<00:01:40.590> dynamic<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
would have added just another dynamic to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
would have added just another dynamic to
this<00:01:41.820> kit<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.659> wonder<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.140> something

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this kit and I wonder if it's something

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.980 
this kit and I wonder if it's something
that<00:01:43.439> we'll<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> Master<00:01:44.549> Grade<00:01:44.990> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that we'll see with the Master Grade the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.330 
that we'll see with the Master Grade the
final<00:01:46.290> thing<00:01:46.470> being<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> were<00:01:47.220> going

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
final thing being that if you were going

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
final thing being that if you were going
to<00:01:47.399> change<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> head<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> chest<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to change the head in the chest the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
to change the head in the chest the
chest<00:01:49.079> has<00:01:49.500> changed<00:01:49.829> ever<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.280> slightly<00:01:50.549> by

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
chest has changed ever so slightly by

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.429 
chest has changed ever so slightly by
adding<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.180> red<00:01:51.360> shoulders<00:01:51.720> could<00:01:52.320> they

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
adding in the red shoulders could they

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.870 
adding in the red shoulders could they
not<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.619> made<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> tiny<00:01:53.100> variation<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
not have made a tiny variation in the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
not have made a tiny variation in the
head<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> wondered<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.540> gray<00:01:54.869> part<00:01:55.140> could

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
head I wondered if that gray part could

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
head I wondered if that gray part could
have<00:01:55.350> been<00:01:55.439> replaced<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> red<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.280> but

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
have been replaced with a red one but

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.819 
have been replaced with a red one but
hey<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.479> me<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.740> I'm

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
hey that's just me and you know that I'm

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
hey that's just me and you know that I'm
reaching<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.520> most<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> these<00:01:59.939> negatives<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
reaching for most of these negatives and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.899 
reaching for most of these negatives and
probably<00:02:01.200> most<00:02:01.860> people<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> very

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
probably most people would have a very

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.170 
probably most people would have a very
different<00:02:03.270> take<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:04.729> in<00:02:05.729> terms<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
different take on them in terms of the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.520 
different take on them in terms of the
positives<00:02:06.600> though<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> say<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
positives though I have to say that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.080 
positives though I have to say that
there<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.039> many<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.789> pretty<00:02:08.970> much

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
there are so many and I'm pretty much

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.580 
there are so many and I'm pretty much
going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.479> through<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:10.170> start<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
going to go through this from start to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.000 
going to go through this from start to
finish<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.849> best<00:02:11.879> part<00:02:12.239> being<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.690> me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
finish the best part being for me

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.619 
finish the best part being for me
that<00:02:13.099> it<00:02:13.189> wasn't<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.640> repetitive<00:02:13.939> build<00:02:14.360> I

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
that it wasn't a repetitive build I

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.210 
that it wasn't a repetitive build I
figured<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.230> whole<00:02:15.409> wear<00:02:15.650> system<00:02:16.069> that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
figured with this whole wear system that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.490 
figured with this whole wear system that
if<00:02:16.310> you're<00:02:16.489> building<00:02:16.790> three<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.290> little

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
if you're building three it's a little

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.660 
if you're building three it's a little
bit<00:02:18.590> different<00:02:18.799> from<00:02:19.010> having<00:02:19.370> three

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
bit different from having three

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.860 
bit different from having three
different<00:02:19.790> strike<00:02:20.239> Gundams<00:02:20.599> where<00:02:20.750> you're

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
different strike Gundams where you're

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.330 
different strike Gundams where you're
just<00:02:21.019> swapping<00:02:21.260> off<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> strike<00:02:21.829> packs<00:02:22.099> or

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
just swapping off the strike packs or

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.740 
just swapping off the strike packs or
four<00:02:22.549> symbols<00:02:22.909> where<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.239> at<00:02:23.390> least<00:02:23.540> got<00:02:23.720> a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
four symbols where you at least got a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.869 
four symbols where you at least got a
color<00:02:23.989> variation<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.519> aged<00:02:25.640> ones

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
color variation but with the aged ones

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.190 
color variation but with the aged ones
you've<00:02:26.030> got<00:02:26.180> totally<00:02:26.510> different<00:02:26.810> limbs<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
you've got totally different limbs but I

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.410 
you've got totally different limbs but I
wondered<00:02:27.560> would<00:02:27.769> that<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.099> enough<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.640> having

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
wondered would that be enough and having

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.970 
wondered would that be enough and having
done<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.870> high<00:02:30.019> grades<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> advanced

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
done the high grades and the advanced

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.770 
done the high grades and the advanced
grades<00:02:31.280> now<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.940> say<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.329> certainty<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
grades now I can say with certainty that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.110 
grades now I can say with certainty that
the<00:02:33.079> there's<00:02:33.500> plenty<00:02:33.829> of<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.849> only<00:02:34.879> part

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the there's plenty of this the only part

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.490 
the there's plenty of this the only part
that's<00:02:35.360> gonna<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.629> repetitive<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.260> chest

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
that's gonna be repetitive is the chest

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.020 
that's gonna be repetitive is the chest
in<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.650> head<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.069> even<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:37.459> take<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> time

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
in the head and even they take the time

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.880 
in the head and even they take the time
to<00:02:38.269> make<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.569> chest<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:39.379> those<00:02:39.650> red

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
to make the chest have those red

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.559 
to make the chest have those red
shoulders<00:02:40.310> everything<00:02:40.819> about<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.180> was<00:02:41.329> just

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
shoulders everything about that was just

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.599 
shoulders everything about that was just
great<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.230> when<00:02:42.829> you<00:02:42.920> combine<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> fact<00:02:43.489> that

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
great and when you combine the fact that

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.830 
great and when you combine the fact that
you're<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:43.939> be<00:02:44.030> getting<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.299> whole<00:02:44.540> bunch

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
you're going to be getting a whole bunch

of effect parts I'm talking fourteen of
these<00:02:47.180> little<00:02:47.390> parts<00:02:47.629> here<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.530> combine<00:02:48.829> with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
these little parts here to combine with

these little parts here to combine with
the<00:02:49.069> two<00:02:49.220> parts<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.640> go<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:49.970> lariat<00:02:50.359> they

look good they work good they could have

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.800 
look good they work good they could have
cheaped<00:02:52.700> out<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.150> given<00:02:53.389> you<00:02:53.480> four<00:02:53.780> and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
you could have putted them in one

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.069 
you could have putted them in one
shoulder<00:02:55.370> or<00:02:55.549> one<00:02:55.819> knee<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.180> time<00:02:56.389> but

the poseability of this kit is great
it's<00:03:36.470> interesting<00:03:36.949> to<00:03:37.280> see<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.489> totally<00:03:38.030> unique

it's interesting to see a totally unique

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.240 
it's interesting to see a totally unique
ankle<00:03:38.810> design<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.260> double-o<00:03:39.680> one<00:03:39.889> has<00:03:40.040> done<00:03:40.190> a

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
ankle design the double-o one has done a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.250 
ankle design the double-o one has done a
good<00:03:40.430> job<00:03:40.489> with<00:03:40.730> its<00:03:41.120> ability<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.049> put<00:03:42.199> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
good job with its ability to put the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.569 
good job with its ability to put the
legs<00:03:42.440> all<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.650> way<00:03:42.769> out<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:42.980> Bend<00:03:43.310> all<00:03:43.459> the

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
legs all the way out and Bend all the

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.369 
legs all the way out and Bend all the
way<00:03:43.669> down<00:03:43.879> this<00:03:44.510> one's<00:03:44.810> got<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:44.989> totally

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
way down this one's got a totally

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.720 
way down this one's got a totally
different<00:03:45.680> take<00:03:45.829> on<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.250> think<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.549> it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
different take on it and I think that it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.939 
different take on it and I think that it
works<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.090> fine<00:03:47.389> the<00:03:48.199> knee<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.590> especially

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
works just fine the knee is especially

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.470 
works just fine the knee is especially
great<00:03:49.370> because<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.849> get<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.000> put<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.329> red

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
great because you get to put the red

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.849 
great because you get to put the red
part<00:03:50.720> on<00:03:50.810> top<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.169> the<00:03:51.230> gray<00:03:51.379> which<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.590> gonna

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
part on top of the gray which is gonna

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.009 
part on top of the gray which is gonna
reveal<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.250> bunch<00:03:52.519> of<00:03:52.639> both<00:03:52.790> colors<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.480> when

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
reveal a bunch of both colors and when

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.420 
reveal a bunch of both colors and when
you<00:03:54.109> bend<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.500> still<00:03:54.739> stays<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.220> middle

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
you bend it it still stays in the middle

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.039 
you bend it it still stays in the middle
and<00:03:55.579> look<00:03:55.699> sharp<00:03:56.000> combine<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.810> with<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
and look sharp combine that with the

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.420 
and look sharp combine that with the
fact<00:03:57.169> that<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.470> can<00:03:57.620> move<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.859> hips<00:03:58.069> anywhere

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
fact that you can move the hips anywhere

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.430 
fact that you can move the hips anywhere
the<00:03:58.549> waist<00:03:58.730> anywhere<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.629> most<00:03:59.870> importantly

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
the waist anywhere but most importantly

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.500 
the waist anywhere but most importantly
yes<00:04:00.769> it's<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.220> shoulders<00:04:01.699> by<00:04:01.940> having<00:04:02.389> this

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
yes it's the shoulders by having this

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.020 
yes it's the shoulders by having this
big<00:04:02.840> rotating<00:04:03.440> point<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.400> fact<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.699> you<00:04:04.879> can

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
shoulders I think that's great

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.270

selling<00:04:25.730> feature<00:04:25.910> when<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.330> looked<00:04:26.600> at<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.780> box

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
selling feature when I looked at the box

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.660 
selling feature when I looked at the box
again<00:04:27.260> yes<00:04:27.500> there<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> picture<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.340> where<00:04:28.550> it

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
again yes there is a picture to where it

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.700 
again yes there is a picture to where it
is<00:04:28.790> opened<00:04:29.240> up<00:04:29.360> doesn't<00:04:30.230> show<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.410> how<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.590> do

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
is opened up doesn't show you how to do

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.050 
is opened up doesn't show you how to do
it<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.950> manual<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.460> you'd<00:04:31.580> have<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.760> figure

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
it in the manual so you'd have to figure

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.310 
it in the manual so you'd have to figure
it<00:04:32.150> out<00:04:32.270> yourself<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.840> hope<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.170> there's

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
it out yourself so I hope that there's

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.830 
it out yourself so I hope that there's
nobody<00:04:33.590> who's<00:04:33.740> missing<00:04:34.160> out<00:04:34.370> on<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:35.060> yes

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
nobody who's missing out on that and yes

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.540 
nobody who's missing out on that and yes
overall<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.680> looks<00:04:36.950> look<00:04:37.220> good<00:04:37.400> the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
overall the looks look good the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.460 
overall the looks look good the
poseability<00:04:37.940> looks<00:04:38.360> good<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.810> all<00:04:39.290> that

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
poseability looks good and all that

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.550 
poseability looks good and all that
matters<00:04:39.800> then<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.490> final<00:04:40.820> verdict<00:04:41.560> which

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
matters then is the final verdict which

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.630 
matters then is the final verdict which
you<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.920> guess<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.310> going<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.550> be

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
you can guess is going to be

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.880 
you can guess is going to be
overwhelmingly<00:04:44.570> positive<00:04:45.050> based<00:04:45.620> on<00:04:45.800> the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.280 
anything too new to the table but the
tightest<00:05:29.390> by<00:05:29.510> bringing<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.870> strong<00:05:30.110> man

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
tightest by bringing the strong man

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.650

aspect<00:05:30.740> in<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.100> pulling<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:31.970> off<00:05:32.090> so<00:05:32.390> well<00:05:32.630> I

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
aspect in and pulling it off so well I

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.600 
aspect in and pulling it off so well I

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
think is just fantastic and if high

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.760 
think is just fantastic and if high
grades<00:05:34.880> continue<00:05:35.330> going<00:05:35.480> in<00:05:35.690> this<00:05:35.810> way<00:05:36.020> you

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
grades continue going in this way you

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.980 
grades continue going in this way you
don't<00:05:37.010> really<00:05:37.190> need<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.460> 1/100<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.450> make<00:05:38.600> up<00:05:38.780> for

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
don't really need a 1/100 to make up for

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.810 
don't really need a 1/100 to make up for
the<00:05:39.050> high<00:05:39.200> grades<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:40.100> things<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.580> lacks

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
the high grades the things that it lacks

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.760 
the high grades the things that it lacks
and<00:05:41.180> in<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:41.900> case<00:05:42.140> we're<00:05:42.320> gonna<00:05:42.410> go<00:05:42.590> straight
