 Microsoft who fought for a bigger slice 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.990
 in the mobile and tablet market 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.900
 focusing on its new operating system 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.060

 windows phone 8 release the Lord

 mobile system is the only one that puts the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.560
 people first 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.600
 the start screen of the system filled with 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.180
 small squares with information on

 featured actress jessica alba 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.190
 system has been criticized more than 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 we can not make any decisions yet 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.090
 long-term 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 some IDC analysts said that the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 number of phones with windows phone 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 can reach 21 points 2 million in this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.930
 year with a growth estimate 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.340
 to 179 points 1 million by the end of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.230
 2016 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 believes that it is too early to 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 to judge the success of mobile phones 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.890
 windows 8 but the company increased its 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.100
 reputation becoming a competitor 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.590
 direct with apple and google still in this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 microsoft presented a portion of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.049
 tablets created by Asian companies 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.240
 all running windows 8 after 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.479
 company announced its own tablet the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.939
 simple rt 100 of the product designed by 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.799
 Microsoft's own relations with 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.180
 other companies that produce integrates 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.829
 was compromised 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.500
 even if the appliance has not been 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.600
 exactly a sales success 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
 windows 8 was released in October 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.810
 year and became the largest update 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 made by the company in its system 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.369
 leaving many consumers 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.619
 confused in relation to the two types of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.479
 windows 1 for tablets based on 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.850
 intel architecture and another to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.500
 tablets based on architecture arm 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.299
 the second does not work as a system 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.369
 operating system for desktops 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.920
 soon all your applications should be 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.259
 purchased in the windows store and for the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.170
 microsoft has updated the old 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.420
 office for the office 365 carrying 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.580
 all your cloud content is one more 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.739
 very important step for growth. 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.200
 in the corporate market where the company 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.810
 compete with google 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 and surprising some steven sinofsky 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 director responsible for windows left 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.709
 the company at the end of this year, 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.470
 it seems there was a tension between him and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.360
 other company executives and this was 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.370
