00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.410 
well so I know this guy's gonna be
rotating<00:01:55.040> from<00:01:55.159> B<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.610> I'm<00:01:55.880> just<00:01:56.090> gonna<00:01:56.180> try

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
rotating from B and I'm just gonna try

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.780 
rotating from B and I'm just gonna try
and<00:01:56.450> time<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:56.960> flash<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.710> be<00:01:58.040> when<00:01:58.340> he<00:01:58.370> Peaks

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
and time this flash to be when he Peaks

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.770 
and time this flash to be when he Peaks
spawn<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.590> throw<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.979> walk<00:02:01.430> out<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.780> changed

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
spawn and throw it I walk out I changed

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.460 
spawn and throw it I walk out I changed
my<00:02:02.930> spot<00:02:03.200> basically<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.930> this<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
my spot basically and this is not the

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.199 
my spot basically and this is not the
best<00:02:06.680> spot<00:02:06.950> for<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.280> kind<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.490> situation<00:02:07.610> but

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
best spot for this kind of situation but

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.029 
best spot for this kind of situation but
it's<00:02:08.330> good<00:02:08.539> enough<00:02:08.569> as<00:02:09.019> he<00:02:09.289> there's<00:02:09.590> tons<00:02:09.920> of

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
it's good enough as he there's tons of

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.080 
it's good enough as he there's tons of
places<00:02:10.159> that<00:02:10.369> he<00:02:10.489> thinks<00:02:10.700> I'm<00:02:10.789> gonna<00:02:10.909> run

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
places that he thinks I'm gonna run

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.440 
places that he thinks I'm gonna run
probably<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> banana<00:02:11.659> or<00:02:11.840> door<00:02:11.959> or<00:02:11.989> something

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
probably the banana or door or something

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
probably the banana or door or something
and<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:12.930> exactly<00:02:13.080> what<00:02:13.470> he<00:02:13.560> thought<00:02:13.709> he

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and that's exactly what he thought he

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
and that's exactly what he thought he
thought<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> ran<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> door<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.790> near<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.450> door

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
thought I ran to door or near the door

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.720 
thought I ran to door or near the door
and<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.739> was<00:02:17.099> able<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.280> shoot<00:02:17.430> him<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.670> back

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and I was able to shoot him in the back

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.790 
and I was able to shoot him in the back
so<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.660> were<00:02:18.780> two<00:02:18.959> key<00:02:19.200> reasons<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> why

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
so there were two key reasons as to why

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.650 
so there were two key reasons as to why
I<00:02:19.920> won<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.310> round<00:02:20.459> first<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:20.970> all<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.450> was

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
I won that round first of all it was

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.720 
I won that round first of all it was
that<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.380> was<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> five<00:02:22.860> versus<00:02:23.160> one<00:02:23.370> they

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that I was in a five versus one they

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.040 
that I was in a five versus one they
thought<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.150> gonna<00:02:24.270> be<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.690> know<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.930> end

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
thought it was gonna be you know the end

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.420 
thought it was gonna be you know the end
of<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> round<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.500> kill<00:02:25.650> me<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.160> biggest

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
of the round just kill me the biggest

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.000 
of the round just kill me the biggest
thing<00:02:26.790> was<00:02:27.090> them<00:02:27.480> peeking<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:28.440> by<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.830> by<00:02:28.980> one

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
thing was them peeking one by one by one

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.440 
thing was them peeking one by one by one
admit<00:02:29.489> if<00:02:29.610> they<00:02:29.730> would<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:29.970> stood

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
admit if they would have just stood

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.970 
admit if they would have just stood
still<00:02:30.810> instead<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.230> strafing<00:02:31.500> out<00:02:31.770> and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
still instead of strafing out and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.780 
still instead of strafing out and
shooting<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.310> mean<00:02:32.459> they<00:02:32.550> would<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.700> just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
shooting I mean they would have just

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.340 
shooting I mean they would have just
killed<00:02:33.090> me<00:02:33.270> because<00:02:33.840> two<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.110> them<00:02:34.230> would<00:02:34.290> have

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
killed me because two of them would have

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.840 
killed me because two of them would have
been<00:02:34.440> shooting<00:02:34.739> me<00:02:34.830> at<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> same<00:02:35.130> time<00:02:35.370> more

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
been shooting me at the same time more

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.920 
been shooting me at the same time more
than<00:02:35.970> likely<00:02:36.120> would<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.420> had<00:02:36.569> shot<00:02:36.750> at<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:36.900> I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
than likely would have had shot at me I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.910 
than likely would have had shot at me I
didn't<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.230> head<00:02:37.410> armor<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.739> they<00:02:37.800> would

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
didn't have head armor and they would

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.210 
didn't have head armor and they would
have<00:02:38.010> killed<00:02:38.100> me<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.170> other<00:02:40.319> thing<00:02:40.620> was

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
have killed me and the other thing was

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.280 
have killed me and the other thing was
that<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.150> able<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.630> three<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.170> them

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that I was able to get three of them

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
that I was able to get three of them
within<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:44.069> five<00:02:44.459> seconds<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> each<00:02:45.090> other

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
within like five seconds of each other

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.520 
within like five seconds of each other
that's<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.230> when<00:02:46.410> you're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that's what you have to do when you're

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.809 
that's what you have to do when you're
in<00:02:46.620> an<00:02:46.709> eco<00:02:47.040> round<00:02:47.250> or<00:02:47.400> something<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.760> you

not you don't have like the best

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.500 
not you don't have like the best
positioning<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.030> they<00:02:51.090> don't<00:02:51.299> they<00:02:51.480> don't

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
positioning and they don't they don't

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
positioning and they don't they don't
know<00:02:51.810> where<00:02:51.959> you're<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.950> just
