little loop that will come on up just a

little loop that will come on up just a

here<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.699> lowest<00:00:26.939> point<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
here the the lowest point on the

here the the lowest point on the
competitive<00:00:28.500> loop<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.070> 1,100<00:00:29.670> feet<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.090> a

competitive loop is at 1,100 feet and a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.049 
competitive loop is at 1,100 feet and a
thousand<00:00:30.779> feet<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.650> good<00:00:32.130> breakpoint

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
thousand feet is a good breakpoint

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.760 
thousand feet is a good breakpoint
because<00:00:33.450> I'll<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> low<00:00:34.290> end<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.649> my

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
because I'll see at the low end of my

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
because I'll see at the low end of my
property<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.960> 960<00:00:36.960> feet<00:00:38.239> softer

conditions<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.770> higher<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:42.469> we've<00:00:43.469> just

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
conditions then up higher so we've just

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.180 
conditions then up higher so we've just
walked<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.370> terrain<00:00:44.730> where<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:46.010> trails<00:00:47.010> will

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
walked the terrain where the trails will

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.510 
walked the terrain where the trails will
be<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> ski<00:00:47.700> trails<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.629> awesome

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.069 
trail around that side of the stadium
area<00:02:46.500> comes<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.450> little

Ridge that we're standing on makes

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.400 
Ridge that we're standing on makes
another<00:02:50.489> loop<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> comes<00:02:51.900> back<00:02:51.989> down

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
another loop and then it comes back down

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.640 
another loop and then it comes back down
into<00:02:52.709> our<00:02:53.450> over<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.600> little<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.590> little

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
along the edge of this Ridge and kind of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.790 
along the edge of this Ridge and kind of
meander<00:03:24.450> through<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> trees<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.410> way<00:03:25.590> and

head back up into the parking area and
as<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.000> can<00:03:30.150> see<00:03:30.330> there's<00:03:30.650> nice<00:03:31.650> views<00:03:31.980> here

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
as you can see there's nice views here

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.890 
as you can see there's nice views here
of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:34.610> Pioneer<00:03:35.610> Ridge<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.330> Knik<00:03:36.780> glacier

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
of the Pioneer Ridge and Knik glacier

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.800 
of the Pioneer Ridge and Knik glacier
and<00:03:37.610> it's<00:03:38.610> especially<00:03:38.850> open<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and it's especially open in the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.650 
and it's especially open in the
wintertime<00:03:40.319> when<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.830> leaves<00:03:41.010> come<00:03:41.220> off<00:03:41.660> so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
wintertime when the leaves come off so

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.900 
wintertime when the leaves come off so
we're<00:03:42.870> really<00:03:43.680> looking<00:03:43.890> forward<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.310> skiing

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
we're really looking forward to skiing

00:03:44.910 --> 00:04:03.270 
we're really looking forward to skiing
this<00:03:45.090> trail<00:03:45.500> next<00:03:46.500> winter

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.440 

it's<00:04:04.280> great<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.519> think<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.819> project<00:04:05.030> turned

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
it's great I think the project turned

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.280 
it's great I think the project turned
out<00:04:05.599> a<00:04:05.629> lot<00:04:06.170> better<00:04:06.409> than<00:04:06.500> we<00:04:06.769> had<00:04:06.920> anticipated

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.280 

working<00:04:10.159> hand-in-hand<00:04:10.489> with<00:04:11.140> people<00:04:12.140> from

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
working hand-in-hand with people from

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.890 
working hand-in-hand with people from
the<00:04:12.440> borough<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:13.370> little<00:04:14.299> guidance<00:04:14.599> I<00:04:14.750> mean

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
the borough and a little guidance I mean

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.449 
the borough and a little guidance I mean
I<00:04:14.989> think<00:04:15.379> actually<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.830> turned<00:04:16.040> out<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.430> a

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
I think actually is turned out to be a

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.810 
I think actually is turned out to be a
very<00:04:17.150> nice<00:04:17.389> very<00:04:17.870> nice<00:04:18.109> project<00:04:21.820> initially

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
very nice very nice project initially

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.879 
very nice very nice project initially
when<00:04:23.060> we<00:04:23.750> were<00:04:23.870> looking<00:04:24.139> over<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.500> area<00:04:24.800> just

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
when we were looking over the area just

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.280 
when we were looking over the area just
walking<00:04:25.310> around<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.729> trying<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:26.139> we<00:04:27.139> didn't

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
walking around and trying to we didn't

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.629 
walking around and trying to we didn't
never<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.500> get<00:04:27.650> base<00:04:27.800> napping<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.370> had<00:04:28.520> to

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
never I get base napping so I had to

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.219 
never I get base napping so I had to
pretty<00:04:28.820> much<00:04:28.940> just<00:04:29.240> ground<00:04:29.720> true<00:04:29.900> sit<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.169> I

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
pretty much just ground true sit and I

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.860 
pretty much just ground true sit and I
walked<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.740> area<00:04:30.979> quite<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.220> bit<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.810> when<00:04:32.810> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
walked the area quite a bit and when the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.409 
walked the area quite a bit and when the
GPS<00:04:33.220> found<00:04:34.220> all<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.520> really<00:04:34.970> unique<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
GPS found all the really unique the

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.210 
GPS found all the really unique the
locations<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.289> little<00:04:36.500> stream<00:04:36.680> crossings

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
locations the little stream crossings

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.129 
locations the little stream crossings
and<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> ridge<00:04:37.699> tops<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.270> views<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.539> I

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
and the ridge tops and the views that I

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.159 
and the ridge tops and the views that I
really<00:04:39.440> thought<00:04:40.220> were<00:04:40.370> spectacular<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.210> then

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
really thought were spectacular and then

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.840 
really thought were spectacular and then

the recreational venue that I put

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.689 
the recreational venue that I put
together<00:04:45.039> tried<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.130> connect<00:04:46.430> all<00:04:46.550> those

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
together tried to connect all those

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.210 
together tried to connect all those
points<00:04:47.060> together<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.510> a<00:04:47.539> trail<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.080> as<00:04:49.010> you

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
points together with a trail so as you

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.640 
points together with a trail so as you
around<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:49.850> trail<00:04:50.060> or<00:04:50.449> use<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.440> summer

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
around the trail or use it in the summer

time you'll find all these nice view

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:01.100 
time you'll find all these nice view
points

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.780 

there<00:05:02.040> is<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.670> think<00:05:02.700> 13<00:05:03.300> bridges<00:05:03.690> on<00:05:03.840> site<00:05:04.140> here

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
there is I think 13 bridges on site here

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.890 
there is I think 13 bridges on site here
there's<00:05:05.790> some<00:05:05.910> nice<00:05:06.030> vantage<00:05:06.510> points<00:05:06.780> has

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
there's some nice vantage points has

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.400 
there's some nice vantage points has
great<00:05:07.110> views<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.530> mountain<00:05:07.860> range<00:05:09.410> you've

got<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.620> beginner's<00:05:11.340> loop<00:05:11.550> an<00:05:11.760> intermediate

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
got a beginner's loop an intermediate

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.760 
got a beginner's loop an intermediate
loop<00:05:12.450> here<00:05:12.690> in<00:05:12.780> an<00:05:12.870> advanced<00:05:13.200> loop<00:05:13.440> for<00:05:13.680> the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
loop here in an advanced loop for the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.080 
loop here in an advanced loop for the
skiers<00:05:14.130> so<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.430> think<00:05:14.550> there's<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:14.850> little<00:05:14.970> bit

skiers so I think there's a little bit
for<00:05:15.330> everybody<00:05:15.750> we<00:05:16.680> built<00:05:16.950> some<00:05:17.100> world-class

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
for everybody we built some world-class

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.140 
for everybody we built some world-class
