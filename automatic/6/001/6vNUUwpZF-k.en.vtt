00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
average about 1.5 would fell out of the

average about 1.5 would fell out of the
four<00:01:03.120> boats<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:04.260> crew<00:01:04.530> wasn't<00:01:05.010> actually

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
four boats and my crew wasn't actually

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the best i could have which means that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.880 
the best i could have which means that
sometimes<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.490> focusing<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.450> resources<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
sometimes I was focusing on resources to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.899 
sometimes I was focusing on resources to
kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> keep<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.729> realistic

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
kind of keep it a bit more realistic

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.780 
kind of keep it a bit more realistic
than<00:01:12.330> normal<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> ended<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.130> after<00:01:14.400> one

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
than normal so I ended up after one

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.380 
than normal so I ended up after one
month<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.509> hundred<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.170> lacquer<00:01:17.390> 124

and 69 coy scales so kind of working

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
and 69 coy scales so kind of working
that<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.400> profit<00:01:30.119> wise<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.659> know<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that out now with profit wise you know I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
that out now with profit wise you know I
would<00:01:31.110> work<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.530> by<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:32.850> each<00:01:33.180> like

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
would work it out by how much each like

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.039 
would work it out by how much each like
lacquer<00:01:34.290> would<00:01:34.590> cost<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.060> 101<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
lacquer would cost so out of 101 you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
lacquer would cost so out of 101 you
could<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.470> maybe<00:01:37.850> three<00:01:38.850> helmets

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
could only make maybe three helmets

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
could only make maybe three helmets
because<00:01:39.829> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> would<00:01:41.130> end<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.400> with

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
because you know you would end up with

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
because you know you would end up with
11<00:01:42.000> spare<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.810> work<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.710> by<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> total

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
11 spare so I work it out by the total

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.359 
11 spare so I work it out by the total
of<00:01:44.790> 101<00:01:45.329> by<00:01:45.720> working<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:46.380> 40,000<00:01:47.189> each

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
of 101 by working out about 40,000 each

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.770 
of 101 by working out about 40,000 each
because<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:48.600> work

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
because that's how much you would work

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
because that's how much you would work
out<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.170> sold<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.040> helmet<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:51.119> much

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
out if you sold the helmet and how much

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
out if you sold the helmet and how much
you<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.450> work<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.200> /<00:01:52.380> lacquer<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you would work out you know / lacquer so

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.910 
you would work out you know / lacquer so
with<00:01:53.640> 101<00:01:54.090> lacquers<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:54.869> equate<00:01:55.649> about

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
with 101 lacquers it would equate about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.999 
with 101 lacquers it would equate about
4<00:01:56.130> million<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:57.240> 124<00:01:58.170> plate<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.740> would<00:01:58.829> be

I saw them pretty instantly and I worked
out<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:55.800> about<00:02:55.920> ten<00:02:56.400> point<00:02:56.670> six<00:02:56.790> million

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
out with about ten point six million

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.570 
out with about ten point six million
profit<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:58.110> still<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.370> bad

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
profit but still that is not that bad

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.090 
profit but still that is not that bad
for<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.390> month<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.560> know<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.890> one

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
for one month because I know that one

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.980 
for one month because I know that one
month<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.640> make<00:03:02.790> just<00:03:03.240> twelve<00:03:03.570> point<00:03:03.810> nine

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
month to make just twelve point nine

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.900 
month to make just twelve point nine
million<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> very<00:03:05.070> long<00:03:05.220> time<00:03:05.460> because<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
million is a very long time because that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.660 
million is a very long time because that
works<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.330> be<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:07.250> 150<00:03:08.250> million<00:03:08.430> per

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
works out to be like 150 million per

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.450 
works out to be like 150 million per
year<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.960> work<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.290> out<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.800> an<00:03:11.040> hourly

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
year but if you work it out on an hourly

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.980 
year but if you work it out on an hourly
rate<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.150> doing<00:03:12.300> five<00:03:12.600> minutes<00:03:12.870> per<00:03:12.960> day

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
rate you know doing five minutes per day

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.080 
rate you know doing five minutes per day
on<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.530> play<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:13.830> pause<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.580> 100%

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
on the play one pause and that's 100%

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.520 
on the play one pause and that's 100%
possible<00:03:15.660> by<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.840> way<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:16.320> do<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.470> in

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
possible by the way to just do it in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
possible by the way to just do it in
five<00:03:16.710> minutes<00:03:16.980> sometimes<00:03:17.820> even<00:03:17.970> took<00:03:18.180> me<00:03:18.330> like

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
five minutes sometimes even took me like

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.480 
five minutes sometimes even took me like
three<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.930> four<00:03:19.110> minutes<00:03:19.230> even<00:03:19.500> do<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.830> even

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
three to four minutes even do it even

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.820 
three to four minutes even do it even
shorter<00:03:20.670> but<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.720> work<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.990> out<00:03:22.110> by<00:03:22.440> five

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
shorter but if you work it out by five

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.830 
shorter but if you work it out by five
minutes<00:03:23.070> per<00:03:23.250> day<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:23.459> home<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.090> that's<00:03:24.570> two
