 with you online president shop 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.420
 watches and today we will tell about the clock 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.880
 casio prw 2501 not 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.230
 these watches are made in black color 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.080
 orange inscriptions on their buttons 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.650
 case and strap material 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 high quality polymer plastic 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750

 hour information 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.869
 tempered mineral glass protection against 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 scratch on this watch here 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 impermeability of 20 atmospheres in them is possible 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 dive time display method 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.450
 digital 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.649
 quartz movement work four from 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 solar batteries 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.899
 dimensions of the model length fifty six 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.300
 tenths of millimeters width fifty 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.079
 six and three tenths of millimeter thickness 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.719
 15 millimeters weight 80 point six 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.260
 tenth grant on the functions of this watch 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.820
 there is a backlight it is LED further 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 there is a compass on campus it has a factory 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.380
 calibration but also you can it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.409
 calibrate in two different ways 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.390
 this is a bidirectional calibration north 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.220
 calibration and also change the angle 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.299
 magnetic declination is necessary because 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.770
 that true north is different from 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.470
 magnetic north since earth 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 rotates in our video about tuning i 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.549
 telling and showing how to make 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 bidirectional calibration without 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.299
 any 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.750
 technical means additional in 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.570
 campus mode three wands indicates 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.420
 north rest south west east still in 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.320
 The mode still rotates in this clock 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.670
 the front of the clock that will allow you 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.460
 more convenient to use the compass 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.009
 make some small profit further 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.149
 hours there is a barometer a couple mode 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.649
 barometer you can see the pressure 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.340
 also pressure pressure chart 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.840
 displayed in hectare pascals either 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.239
 inches of mercury you can also 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.549
 it is to adjust the degrees 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.100
 topic 2 and this model has degrees 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.709
 either Celsius degrees are displayed 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.090
 either in hail shop in fahrenheit it too 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.970
 configurable both sensors are calibrated 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.290
 hours later there is an altimeter altimeter 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.100
 shows height 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.060
 either in meters or feet also altimeter 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.400
 calibrated 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.209
 and you can also take notes in a notebook 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.420
 book is useful for trekking 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.690
 white subway have a time setting for 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 measurements are either 1 2 minutes or 5 times 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.460
 seconds 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:51.610
 sensor so that is here further 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.340
 these hours have a useful feature for 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.270
 fishermen dream of any fisherman schedule 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.430
 ebb and flow 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.590
 as well as the moon phase indicator video about 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.910
 setting detail telling them 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.250
 tune calibrate next u clock 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.180
 there is a notebook mode here you are 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.560
 can view records made 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.050
 with the help of the metro fly further mode 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.800
 there are five alarm clocks 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.090
 alarm clocks 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.530
 and a start hour indication signal 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.570
 the beginning of each hour it will publish 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.860
 beep on the clock there is a stopwatch 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.760
 step one hundredth of a second 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.830
 countdown timer 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.710
 when he finishes 5 he gets tired 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.210
 beep and the world in time 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.530
 here you can see the time in 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.900
 the city you are interested in and reception mode 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.060
 radio signal i.e. calibration by 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.800
 You can turn on the radio signal or 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:00.250
 turn off the radio calibration that's all 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.880
 the data modes of the clock now I told 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.880
 equipment 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.430
 Watch the original cardboard box

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.950
 heart on it is all about given hours thanks 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.950
 for watching bye
