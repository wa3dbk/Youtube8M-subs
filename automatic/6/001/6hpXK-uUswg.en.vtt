 same I have here is the figure of the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.780
 YouTube protagonist that is a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.799
 man means I have mind in four 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.960
 leaves and it's something that you can see 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.860
 perfectly in your hair that is green and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.270
 with four coletitas 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.830
 Well I'm happy and dissatisfied with 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.270
 what I bought, I'm happy 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.600
 because I have a figure and I'm 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.250
 unhappy about how I'm going to have it 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.230
 is used to what will touch me 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.820
 do in fact I do not do it in my life what 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.850
 only dress has been far but good 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.070
 there's one time I'd have to do it today 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.660
 I'm going to show what I have in front of me and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.510
 that's why you will not be able to see the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.290
 figurine right now and they will guarantee a 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.260
 bit 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.260
 and the things that come but 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.490
 this is what I have ahead for 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.050
 get my figure I will teach a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.200
 little by little 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:10.819
 different faces this only 7 plush 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.180
 here we have a pair of sneakers and 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.180
 sleeves 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.310
 accessories 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.650
 masks this is so that I designed it as 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 I want with 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.500
 and here 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 they have a lot of designs 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.550
 hands 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.220
 t-shirts hair bags 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.780
 it's not going to happen very well that's why this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.430
 video is a little special burst in 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.480
 two parts the part where I tell you 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.210
 presented that what I'm seeing now 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.460
 same and the part you will already see the 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.550
 little figurine that I hope will not take long to throw 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.460
 the samples I'll be giving birth before 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.390
 now I leave for a while and we are 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.390
 until now 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.150
 finally finally I have it mounted on giving 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.650
 a few hours to do it good 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.510
 ok this is that does not take away either have 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.220
 been so many that you stop today but not so much 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.960
 and the truth is that although 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.960
 instructions scared a little the 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.520
 principle is all clear enough just 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.470
 it choked me a bit to mount his hair 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.620
 because there was a step of not having everything 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.810
 so clear but you know that everything was fast 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.520
 it was on wheels and no problem and 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.670
 nothing the truth is that wait has deserved 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.230
 it because we have to IOTs grapes 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.140
 mounted and as you can see is price already to me 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.900
 I love almost dare to say that you 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.810
 like more than figure to separate so 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.060
 throw him 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.270
 good as you can see chosen this face 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.540
 of the five that are other four there are 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.520
 apart and then the hand to say hello and 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.490
 One hand of accessories are six hands 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.730
 different you have like this say hello 8 carlos 5 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.830
 have you have so you have as indicating 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.740
 He has a clenched fist his fist is 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.419
 open there are a few everything 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.910
 necessary for you to put it as 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.460
 you want then I have chosen these 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.139
 pants to have it standing because if 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.600
 have other pants that are so that 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.090
 you feel them 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.820
 If you use it, I recommend you buy 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.980
 Use that pants to seat it because 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.800
 has already tried to settle the with these and is 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.870
 impossible 6-3 as it comes though it's a 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.550
 Too bad to have to be putting him 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.310
 removing him I do not know what idea of ​​what good 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.430
 as it used and is also any 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.800
 very cool things 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.190
 I chose this accessory also comes with 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.860
 a camera and a whistle 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.470
 I think it is and of course with société 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.630
 of stuffed could not miss good well the 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.150
 figure has several articulation point 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.500
 they have a hip 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:59.200
 has the head has the pigtails the 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.110
 elbow a little in the arm the shoulder 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.240
 the hands that can be moved just like that 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.650
 you can move it like that because it does not have the 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.310
 ball of articulation can move you 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:14.980
 feet knees and pants 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.560
 well this has been the chosen model 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.440

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.390
