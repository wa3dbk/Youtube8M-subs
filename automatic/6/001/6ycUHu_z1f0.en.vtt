00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
which I've really studied and had in the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:35.920 
which I've really studied and had in the
back<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.979> my<00:01:25.100> mind<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:34.820> morning<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.330> photograph

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
back of my mind the morning I photograph

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.930 
back of my mind the morning I photograph
the<00:01:36.080> Afghan<00:01:36.440> girl<00:01:36.680> on<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.830> refugee<00:01:37.220> camp<00:01:37.729> in

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
the Afghan girl on a refugee camp in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.690 
the Afghan girl on a refugee camp in
Pakistan<00:01:38.600> was<00:01:38.720> like<00:01:38.899> a<00:01:38.930> very<00:01:39.200> ordinary

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
Pakistan was like a very ordinary

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.400 
Pakistan was like a very ordinary
morning<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:41.119> fact<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.479> was<00:01:41.600> around<00:01:41.750> 11<00:01:42.170> o'clock

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
morning in fact it was around 11 o'clock

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.040 
morning in fact it was around 11 o'clock
and<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.700> light<00:01:43.940> was<00:01:44.500> impossible<00:01:45.530> very<00:01:45.770> bright

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
and the light was impossible very bright

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.690 
and the light was impossible very bright
reflecting<00:01:48.050> off<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.229> sand<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.520> was

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
reflecting off the sand so I was

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.960 
reflecting off the sand so I was
actually<00:01:49.940> looking<00:01:50.690> for<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.020> place<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:52.429> work

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
actually looking for a place to work

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.540 
actually looking for a place to work
inside<00:01:53.740> because<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.770> knew<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.130> light<00:01:55.280> would<00:01:55.429> be

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
inside because I knew the light would be

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.450 
inside because I knew the light would be
softer<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:57.020> could<00:01:57.200> actually<00:01:57.619> photograph

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
softer and I could actually photograph

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.340 
softer and I could actually photograph
which<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.179> know<00:01:59.300> much<00:01:59.659> much<00:02:00.020> better<00:02:00.229> effect

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
which you know much much better effect

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.070 
which you know much much better effect
so<00:02:01.190> as<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.729> was<00:02:01.850> walking<00:02:01.909> through<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:02.600> refugee

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
at her and I was sort of fretting about

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.319 
at her and I was sort of fretting about
the<00:02:25.250> book<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.519> was<00:02:25.640> working<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.000> because<00:02:26.239> it

the book I was working on because it

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.390

her<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.820> suddenly<00:02:29.720> thought<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.730> wonder<00:02:31.730> what

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
her and I suddenly thought I wonder what

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.490 
her and I suddenly thought I wonder what
Vermeer<00:02:32.299> did<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.630> her<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.900> make<00:02:32.930> her<00:02:33.049> look<00:02:33.320> like

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
Vermeer did to her to make her look like

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.220 
Vermeer did to her to make her look like
that<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:35.630> was<00:02:36.489> suddenly<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.549> revelation

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
that and it was suddenly a revelation

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.289 
that and it was suddenly a revelation
although<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.260> knew<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> lot<00:02:39.860> about<00:02:39.920> Vermeer<00:02:40.459> I

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
although I knew a lot about Vermeer I

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.650 
although I knew a lot about Vermeer I
had<00:02:41.690> never<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.200> thought<00:02:42.230> about<00:02:42.650> him

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
had never really thought about him

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.180 
had never really thought about him
except<00:02:44.660> as<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.079> painter<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> didn't<00:02:46.040> think
