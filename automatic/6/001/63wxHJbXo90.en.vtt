00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.130
 salud here super mukash coc we get 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.679
 found today for a video 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 we will say that it is the continuation of my 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.360
 first video my previous video 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.680
 it's hdv villages this special 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.000
 clan war so there are five 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 so here I am going to advise you a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.269
 little you say the disadvantages what has 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 improved all that so we went on 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.960
 starts with the first village then 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.309
 it's a village of someone who was 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.190
 in my clan then these villages 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 it's not bad that I have not tested 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.489
 but in clan war made him 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.170
 hardly 3 stars good of course 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 people hdv seven years ago already there are 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 people geneva and 10h 2009 who have it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.940
 attacked and obviously he got 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.690
 explode 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 like everyone else we die beijing level 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 3d dragons level 4 we can not do 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.290
 great thing at age dv7 so here's the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.700
 next village then this is this one 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.830
 so I'll tell you right now 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.409
 the disadvantage that I see on this 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.180
 village I do not know if you have it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.869
 found but it's the buildings all 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.909
 the buildings 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.619
 excuse me I have low battery 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.840
 it's Thursday is long it's the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.610
 free buildings all around because 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.829
 that there are too many with archers 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.890
 barbarians have cases either knowingly can 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.450
 easily do the 50% so on that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.369
 there bring closer the buildings if not the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.799
 feet they are well placed the bank 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.250
 giant the springs still bombs 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.380
 giant 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.979
 no otherwise overall it's a good 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.869
 village so if you want it well 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.500
 will go to the third village so 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.719
 that one I found on a video 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 youtube ousty gaming i do not know if you 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.600
 do you know it makes the club shocking 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.500
 so notice there i war dv7 game 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.090
 really not bad 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 he put the tank reserves all to 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.510
 outside because the war of 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.790
 it's useless because you're 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.430
 takes almost no gold when you 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.940
 takes almost no resources in me 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.670
 I think we take forty five thousand 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.050
 not even so that's me 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.550
 personally that's what I did 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.160
 but I will not introduce my village 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.720
 because it is an age of v8 but I 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.340
 will present in an upcoming video 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.930
 so that's so if not this one I he is 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.580
 really not bad especially well placed the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.280
 anti-aerial and heads 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.810
 researchers at the top because the anti 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 do not reach the top of the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.110
 town 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.640
 so here is wait I'm going 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.120
 maybe do but thin net because 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.330
 it's a bit noisy because at 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.640
 the inhabitants live age so there can there 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.030
 to have noises so here is this 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.430
 village there is a village drawn from a 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.019
 youtube video you see that touria no 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.590
 finished but we had to struggle until 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.500
 end and that's it it's right and 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.560
 gaming barracks all that after you place 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.030
 your pitfalls wherever you want most 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.269
 important is the two giant bombs 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.170
 here so here is so so world together a 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.170
 not bad village 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.489
 on the other hand I have someone he had 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.489
 in my in my bag leopard siete hdv 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.530
 May 7 if i was still a lot 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.570
 attacked it often made two 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.150
 stars 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.670
 So here we go to the last 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.220
 village seems to me where they season 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 we see the last village so 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.420
 always hd the seven 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.870
 so this village is a very village 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.980
 interesting simply because 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.099
 well he is well 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.510
 traps placed here for example you 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.820
 can put springs in there 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.699
 two holes finally that's no, otherwise it's 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.360
 a village really not bad we put 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:29.270
 giant banks of small bombs in 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.990
 the holes for example no but otherwise 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.900
 it's a good nasty george davis 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.139
 so here it is and I'm going to do a little 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.870
 announcement also is that like you 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.210
 noticed it in the teeth but two 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.199
 first videos I have not done 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.910
 video clash of clan on landemaine cash 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.580
 because I do not know if you know it but 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.190
 for tiririca myskreen you have to go down 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.020
 the date and I wrote strings myskreen that 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.510
 simply lead to each 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.430
 camp it does not work but you 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.470
 do not worry i'll soon get my 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.310
 computer so I could jailbreak 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.699
 my ipod 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.560
 and so I can were missing 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.880
 quarter of an hour is normally it's rummy 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.169
 so here soon I will do 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:21.950
 a video hd v8 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:27.020
 then after hdv eight special war of 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:29.450
 clans and after I will probably make age 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.490
 db9 finally i do not know too much because hdv 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.919
 up I'm not too specialized because 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.870
 only because I have not yet 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.060
 simply 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:43.280
 so that's none except when we go 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.190
 maybe market maybe to banos 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.389
 handle so bah I show you a 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.389
 device is my village 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.380
 so here they are then I avoid them as 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:00.790
 you've seen it's a new setback 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:07.390
 who intervenes to join a clan I 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:12.490
 I 'll show you all that's it so I 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:16.170
 will watch himself a match can he and 46 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:20.590
 it just takes without a trophy it takes a 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.820
 level 55th it seems to 60 because 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.640
 when you see there are still some 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.660
 big level 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.730
 I do not have 58 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:35.920
 I think he is yeah that's him there 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:38.980
 47 chairs but I do not know if 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.670
 will stay but there are very few levels 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.530
 out of 50 and two having cheated 5 years 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.940
 who will have a dozen and after 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:52.990
 everything else is 70 80 90 120 150 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.980
 rowers can either 505 all of that so that's it 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.360
 so wanted I invite you to join him 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:03.520
 today and not very active in the 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:07.030
 network so that's it if it works I 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.850
 will make a video on clash of anyway 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.610
