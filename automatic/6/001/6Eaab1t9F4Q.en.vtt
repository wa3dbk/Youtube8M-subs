 slightly puffy i.e. not liquid 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.840
 but will 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.129
 answer spread baking paper 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.220

 grease baking paper darkness 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.769
 lay out all the dough on a baking sheet 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.049
 it seems more convenient to do it like 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:13.019
 practice has shown 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:17.040
 silicone spatula and smear it 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.040
 across the surface of the pan 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.530
 such a thin layer no thicker 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 five millimeters 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.880

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:55.200
 millimeters like this here 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:58.870
 it turns out that there are no special laws 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.910
 smeared and oh well and now abundantly 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.910
 sprinkle with sugar 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.060
 by the way for cheese lovers 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.610

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:26.480
 dash on hard grated ruble cheese
