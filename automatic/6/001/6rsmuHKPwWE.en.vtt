opposed to the other wipes I've bought
in<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.530> past<00:01:03.729> this<00:01:04.729> packaging<00:01:05.540> it<00:01:05.780> has<00:01:05.960> this

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
in the past this packaging it has this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.929 
in the past this packaging it has this
little<00:01:06.500> clasp<00:01:06.860> right<00:01:07.460> there

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
little clasp right there

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.510 
little clasp right there
that<00:01:08.630> makes<00:01:09.229> it<00:01:09.439> more<00:01:09.560> secure<00:01:10.009> when<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.280> close

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
hygienic and they won't dry out so it's

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.100 
hygienic and they won't dry out so it's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
great the wipes themselves contain

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.580 
great the wipes themselves contain
salicylic<00:01:36.440> acid<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.390> tomato<00:01:38.390> extract<00:01:38.630> which

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
salicylic acid and tomato extract which

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.680 
salicylic acid and tomato extract which
is<00:01:39.710> great<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:40.369> salicylic<00:01:41.030> acid<00:01:41.479> is

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
is great because salicylic acid is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.320 
is great because salicylic acid is
usually<00:01:42.110> used<00:01:42.319> in<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:43.159> lot<00:01:43.399> of<00:01:43.640> beauty<00:01:43.940> products

for<00:01:44.659> skin<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.440> acne<00:01:45.590> because<00:01:46.429> it<00:01:46.640> cleans<00:01:46.940> out

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.990 
for skin and acne because it cleans out
and<00:01:47.479> dries<00:01:47.720> out<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.039> agnya<00:01:49.039> prevents<00:01:49.610> future

breakouts<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.830> tomato<00:01:51.830> extract<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.640> great

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
breakouts and tomato extract is great

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.449 
breakouts and tomato extract is great
because<00:01:53.360> tomatoes<00:01:53.630> are<00:01:53.929> known<00:01:54.229> for<00:01:54.709> sort<00:01:55.369> of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
stopped using them just to make sure it

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.410 
stopped using them just to make sure it
was<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.510> know<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.170> wipes<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.800> not<00:03:57.010> me<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.550> I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
was you know the wipes and not me and I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.449 
was you know the wipes and not me and I
stopped<00:03:58.840> using<00:03:59.080> them<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.980> cleared<00:04:00.280> up

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
stopped using them and it cleared up

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.970 
stopped using them and it cleared up
really<00:04:01.060> quickly<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:02.200> didn't<00:04:02.650> have<00:04:02.769> any

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
really quickly I didn't have any

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.540 
really quickly I didn't have any
blemishes<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:04.890> after<00:04:05.890> about<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.130> week<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.489> a

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
blemishes and after about a week and a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.600 
blemishes and after about a week and a
half<00:04:06.580> later<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.480> used<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.709> towels<00:04:08.950> again<00:04:09.250> lived

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
half later I used the towels again lived

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.300 
half later I used the towels again lived
a<00:04:09.790> little<00:04:09.880> wipes<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:11.590> gotta<00:04:11.860> act<00:04:12.070> mean

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
a little wipes and I gotta act mean

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.390 
a little wipes and I gotta act mean
again<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:13.120> my<00:04:13.780> conclusion<00:04:14.380> was<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.980> wipes<00:04:15.220> are

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
again so my conclusion was the wipes are

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.270 
again so my conclusion was the wipes are
giving<00:04:15.640> me<00:04:15.730> acne<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.510> don't<00:04:16.600> know<00:04:16.870> why<00:04:17.280> so

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
giving me acne and I don't know why so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.949 
giving me acne and I don't know why so
that<00:04:18.430> was<00:04:18.580> disappointing<00:04:18.729> because<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:19.570> really

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
that was disappointing because I really

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.100 
that was disappointing because I really
like<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.260> product<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.970> really<00:04:22.240> hoped<00:04:22.540> it

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
like the product and I really hoped it

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.620 
like the product and I really hoped it
would<00:04:23.380> work<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.640> could<00:04:24.820> use<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.300> in

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
would work and that I could use it in

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.250 
would work and that I could use it in
the<00:04:25.780> future<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:27.210> apparently<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:28.510> it's<00:04:28.870> not

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
the future but apparently it's it's not

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.310 
the future but apparently it's it's not
working<00:04:29.650> anymore<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.479> final<00:04:31.479> verdict<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.080> would

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
working anymore so final verdict I would

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.040 
working anymore so final verdict I would
say<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:33.130> would<00:04:33.669> give<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.940> like<00:04:34.150> three<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:34.990> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
say I would give it like three and a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.080 
say I would give it like three and a
half<00:04:35.229> four<00:04:35.860> stars

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
half four stars

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.970 
half four stars
is<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> good<00:04:37.510> product<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.200> did<00:04:38.350> work<00:04:38.530> for<00:04:38.590> me

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
is a good product and it did work for me

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.940 
is a good product and it did work for me
it<00:04:39.310> just<00:04:39.610> stopped<00:04:39.910> working<00:04:40.090> after<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.930> while<00:04:41.169> so

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
it just stopped working after a while so

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.800 
it just stopped working after a while so
if<00:04:42.250> anybody<00:04:42.610> out<00:04:42.669> there<00:04:42.790> does<00:04:43.240> want<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.540> try<00:04:43.750> it

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
if anybody out there does want to try it

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.300 
if anybody out there does want to try it
doesn't<00:04:44.260> want<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.440> buy<00:04:44.560> it<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.860> see<00:04:45.040> how<00:04:45.190> it

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
doesn't want to buy it and see how it

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.600 
doesn't want to buy it and see how it
works

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
works

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.879 
works
I<00:04:45.700> recommend<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.510> because<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:47.139> might<00:04:47.470> not<00:04:47.680> have

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
I recommend it because it might not have

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:48.870

that<00:04:48.010> effect<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.430> you

that effect on you
it<00:04:49.120> might<00:04:49.389> just<00:04:49.419> continue<00:04:50.230> working

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
it might just continue working

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.370 
it might just continue working
