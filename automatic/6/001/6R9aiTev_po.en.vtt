00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.929
 the world cup is approaching and the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.540
 TV industry expects to profit 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.970
 with the sale of new 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 ownership is on larger TVs with more than 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.990
 thirty-nine inches adrenaline 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.240
 received for analysis one of these models 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.369
 consumer dreams in the next few minutes 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 you check our impressions on 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.080
 the eff device eight thousand and five hundred 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.510
 64 inches from samsung 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.059
 the tv has full hd plasma screen with 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.040
 3d camera converter controls by 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.020
 movement and voice and allows access to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 applications as well as any other 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.579
 other device of the smart type the edges 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.329
 Brushed metal leave foresee beautiful 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 it's modern 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.530
 The finish is high quality and a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 Support bracket also made of metal is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 securely and firmly 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.760
 Another striking feature is the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.879
 thickness of 55.4 millimeters 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.010
 already the weight of the TV with the support is 36 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 kilograms beyond the standard 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.740
 energy and other components 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 the ef 8,500 comes with four hdmi ports 31 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 usb 2.0 and a lan port the tv can be 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 controlled by voice or by gestures more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.659
 nothing replaces good old control 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 Remote addition to the standard number of the tv 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.830
 samsung comes with specifics for 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.229
 functions it has a touchpad 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 that helps and much in the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.110
 to activate the voice command 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.030
 The standard is smart TV. The TV has a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 guide with a series of words that can 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 be told to perform certain 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.030
 function and also offers some options 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.310
 according to what is open in the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 screen as soon as the command is activated 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 function is very good and works 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 correctly just know what to say 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.000
 now if it is useful depends on the taste of each 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.250
 one 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 the gesture control also works 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.880
 tv house is well positioned 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.610
 the closer to the ground the better 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.770
 after all the camera that captures the gestures is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.329
 on the top of the unit and if you 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.469
 want to control while you are 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.140
 sitting on the couch 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.030
 It is good that the hacker is down but what 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.879
 interests in a tv are the image and the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 sound and f 8.500 has excellent 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.630
 audiovisual resources 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.610
 images are clear thanks to the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.950
 I think of colors and have details of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.440
 shade and good levels of black that help 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.540
 to view the video in depth 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.850
 tv is also very good and it can be 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.670
 easily assisted in an environment with 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.860
 the conversion to the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.530
 3d is also well done with realism 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.970
 great vibrant and bright images 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.910
 many are left behind with this 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.140
 function and an 8,500 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.240
 make that impression 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.070
 although there is not much 4k 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.080
 moment the lack of support for this 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.180
 resolution may be a burden in the future 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.850
 anyway who buys a TV of this size 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.650
 want it for at least a decade 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.390
 the sound does not quite impress why 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.310
 does not mean it 's bad 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.800
 He gives the message and has a good 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.480
 even on larger TVs. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.180
 fine is expected to be limited 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400
 because of the thickness of the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.350
 the most interesting is the possibility of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.430
 set up according to the environment in the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.290
 What 's the tv? 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.960
 the speakers are located in the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.030
 back of the TV 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.860
 navigating the fast smart interface 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.380
 intuitive but the interaction with 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.730
 resources present in them with exceptions 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.710
 falls short 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.840
 the idea of â€‹â€‹using the television as a 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.030
 computer for routine applications 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.680
 such as web access via browser and 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.870
 viewing e-mails for example 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.850
 still needs to be improved 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.160
 the built-in TV camera may be a 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.900
 of the most interesting features 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.780
 it enables the use of recognition 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.980
 facial and video chat applications 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.900
 like skype 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.750
 but her position on tv 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.100
 hinders its use in our case 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.230
 while sitting on the couch with the television 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.450
 mounted on a piece of furniture with 80 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.370
 inches tall we had to stay 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.520
 standing to appear on the screen something 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.140
 nothing usual and comfortable to effect 1,500 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.330
 can be found in major stores 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.010
 online retailing is costing 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.200
 eight and nine thousand reais 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.370
 the value is quite high but it does not reach 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.310
 so scary in a market where 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.310
 smarttvs already cost up to 40 thousand reais
