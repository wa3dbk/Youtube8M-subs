two weeks I definitely would recommend

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.529 
two weeks I definitely would recommend
doing<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.490> every<00:04:46.879> two<00:04:47.000> weeks<00:04:47.180> for<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.389> young

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
doing it every two weeks for a young

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.659 
doing it every two weeks for a young
hair<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.050> depends<00:04:48.590> how<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.099> define<00:04:49.220> deep

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
hair but it depends how you define deep

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:50.830 
hair but it depends how you define deep
clean<00:04:49.879> if<00:04:50.000> you're<00:04:50.120> just<00:04:50.270> soaking<00:04:50.569> your<00:04:50.659> hair

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
clean if you're just soaking your hair

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480 
clean if you're just soaking your hair
in<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.990> bowl<00:04:51.169> full<00:04:51.349> of<00:04:51.409> water<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:52.009> bicarb<00:04:52.370> soda

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
in a bowl full of water and bicarb soda

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.040 
in a bowl full of water and bicarb soda
it's<00:04:52.849> not<00:04:52.970> such<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.180> big<00:04:53.330> deal<00:04:53.389> but<00:04:53.810> if<00:04:53.930> you're

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
it's not such a big deal but if you're

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.320 
it's not such a big deal but if you're
going<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.740> whole<00:04:54.889> hog<00:04:55.129> and<00:04:55.340> then<00:04:55.490> soaking

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
going the whole hog and then soaking

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.820 
going the whole hog and then soaking
with<00:04:56.449> apple<00:04:56.810> cider<00:04:56.930> vinegar<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.470> rinsing<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
with apple cider vinegar and rinsing the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.649 
with apple cider vinegar and rinsing the
apple<00:04:58.009> cider<00:04:58.099> vinegar<00:04:58.220> that's<00:04:58.699> probably<00:04:59.449> not

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
apple cider vinegar that's probably not

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:00.939 
apple cider vinegar that's probably not
such<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.900> good<00:04:59.990> idea<00:05:00.110> especially<00:05:00.409> for<00:05:00.860> young

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
such a good idea especially for young

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.589 
such a good idea especially for young
dreads<00:05:01.190> because<00:05:01.460> apple<00:05:01.729> cider<00:05:01.819> vinegar<00:05:01.970> will

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
dreads because apple cider vinegar will

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:03.999 
dreads because apple cider vinegar will
condition<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.259> soften<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.590> hair<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:03.919> that's

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
condition and soften the hair and that's

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.529 
condition and soften the hair and that's
not<00:05:04.250> really<00:05:04.490> making<00:05:04.789> it<00:05:04.970> all<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.270> dread

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
not really making it all that dread

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.120 
not really making it all that dread
friendly<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.139> it's<00:05:06.289> fine<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.530> use<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:06.949> every

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
friendly so it's fine to use it every

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.260 
friendly so it's fine to use it every
now<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.370> again<00:05:07.400> on<00:05:07.639> your<00:05:07.729> dreads<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:08.000> soften

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
now and again on your dreads to soften

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.089 
now and again on your dreads to soften
the<00:05:08.419> dreads<00:05:08.630> but<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.319> know<00:05:09.409> if<00:05:09.620> you're<00:05:09.800> gonna

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
the dreads but you know if you're gonna

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.760 
the dreads but you know if you're gonna
do<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.639> really<00:05:11.030> often<00:05:11.569> it's<00:05:11.780> not<00:05:11.960> really<00:05:12.560> a

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
do it really often it's not really a

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.219 
do it really often it's not really a
good<00:05:13.310> idea<00:05:13.340> how<00:05:14.090> often<00:05:14.360> do<00:05:14.449> I<00:05:14.479> recommend<00:05:14.780> you

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
good idea how often do I recommend you

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.110 
good idea how often do I recommend you
know<00:05:15.349> once<00:05:15.560> every<00:05:15.830> one<00:05:16.099> to<00:05:16.310> two<00:05:16.460> months<00:05:16.639> and

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
know once every one to two months and

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.719 
know once every one to two months and
I'm<00:05:17.270> far<00:05:18.139> near<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.620> two<00:05:19.039> months<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.580> one

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
I'm far near the two months and the one

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.430 
I'm far near the two months and the one
month<00:05:19.940> but<00:05:20.240> for<00:05:20.479> younger<00:05:20.930> dreads<00:05:21.259> you

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
month but for younger dreads you

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.140 
month but for younger dreads you
probably<00:05:21.889> don't<00:05:22.159> really<00:05:22.340> need<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.699> do<00:05:22.819> it<00:05:22.940> all

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
probably don't really need to do it all

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.480 
probably don't really need to do it all
that<00:05:23.300> often<00:05:23.539> anyway<00:05:24.139> right<00:05:24.740> merely<00:05:25.069> how<00:05:25.430> to

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
that often anyway right merely how to

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.790 
that often anyway right merely how to
partially<00:05:26.150> brush<00:05:26.360> out<00:05:26.569> a<00:05:26.810> dread<00:05:27.199> to<00:05:27.349> split<00:05:27.620> it

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
partially brush out a dread to split it

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.980 
partially brush out a dread to split it
in<00:05:27.949> two<00:05:28.219> right<00:05:28.699> well<00:05:29.030> I<00:05:29.060> don't<00:05:29.479> know<00:05:29.569> why<00:05:29.750> you'd

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
in two right well I don't know why you'd

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.779 
in two right well I don't know why you'd
want<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.289> partially<00:05:31.039> brush<00:05:31.219> out<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.430> drug

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
want to partially brush out a drug

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.149 
want to partially brush out a drug
before<00:05:31.969> you<00:05:32.180> split<00:05:32.449> it<00:05:32.569> in<00:05:32.690> two<00:05:33.169> I'm<00:05:33.530> slightly

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
before you split it in two I'm slightly

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.129 
before you split it in two I'm slightly
confused<00:05:34.400> I'm<00:05:34.789> I<00:05:35.030> wouldn't<00:05:35.539> recommend<00:05:35.780> try

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
confused I'm I wouldn't recommend try

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.779 
confused I'm I wouldn't recommend try
split<00:05:36.469> a<00:05:36.500> fully-formed<00:05:37.009> right<00:05:37.340> into<00:05:37.639> two

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
split a fully-formed right into two

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.640 
split a fully-formed right into two
because<00:05:38.180> let's<00:05:38.990> say<00:05:39.050> you<00:05:39.139> start<00:05:39.409> off<00:05:39.469> with<00:05:39.590> a

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
because let's say you start off with a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.040 
because let's say you start off with a
dread<00:05:39.830> this<00:05:39.979> big<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:41.210> try<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.659> split<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:41.990> into

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
dread this big and try and split it into

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.930 
dread this big and try and split it into
two<00:05:42.529> dreads<00:05:42.770> just<00:05:43.039> by<00:05:43.130> cutting<00:05:43.370> up<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.729> middle

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
two dreads just by cutting up the middle

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.159 
two dreads just by cutting up the middle
the<00:05:44.029> two<00:05:44.060> dreads<00:05:44.330> that<00:05:44.419> you<00:05:44.539> get<00:05:44.690> are<00:05:44.900> not

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
the two dreads that you get are not

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.260 
the two dreads that you get are not
gonna<00:05:45.349> be<00:05:45.529> as<00:05:45.770> thick<00:05:46.039> or<00:05:46.219> as<00:05:46.310> strong<00:05:46.789> as<00:05:46.969> half

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
gonna be as thick or as strong as half

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.640 
gonna be as thick or as strong as half
the<00:05:47.539> original<00:05:47.630> drag<00:05:48.110> you're<00:05:48.319> gonna<00:05:48.409> lose

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
the original drag you're gonna lose

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.050 
the original drag you're gonna lose
stuff<00:05:48.949> because<00:05:49.219> the<00:05:49.340> hairs<00:05:49.520> do<00:05:49.729> not<00:05:49.880> grow

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
stuff because the hairs do not grow

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.390 
stuff because the hairs do not grow
straight<00:05:50.389> down<00:05:50.599> to<00:05:51.229> be<00:05:51.380> split<00:05:51.650> they<00:05:52.039> go<00:05:52.190> like

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
straight down to be split they go like

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.890 
straight down to be split they go like
this<00:05:52.639> so<00:05:53.120> you're<00:05:53.300> gonna<00:05:53.419> split<00:05:53.690> down<00:05:53.840> the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
this so you're gonna split down the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.260 
this so you're gonna split down the
middle<00:05:54.110> and<00:05:54.319> you're<00:05:54.409> gonna<00:05:54.500> lose<00:05:54.770> bits<00:05:55.099> so<00:05:55.819> for

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
middle and you're gonna lose bits so for

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.269 
middle and you're gonna lose bits so for
one<00:05:56.419> I<00:05:56.449> wouldn't<00:05:56.840> recommend<00:05:57.110> doing<00:05:57.529> it<00:05:57.770> if<00:05:57.919> you

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279 
one I wouldn't recommend doing it if you

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:00.219 
one I wouldn't recommend doing it if you
were<00:05:58.520> gonna<00:05:58.819> split<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.330> drive<00:05:59.569> in<00:05:59.690> two<00:05:59.840> then<00:06:00.080> I

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
were gonna split a drive in two then I

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.230 
were gonna split a drive in two then I
wouldn't<00:06:01.009> partially<00:06:01.400> brush<00:06:01.550> it<00:06:01.669> out<00:06:01.849> I<00:06:02.060> would

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
wouldn't partially brush it out I would

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.170 
wouldn't partially brush it out I would
brush<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.810> whole<00:06:02.990> thing<00:06:03.409> out<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:04.060> start<00:06:05.060> it

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
brush the whole thing out and start it

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.999 
brush the whole thing out and start it
again<00:06:05.389> as<00:06:05.509> two<00:06:05.690> dreads<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.199> then<00:06:06.650> you'll<00:06:06.830> have

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
again as two dreads and then you'll have

saturate it with conditioner and then

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.469 
saturate it with conditioner and then

pick it out like with a knitting needle

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.600 
pick it out like with a knitting needle
or<00:06:17.690> a<00:06:17.750> sewing<00:06:18.229> needle<00:06:18.349> or<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.800> crochet<00:06:19.219> hook<00:06:19.250> and

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.510 
or a sewing needle or a crochet hook and
use<00:06:19.819> it<00:06:20.000> like<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.389> one<00:06:20.750> tooth<00:06:21.080> comb<00:06:21.469> and<00:06:21.680> very

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
use it like a one tooth comb and very

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.790

slowly and carefully brush it out and

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.559 
slowly and carefully brush it out and
then<00:06:25.099> you'll<00:06:25.279> end<00:06:25.430> up<00:06:25.550> with<00:06:25.849> just<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.300> hair

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
then you'll end up with just the hair

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.779 
then you'll end up with just the hair
and<00:06:26.930> that's<00:06:27.349> how<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:27.620> get<00:06:27.919> dreadlocks<00:06:28.580> out

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
and that's how you get dreadlocks out

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.459 
and that's how you get dreadlocks out
without<00:06:29.090> losing<00:06:29.360> hair<00:06:29.569> and<00:06:29.840> then<00:06:30.139> I<00:06:30.169> would
