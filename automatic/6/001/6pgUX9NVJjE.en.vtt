here moto chopper 1.3 XT 926 if I

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.130 
here moto chopper 1.3 XT 926 if I
extracted<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.849> just<00:02:27.180> named<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.840> right

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
extracted it and just named this right

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.190 
extracted it and just named this right
here<00:02:28.909> so<00:02:29.909> you're<00:02:30.030> gonna<00:02:30.150> need<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.599> right

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.830 
there the other thing you're gonna need
is<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.120> Motorola<00:02:33.930> drivers<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.269> I<00:02:36.269> will<00:02:36.510> link

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
is the Motorola drivers and I will link

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.530 
is the Motorola drivers and I will link
them<00:02:37.019> for<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.190> an<00:02:38.310> exe<00:02:38.790> file<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
them for you it's just an exe file you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.780 
them for you it's just an exe file you
run<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.140> installs<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.709> drivers<00:02:41.129> so

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
run and it installs the drivers so

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550 
run and it installs the drivers so
that's<00:02:42.180> pretty<00:02:42.420> basic<00:02:42.629> but<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.230> said<00:02:43.349> I'll

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
guys an idea what is actually going to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.130 
guys an idea what is actually going to
happen<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:06.390> basically<00:03:06.750> what<00:03:06.989> they're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
happen here so basically what they're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.559 
happen here so basically what they're
doing<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.620> they<00:03:08.099> have<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> modified<00:03:08.819> boot<00:03:09.239> image

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
doing is they have a modified boot image

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.170 
doing is they have a modified boot image
and<00:03:10.190> what's<00:03:11.190> gonna<00:03:11.310> happen<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.849> it's<00:03:11.879> gonna

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and what's gonna happen is it's gonna

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.909 
and what's gonna happen is it's gonna
flash<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.870> modified<00:03:13.379> boot<00:03:13.620> image<00:03:14.060> which<00:03:15.060> is

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
flash that modified boot image which is

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.509 
flash that modified boot image which is
flash<00:03:16.919> boot<00:03:17.220> boot<00:03:17.720> old<00:03:18.720> boot<00:03:19.440> image<00:03:19.829> flashes

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
flash boot boot old boot image flashes

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.270 
flash boot boot old boot image flashes
this<00:03:20.669> file<00:03:21.049> then<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.739> gives<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
this file then it that gives it the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.940 
this file then it that gives it the
exploit<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.940> needs<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.480> go<00:03:24.660> ahead<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.319> do<00:03:25.919> all

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
exploit it needs to go ahead and do all

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.710 
exploit it needs to go ahead and do all
the<00:03:26.310> routing<00:03:26.489> process<00:03:27.150> which<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.450> right<00:03:27.690> here

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
the routing process which is right here

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.220 
the routing process which is right here
and<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:29.790> when<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.180> done<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.540> reboots<00:03:30.930> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
and then when it's done it reboots and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.580 
and then when it's done it reboots and
then<00:03:31.349> again<00:03:31.980> flashes<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.510> new<00:03:34.109> boot<00:03:34.290> image

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
then again flashes the new boot image

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.490 
then again flashes the new boot image
the<00:03:34.829> one<00:03:34.980> you're<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.220> right<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:36.169> back<00:03:37.169> to<00:03:37.379> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the one you're on right now back to the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.409 
the one you're on right now back to the
device<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.129> reboots<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.849> it's<00:03:39.030> done<00:03:39.209> it's

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
device and reboots and it's done it's

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.770 
device and reboots and it's done it's
pretty<00:03:39.690> simple<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:41.449> basically<00:03:42.449> we're<00:03:42.750> just

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
pretty simple so basically we're just

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.509 
pretty simple so basically we're just
going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.169> run<00:03:43.349> this

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.819 

we<00:03:46.519> have<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.060> USB<00:03:47.269> drivers<00:03:47.810> installed<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.650> we

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
we have the USB drivers installed and we

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.709 
we have the USB drivers installed and we
have<00:03:49.040> USB<00:03:49.430> debugging<00:03:49.670> enabled<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.599> we're

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
have USB debugging enabled and we're

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.009 
have USB debugging enabled and we're
connected<00:03:51.170> via<00:03:51.950> USB<00:03:52.659> so<00:03:53.659> all<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> our

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
connected via USB so all of our

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.899 
connected via USB so all of our
prerequisites<00:03:54.769> are<00:03:54.920> met<00:03:54.980> we're<00:03:55.609> gonna<00:03:55.700> go

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
prerequisites are met we're gonna go

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.910 
prerequisites are met we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.569> hit<00:03:56.870> enter<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:59.530> it's<00:04:00.530> just<00:04:00.799> going

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
ahead and hit enter and it's just going

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.649 
ahead and hit enter and it's just going
to<00:04:00.980> make<00:04:01.129> sure<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.150> see<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.359> device

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
to make sure that you can see the device

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.459 
to make sure that you can see the device
here<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.889> can<00:04:04.099> so<00:04:04.849> found<00:04:05.150> device<00:04:05.480> it's

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:06.469 
here and it can so found device it's

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.699 
here and it can so found device it's

already rebooting here you can see some

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.400 
already rebooting here you can see some
stuff<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:28.880> done

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
stuff it's done

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.520 
stuff it's done
sending<00:04:30.410> boot<00:04:30.620> writing<00:04:31.130> boot<00:04:32.139> rebooting<00:04:33.139> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
vise reboots and then it's going to go

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.450 
vise reboots and then it's going to go
through<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:35.599> exploit<00:04:36.110> of<00:04:36.460> actually

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
through the little exploit of actually

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.100 
through the little exploit of actually
sending<00:04:37.759> the<00:04:37.880> root<00:04:38.060> files<00:04:38.389> over<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.870> the

sending the root files over to the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.900 
sending the root files over to the
device<00:04:41.800> shouldn't<00:04:42.800> take<00:04:43.039> too<00:04:43.070> terribly<00:04:43.820> long

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
device shouldn't take too terribly long

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.140 
device shouldn't take too terribly long
here<00:04:44.919> alright<00:04:45.919> so<00:04:46.220> here<00:04:46.400> we<00:04:46.490> go<00:04:46.639> we're<00:04:46.849> sending

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
here alright so here we go we're sending

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.980 
here alright so here we go we're sending
the<00:04:47.330> files<00:04:47.599> over<00:04:48.400> pretty<00:04:49.400> basic<00:04:49.669> as<00:04:50.659> soon<00:04:50.870> as

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
the files over pretty basic as soon as

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.499 
the files over pretty basic as soon as
this<00:04:51.139> is<00:04:51.470> done<00:04:51.800> it's<00:04:52.639> going<00:04:52.909> to<00:04:53.090> reboot<00:04:53.389> the

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
this is done it's going to reboot the

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.029 
this is done it's going to reboot the
device<00:04:53.599> again

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.269 

okay

so<00:05:02.909> it<00:05:03.029> says<00:05:03.329> right<00:05:04.009> here<00:05:05.009> to<00:05:05.429> press<00:05:06.029> ENTER<00:05:06.359> to

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
so it says right here to press ENTER to

so it says right here to press ENTER to
restore<00:05:07.049> your<00:05:07.259> boot<00:05:07.439> image<00:05:07.739> so<00:05:08.279> it's<00:05:08.429> gonna

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
we go here you can see we're in fastboot

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.859 
we go here you can see we're in fastboot
down<00:05:15.869> on<00:05:16.019> the<00:05:16.109> phone<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:17.729> it's<00:05:18.269> writing<00:05:18.539> boot

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:26.579 
over here on the computer it says root

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:29.809 
over here on the computer it says root
is<00:05:26.699> complete<00:05:27.119> press<00:05:27.449> ENTER<00:05:27.869> and<00:05:28.799> it<00:05:29.279> exits<00:05:29.669> out

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
so we're done on the computer now let's

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.999 
so we're done on the computer now let's
go<00:05:32.339> over<00:05:32.369> to<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:33.029> device<00:05:33.179> and<00:05:33.829> watch<00:05:34.829> this

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
go over to the device and watch this

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.079 
go over to the device and watch this
thing<00:05:35.069> lit<00:05:35.369> up<00:05:37.009> so<00:05:38.009> we<00:05:38.189> are<00:05:38.279> booting<00:05:38.579> up<00:05:38.699> here

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
thing lit up so we are booting up here

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.869 
thing lit up so we are booting up here
this<00:05:39.659> is<00:05:39.899> the<00:05:40.110> second<00:05:40.829> reboot<00:05:41.189> on<00:05:41.399> it<00:05:41.579> and<00:05:41.759> the

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:41.879 
this is the second reboot on it and the

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.479 
this is the second reboot on it and the
device<00:05:42.029> is<00:05:42.360> fully<00:05:42.659> booted<00:05:42.869> so<00:05:43.709> let's<00:05:44.189> go<00:05:44.369> ahead

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:44.489 
device is fully booted so let's go ahead

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:49.399 
device is fully booted so let's go ahead
and<00:05:44.779> unplug<00:05:45.779> our<00:05:46.529> cable<00:05:47.159> and<00:05:47.779> now<00:05:48.779> we<00:05:48.839> want<00:05:49.319> to

and unplug our cable and now we want to
see<00:05:49.589> if<00:05:49.829> the<00:05:50.159> process<00:05:50.639> actually<00:05:50.999> fully

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:51.209 
see if the process actually fully

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:52.669 
see if the process actually fully
functioned<00:05:51.749> for<00:05:51.929> us<00:05:52.049> so<00:05:52.169> let's<00:05:52.199> go<00:05:52.409> into<00:05:52.589> our

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:52.679 
functioned for us so let's go into our

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:55.039 
functioned for us so let's go into our

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
for a supersuit there it is right there

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.029 
for a supersuit there it is right there
so<00:06:08.219> we're<00:06:08.399> gonna<00:06:08.459> click<00:06:08.759> on<00:06:08.789> it<00:06:09.379> says<00:06:10.379> you<00:06:10.919> need

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
to install the SU binary so they

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:17.719 
to install the SU binary so they
continue<00:06:12.869> say<00:06:13.169> normal<00:06:15.379> successful<00:06:16.409> and<00:06:16.729> there

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
continue say normal successful and there

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.759 
continue say normal successful and there
you<00:06:17.849> go<00:06:18.029> that<00:06:18.749> is<00:06:18.779> it<00:06:19.229> that's<00:06:19.409> the<00:06:19.589> full
