shoe<00:02:38.400> off<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:40.770> couldn't<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.280> ask<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:41.760> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
shoe off you couldn't really ask for a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.910 
shoe off you couldn't really ask for a
better<00:02:42.000> combination<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.500> one<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
better combination so this is one of the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.430 
better combination so this is one of the
probably<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> major<00:02:44.870> part<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.080> shoe<00:02:46.290> that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.700 
wraps around like the back part of the
shoe<00:03:08.880> I'm<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:09.810> gonna<00:03:09.990> lie<00:03:10.170> when<00:03:10.380> I've<00:03:10.470> seen

pictures<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.760> shoe<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.330> actually<00:03:12.750> thought

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
pictures of this shoe I actually thought

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.810 
pictures of this shoe I actually thought
this<00:03:13.230> was<00:03:13.410> like<00:03:13.440> almost<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.070> diamond-cut

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
this was like almost like a diamond-cut

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.090 
this was like almost like a diamond-cut
look<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.240> that's<00:03:15.390> how<00:03:15.510> glossy<00:03:15.780> was<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
look to it that's how glossy was in the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.190 
look to it that's how glossy was in the
picture<00:03:17.460> maybe<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:18.480> person<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.050> had<00:03:19.170> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
picture maybe that person just had a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.470 
picture maybe that person just had a
great<00:03:19.590> camera<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.250> uh<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.670> really<00:03:21.180> thought<00:03:21.330> it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
great camera but uh I really thought it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.270 
great camera but uh I really thought it
was<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> diamond-cut<00:03:22.560> look<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:23.010> give<00:03:23.190> you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
was like a diamond-cut look to give you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.580 
was like a diamond-cut look to give you
like<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.460> chiseled<00:03:24.030> look<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> guess<00:03:25.410> it's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
like a chiseled look but I guess it's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.230 
like a chiseled look but I guess it's
just<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.980> glossy<00:03:26.460> that's<00:03:26.640> how<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.850> looks

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
just so glossy that's how it looks

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.660 
just so glossy that's how it looks
