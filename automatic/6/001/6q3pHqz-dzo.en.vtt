00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.080
 thank you how good afternoon is going 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.600
 Avidly the rumors begin to emerge 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 in the celestial machine of blue cross between 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.809
 they are speculated that josé de jesús 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.180
 crown would be wearing the coat of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 chivas the next campaign however the 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.390
 cancerbero assured that he has not had 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.020
 no contact with the directive of the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.110
 herd is only a rumor the truth 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.850
 the day that they mark me or the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.080
 directive we will let you know in 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.880
 this moment we can not make a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.560
 comment about it now I owe 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.629
 a blue course 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.030
 I am very grateful to the institution 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.739
 with the love that I have always had 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.020
 backed at all times 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.980
 it's a clear honor if it were 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.370
 and that rumor 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 a large team with the goats as 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.870
 will look at my services but for the 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.879
 moment saw the present 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.930
 Tomorrow we do not know how 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.270
 professionals we know that we are 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.670
 exposed to changes on the other hand 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.440
 the team still does not rise from 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.079
 psychic blow that meant the defeat 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.000
 who suffered last weekend before 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.340
 the red devils of toluca however 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 they do not approve what he did achile emaná that 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.330
 he stayed in the dressing room after 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.820
 left change at the end of the first 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.979
 part as a professional I think that 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.649
 there must be for the team no no so 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.830
 individual you should not know is 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.539
 Professional is already great too 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.310
 do not carry what I do not what it is 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.890
 a young man with a career which should 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.830
 understand that nobody here is above 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.450
 from an institution of a team I think 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.450
 which is a subject that should analyze 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.670
 we are on the court we are 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 out of it we always have to be 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 with the group contributing supporting and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.659
 supporting the partner are things that we 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 they touch us, I do not think there's 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.110
 people who 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.500
 what does it have to look at what is the part 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.360
 of discipline and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 He is a partner of ours and it hurts us but 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.860
 I think there are things there where we 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.180
 we can not go beyond the issue of 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.280
 discipline is a subject that has to be 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.930
 sacred within a group of football you 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.880
 of the reasons for the reverse suffered by the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.320
 cement square is precisely that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.580
 the players are not in the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.929
 better soccer level 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.640
 and spend more there 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.010
 when individually it is not right 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.490
 collectively, it is also noticeable and the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.710
 obviously team 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.080
 it has not been regular throughout the tournament 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.200
 and the group is this first 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.990
 party have not sent us enough 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.240
 strong you want or not no if this does not end 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.790
 well therefore improving analyzes will have 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.610
 things and possibly there will be people who do not 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.590
 will not be gentlemen to the information 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.900
 that came up here on the Ferris wheel I come back with 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.230
 you very good afternoon thank you for 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.230
 nothing
