00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.370

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.350

 I do not hurt anything 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.750
 on the contrary 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750
 continue your prayer 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.900
 that your name be sanctified what do you mean by that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 lighting 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 she means that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.030
 I do not know what I mean 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.100
 good it's just part of the prayer chokes 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.160
 man or not 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.910
 is different from the others 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.800
 no no and I susi 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.970
 it does not tell you anything 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.000
 soucy 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I had never really thought about selling 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.860
 may your kingdom come 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.460

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 reign come 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.540
 what am I doing here 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 but nothing at all 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.590
 tailor 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.620
 it seems to me that it would not be so bad 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.100
 side of the evil to direct everything is not like the bike 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 do i run m 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 the worst 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.100
 I go to church 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.420
 finally 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.630
 haguenau and happy 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 ap ap 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.600
 jv course 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.049
 you know 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.329
 leading to Rennes has already begun 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.430
 - troy omitting those who follow in my son's footsteps 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.399
 are you sure to walk in his footsteps 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.799
 shot of social lords sites for all those people who are going to 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.739
 the church every Sunday morning 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.039
 how can it be that my will 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.419
 be made 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.849
 it is those who ask for it do not begin by accomplishing it 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.639
 by the way I know I have problems 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.299
 I am not a saint 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.679
 me too 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.939
 so maybe I'd like to get rid of all those countries the 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:44.920
 hopes there 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.379
 that prevents me from being really free 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.839
 We move forward 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:52.459
 we will work together you and me and I see that victories 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.349
 no 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.170
 tonight it's going too far 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.170
 is it for all that 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.949
 in our time so far 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.949
 the future trust for the pope 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.549
 pray 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.069
 etam dangerous act 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.069
 who could end up being changed who knows 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.399
 but you have not finished with prayer 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.379
 keep on going 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.489
 well 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 keep on going 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.169
 I can not 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.639
 you are scared 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.429
 I know what that means 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.429
 and so 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.999
 forgive us our offenses 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.519
 like the parliament at the smi 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.320
 not sure they compensated us 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.999
 you think about brigitte 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.959
 I knew I was going to talk about brigitte 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.300
 but it's good she hurt me a lot you understand 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.619
 for me it is the prayer 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.619
 that's a matter of habit that's all 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.029
 you are crazy at least 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:15.749
 but it's not easy to wear mr designs does not it 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.239
 no it's not easy 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.509
 but I will study it 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.250
 the weight that I will not be in those years 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.370
 - cyril much better it will not be better 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.520
 on the contrary 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 you are already sad 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.520
 I can change all that 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.650
 you can 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.439
 and how 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.819
 everywhere we have not thought 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.889
 when one day 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.889
 I forgave you 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.940
 nan is to say if I can not forgive after j -c here I can not 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.300
 not 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.300
 what are currently saying 4th 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.069
 I'm going to try 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.550
 to forgive brigitte 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.550
 maybe you could try to talk to them too 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.999
 everything happened very close every morning 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.919
 that's not what happens to me 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.919
 finish your prayer 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.349
 do not subject us to temptation 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.589
 but he delivers bout of the mall 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.539
 that's what I'll do 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.259
 but three 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.680
 to get away from evil 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.740
 to learn who 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.669
 when my love 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.199
 because it's yours 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.710
 belong 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.219
 every century 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.219
 the reign 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.819
 the power 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.960
 and glory 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 that grace 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.479
 your companion
