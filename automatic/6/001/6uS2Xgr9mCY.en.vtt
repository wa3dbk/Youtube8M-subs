00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.689
 do today the current age the index makes club kinetix with told j 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.880
 I start with the basics 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.219
 at 16 exam itself has proposals i am cisco dams and dykes board member 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.959
 learning so to speak 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.779
 I also the 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.359
 I have you two songs ready for you to learn sometimes through the 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.279
 drag tests you grab a number and drag it 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.609
 nac the trainer you want 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.119
 juice prepared two numbers 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 then the town can be the one by persuading them 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.190
 and then you look for renault dezir clubs all still standing well 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.460
 and no then you start 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 years 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 and then no decision has been made 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.330
 dunya 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.310
 I want to wait for you to usually go a bit late 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 until next to good piece to decide 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 and if you have to end up with such a ship 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.560
 then normally arriving which runs up a bit everything goes so offers 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.920
 You may also find that this one at one offers more 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.320
 you can if you close your headphones this year you can do 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 by dragging annie giro number 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.390
 can you handle 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.380
 make a career listen to that song before it goes over the boxes 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 here 2 in the second round you can do that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.370
 and then agree that you also look forward to the offers that is 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.590
 that is more of it 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.750
 that is there and then you already have it ready for the beat 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 and if you resembled them both 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.020
 then it is supposed to be that you have a pass of b cells a little lower 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.060
 start turning 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.390
 and this starts completely low 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.510
 Davey that is the bast a second place then the moment you get a pair 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.480
 they must be too soft to walk on late to put on these bark 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.190
 if you finally have to wear it together that year 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.720
 because that goes through the ppr with ppm that this knew his own talents upstairs 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.220
 pick up the turntable 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.889
 that is say spermine offers it and then 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.070
 if you are very different then the ball are quickly different 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.780
 and you don't want that because then you know the whole cunt if you have a car 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.780
 I flew will grow 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.969
 then the bark sounds very different 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.239
 and so you do not want to go into the cell I can 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.739
 joe click 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.430
 neos and chronic honor to that means that he is going to make bags equal 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.799
 this is such a big difference i would show myself that works with such a big one 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.899
 difference the stunning sound is going to sound 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.309
 the beaches closely as the retreat as you do it with bass 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:16.189
 So if you let it be heard, inflation will do less and ANP will do less 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.719
 as liam 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:24.540
 if the bpm is the same 128 man scenario you search here in this list they serve 128 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.649
 taken we love it your 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.109
 128 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.109
 they themselves have the beats I think we have it here 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.339
 after a nice piece of rotterdam you click on a mcdonald's lost in the twilight 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.259
 the train traffic other players I have synchronize 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.299
 and you see that now also fails to be completely equal 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.609
 you can overflow with enough open it is only a bit trickier than 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.609
 they all say 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.409
 but i also less beautiful is the easiest just by but this 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.549
 and bpm do the same 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.479
 Tuesday is going to show me earlier that you can also do sempels in between 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.479
 play what are say sounds 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 year 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.689
 the right size was created on the beats of the music so don't worry 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:35.610
 worried about 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.819
 so you still have all sounds and you can also do what the remakes 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.979
 making something more eighty can add a few effects to us just for a moment 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.979
 see 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.699
 you can also do a lot with it 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.339
 we have saved a very nice one that piet wishes 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.249
 this says if you are going to make index is the future use you can this will 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.249
 change 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.840
 and you can't play like that and there you still have the effects to let yourself walk 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.120
 You will hear that it was really nice to walk over to the game perfectly 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.979
 people with and in the hall 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.669
 a bit to do days because it sounds a bit shaefer right away 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.939
 I can hope I have this and space until next time 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.349
 and it seems that this period gives very much terms thank you alem if you still 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.180
 more bold videos image about from yes a game in the newest games and greasy 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.059
 indexes 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:17.949
