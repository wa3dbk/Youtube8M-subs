00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
I'm using the Mississippi as a metaphor

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.950 
I'm using the Mississippi as a metaphor
for<00:04:57.460> wandering<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.699> know<00:04:58.969> and<00:04:59.240> just<00:04:59.569> that

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
for wandering you know and just that

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.320 
for wandering you know and just that
kind<00:05:00.169> of<00:05:00.319> boyish<00:05:00.800> sort<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.460> going<00:05:02.000> with<00:05:02.300> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
kind of boyish sort of going with the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.659 
kind of boyish sort of going with the
flow<00:05:02.449> of<00:05:02.840> wandering<00:05:03.319> I<00:05:03.590> mean<00:05:04.340> one<00:05:04.550> thing

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
flow of wandering I mean one thing

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.420 
flow of wandering I mean one thing
that's<00:05:04.729> distinctive<00:05:05.509> I<00:05:05.689> think<00:05:05.960> about<00:05:06.430> about

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
that's distinctive I think about about

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.580 
that's distinctive I think about about
some<00:05:07.639> of<00:05:07.759> my<00:05:07.789> work<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.210> that<00:05:08.289> there's<00:05:09.289> a<00:05:09.379> real

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
some of my work is that there's a real

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.399 
some of my work is that there's a real
mix<00:05:09.949> so<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.669> it's<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.900> know<00:05:11.990> when<00:05:12.139> I'm<00:05:12.259> at<00:05:12.349> a

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
mix so it's it's you know when I'm at a

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.279 
mix so it's it's you know when I'm at a
you<00:05:13.039> know<00:05:13.129> a<00:05:13.159> wedding<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.879> someone<00:05:14.150> says<00:05:14.419> you

pictures do you take and then I go oh
you<00:05:20.659> know<00:05:20.779> like<00:05:20.960> it's<00:05:21.289> tough<00:05:21.500> because<00:05:21.740> I

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
you know like it's tough because I

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.740 
you know like it's tough because I
photograph<00:05:22.599> portraits<00:05:23.599> landscapes<00:05:24.169> and

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
photograph portraits landscapes and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
photograph portraits landscapes and
still<00:05:26.750> lives<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:29.090> it's<00:05:29.469> but<00:05:30.469> it's<00:05:30.589> not

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
still lives and so it's but it's not

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.390 
still lives and so it's but it's not
documentary<00:05:31.550> but<00:05:32.060> it's<00:05:32.240> not<00:05:32.419> staged<00:05:33.169> it's<00:05:33.740> you

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
documentary but it's not staged it's you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.879 
documentary but it's not staged it's you
know<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:34.849> so<00:05:35.569> it's<00:05:35.719> complicated<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.770> explain

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
know so so it's complicated to explain

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.839 
know so so it's complicated to explain
it<00:05:37.339> and<00:05:38.270> I<00:05:39.199> mean<00:05:39.469> the<00:05:39.770> goal<00:05:39.979> of<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.370> is<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.490> weave

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
it and I mean the goal of it is to weave

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.800 
it and I mean the goal of it is to weave
all<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.419> these<00:05:41.569> different<00:05:42.080> pictures<00:05:42.770> together

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
all of these different pictures together

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.170 
all of these different pictures together
in<00:05:44.810> in<00:05:45.259> a<00:05:45.469> sort<00:05:45.740> of<00:05:45.770> novelistic<00:05:46.310> way<00:05:46.759> although

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
in in a sort of novelistic way although

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.610 
in in a sort of novelistic way although
it's<00:05:47.419> not<00:05:47.569> a<00:05:47.599> novel<00:05:48.069> but<00:05:49.069> to<00:05:49.219> try<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:50.469> just<00:05:51.469> as

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:31.089 
I and and for me the act of
photographing<00:06:27.589> other<00:06:27.800> people<00:06:28.370> is<00:06:28.810> is<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:30.740> sort

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
photographing other people is is a sort

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.950 
photographing other people is is a sort
of<00:06:31.219> an<00:06:31.370> act<00:06:31.550> of<00:06:31.699> therapy<00:06:32.210> it's<00:06:32.389> like<00:06:32.629> it's<00:06:32.839> a

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
of an act of therapy it's like it's a

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.059 
of an act of therapy it's like it's a
way<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.139> get<00:06:33.650> over<00:06:33.979> this<00:06:34.240> fear<00:06:35.709> at<00:06:36.709> least<00:06:36.889> at

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069 
way to get over this fear at least at

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.730 
way to get over this fear at least at
the<00:06:37.159> beginning<00:06:37.250> it<00:06:37.669> was<00:06:37.789> like<00:06:37.819> that

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
the beginning it was like that

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.810 
the beginning it was like that
and<00:06:39.040> so<00:06:39.640> when<00:06:40.120> I<00:06:40.150> started<00:06:41.040> as<00:06:42.040> a<00:06:42.100> photographer

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
and so when I started as a photographer

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.940 
and so when I started as a photographer
I<00:06:43.120> just<00:06:43.660> photographed<00:06:44.080> everybody<00:06:44.590> you<00:06:44.830> know

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
I just photographed everybody you know

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.880 
I just photographed everybody you know
just<00:06:45.250> it's<00:06:45.610> like<00:06:45.670> practice<00:06:46.420> and<00:06:46.720> then<00:06:47.620> over

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
just it's like practice and then over

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.550 
just it's like practice and then over
time<00:06:48.130> I<00:06:48.190> just<00:06:48.640> developed<00:06:49.630> this<00:06:49.870> sensibility

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
time I just developed this sensibility

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.120 
time I just developed this sensibility
this<00:06:50.980> this<00:06:51.460> I<00:06:51.930> had<00:06:52.930> an<00:06:53.050> attraction<00:06:53.350> to<00:06:53.770> certain

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
this this I had an attraction to certain

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.950 
this this I had an attraction to certain
people<00:06:54.370> for<00:06:54.790> whatever<00:06:55.000> reason<00:06:55.570> I<00:06:55.660> kind<00:06:55.840> of

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
people for whatever reason I kind of

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.180 
people for whatever reason I kind of
knew<00:06:56.140> it<00:06:56.380> when<00:06:56.560> I<00:06:56.590> see<00:06:56.890> it

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
knew it when I see it

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.990 
knew it when I see it
and<00:06:59.040> so<00:07:00.040> it's<00:07:00.990> so<00:07:01.990> when<00:07:02.080> you<00:07:02.200> ask<00:07:02.380> like<00:07:02.940> how<00:07:03.940> do

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
and so it's so when you ask like how do

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.090 
and so it's so when you ask like how do
I<00:07:04.150> find<00:07:04.420> the<00:07:04.570> people<00:07:04.840> I<00:07:04.930> found<00:07:05.200> you<00:07:05.830> know<00:07:05.950> it's

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
I find the people I found you know it's

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.060 
I find the people I found you know it's
there's<00:07:06.670> not<00:07:06.850> an<00:07:06.970> easy<00:07:07.090> answer<00:07:07.240> but<00:07:07.870> it's<00:07:08.070> I'm

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
there's not an easy answer but it's I'm

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.540 
there's not an easy answer but it's I'm
drawn<00:07:09.910> toward<00:07:10.300> them
