which is why the FFF AAA is doing so

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.709 
which is why the FFF AAA is doing so

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
see it flies through the air pretty

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.700 
see it flies through the air pretty
comfortably<00:02:08.170> shooting<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.319> was<00:02:09.530> quite

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
comfortably shooting this was quite

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.340 
comfortably shooting this was quite
difficult<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.520> about<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.759> foot<00:02:11.300> across<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
difficult it's about a foot across and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.400 
difficult it's about a foot across and
trying<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.970> camera<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.840> look<00:02:15.110> at<00:02:15.290> it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
trying to get the camera to look at it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.830 
trying to get the camera to look at it
while<00:02:15.620> while<00:02:15.920> doing<00:02:16.159> that<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.730> picking<00:02:17.659> it<00:02:17.690> up

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
while while doing that and picking it up

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.479 
while while doing that and picking it up
in<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.049> sky<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.830> said<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.129> likes<00:02:19.310> to

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
in the sky because as I said it likes to

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.340 
in the sky because as I said it likes to
shoot<00:02:19.730> up<00:02:19.909> quite<00:02:20.180> high<00:02:20.209> with

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.420 
shoot up quite high with
fairly<00:02:22.010> difficult<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.840> let's<00:02:24.020> take<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.410> look<00:02:25.190> at

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
fairly difficult so let's take a look at

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.750 
fairly difficult so let's take a look at
the<00:02:26.000> at<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.960> Phantom<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.580> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
the at the Phantom and so this is the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.210 
the at the Phantom and so this is the
drone<00:02:29.000> it's<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.570> quadcopter<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.620> got<00:02:30.890> four

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
drone it's a quadcopter it's got four

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.330 
drone it's a quadcopter it's got four
propellers<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:32.420> propellers<00:02:33.230> almost<00:02:33.980> touch

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
propellers the propellers almost touch

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.180 
propellers the propellers almost touch
in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.240> center<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:35.810> these<00:02:35.960> are<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.200> largest

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
in the center so these are the largest

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.730 
in the center so these are the largest
propellers<00:02:37.840> give<00:02:38.840> or<00:02:38.870> take<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.290> couple<00:02:39.470> of

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
propellers give or take a couple of

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.370 
propellers give or take a couple of
millimeters<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.840> quadcopter<00:02:41.840> can

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
millimeters that this quadcopter can

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.660 
millimeters that this quadcopter can
take<00:02:42.650> got<00:02:43.100> four<00:02:43.610> engines<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:45.500> think<00:02:46.220> they

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
take got four engines and I think they

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.690 
take got four engines and I think they
counter<00:02:47.300> rotate<00:02:47.740> certainly<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:48.980> screw<00:02:49.520> them

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
counter rotate certainly you screw them

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.530 
counter rotate certainly you screw them
in<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.740> counter<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.610> keeps<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.150> stable

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
in a counter so that it keeps it stable

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.990 
in a counter so that it keeps it stable
there's<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.380> big<00:02:54.710> bat<00:02:55.160> free<00:02:55.460> honor<00:02:55.640> which<00:02:55.970> is

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
there's a big bat free honor which is

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.140 
there's a big bat free honor which is
this<00:02:56.450> thing<00:02:56.750> here<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.830> battery<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.580> be<00:02:58.850> a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
this thing here the battery can be a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.960 
this thing here the battery can be a
little<00:02:59.330> tight<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.860> know<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.100> sign<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> Good

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
little tight you know a sign of the Good

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.860 
little tight you know a sign of the Good
Manufacturing<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.890> battery<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.340> in

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
Manufacturing is that the battery is in

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.960 
Manufacturing is that the battery is in
quite<00:03:05.870> tight<00:03:06.170> it's<00:03:06.410> not<00:03:06.440> loose<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.370> pulling<00:03:07.880> it

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
quite tight it's not loose so pulling it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.040 
quite tight it's not loose so pulling it
out<00:03:08.030> could<00:03:08.240> be<00:03:08.300> a<00:03:08.330> bit<00:03:08.450> difficult<00:03:08.660> if<00:03:08.960> you're

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
out could be a bit difficult if you're

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.370 
out could be a bit difficult if you're
not<00:03:09.670> gasps<00:03:10.670> luckily<00:03:10.880> no<00:03:11.210> matter<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.990> battery

get about 25 minutes flight time
according<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.760> jive<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.620> found<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.100> be

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
according to the jive I found that to be

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.570 
according to the jive I found that to be
fairly<00:03:32.630> close<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.320> mark<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.830> never<00:03:34.400> got

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
fairly close to the mark I never got

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.380 
fairly close to the mark I never got
longer<00:03:35.360> than<00:03:35.990> 25<00:03:36.530> minutes<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.820> nor<00:03:38.150> did<00:03:38.300> I

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
longer than 25 minutes but nor did I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.710 
longer than 25 minutes but nor did I
ever<00:03:38.510> get<00:03:38.810> less<00:03:39.200> than<00:03:39.620> 20<00:03:40.400> minutes<00:03:40.430> or<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.120> so

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
ever get less than 20 minutes or so so

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.890 
ever get less than 20 minutes or so so
it's<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.380> reasonably<00:03:43.280> accurate<00:03:43.850> assessment<00:03:44.720> if

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
it's a reasonably accurate assessment if

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.700 
it's a reasonably accurate assessment if
all<00:03:45.680> things<00:03:45.950> are<00:03:46.250> good<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:48.080> camera<00:03:48.500> then

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
all things are good and the camera then

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.520 
all things are good and the camera then
is<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.640> 14<00:03:50.030> megapixel<00:03:50.720> thing<00:03:51.050> I<00:03:51.170> mentioned

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
is the 14 megapixel thing I mentioned

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.750 
is the 14 megapixel thing I mentioned

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
cinematography you're going to be a

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.340 
cinematography you're going to be a
little<00:04:50.650> bit<00:04:50.860> disappointed<00:04:51.760> if<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.780> if<00:04:53.230> you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
little bit disappointed if you if you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.200 
little bit disappointed if you if you
rotate<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:53.980> drones<00:04:54.400> or<00:04:54.640> if<00:04:54.700> it's<00:04:54.820> here<00:04:55.000> like

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
rotate the drones or if it's here like

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.060 
rotate the drones or if it's here like
this<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.630> you<00:04:55.690> rotate<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.140> it's<00:04:56.470> very<00:04:56.740> very

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
this and you rotate it it's very very

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.600 
this and you rotate it it's very very
janky<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:58.290> jerky<00:04:59.290> whereas<00:05:00.100> if<00:05:00.250> you've<00:05:00.370> got<00:05:00.580> a

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
janky and jerky whereas if you've got a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.690 
janky and jerky whereas if you've got a
gimbal<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.750> will<00:05:02.050> do<00:05:02.200> a<00:05:02.230> lot<00:05:02.650> smoother<00:05:03.190> so<00:05:03.520> if

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
gimbal it will do a lot smoother so if

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.400 
gimbal it will do a lot smoother so if
you're<00:05:03.910> looking<00:05:04.510> to<00:05:04.600> do<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> lot<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.050> drone

resetting the GPS and things like that

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.520 
resetting the GPS and things like that
you'll<00:06:04.000> flick<00:06:04.270> one<00:06:04.840> of<00:06:04.930> them<00:06:05.080> up<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.350> down<00:06:05.500> a

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
you'll flick one of them up and down a

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.340 
you'll flick one of them up and down a
few<00:06:05.860> times<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:06.310> do<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.900> right-hand

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
few times to do that the right-hand

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.530 
few times to do that the right-hand
drone<00:06:08.910> controls<00:06:09.990> forward<00:06:10.990> left<00:06:11.350> right<00:06:11.980> back

whereas the left hand stick controls
high<00:06:17.080> so<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:17.620> go<00:06:17.710> up<00:06:17.890> and<00:06:18.040> down<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.580> also

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
high so you go up and down and also

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.080 
high so you go up and down and also
turning<00:06:19.870> so<00:06:20.770> it<00:06:20.890> does<00:06:21.100> in<00:06:21.340> that<00:06:21.610> theater<00:06:21.970> to

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
turning so it does in that theater to

access the two remotes or their or the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.510 
access the two remotes or their or the
the<00:06:25.510> two<00:06:25.780> joysticks<00:06:26.050> feel<00:06:26.560> pretty<00:06:27.100> good<00:06:27.340> in

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
the two joysticks feel pretty good in

the two joysticks feel pretty good in
the<00:06:27.610> hand<00:06:27.790> there's<00:06:28.600> nothing<00:06:29.230> wrong<00:06:29.560> with<00:06:29.620> them

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
the hand there's nothing wrong with them

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.800 
the hand there's nothing wrong with them
they're<00:06:30.250> quite<00:06:30.430> sensitive<00:06:31.030> quite<00:06:31.570> like<00:06:31.780> that

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
they're quite sensitive quite like that

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.220 
they're quite sensitive quite like that
the<00:06:32.260> height<00:06:32.860> one<00:06:33.130> will<00:06:33.790> lock<00:06:34.150> then<00:06:34.810> the<00:06:34.990> bottom

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
the height one will lock then the bottom

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.960 
the height one will lock then the bottom
it<00:06:35.350> has<00:06:35.380> a<00:06:35.500> little<00:06:35.980> lock<00:06:36.310> at<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.550> bottom<00:06:36.790> here

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
it has a little lock at the bottom here

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.690 
it has a little lock at the bottom here
so<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:37.780> when<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.230> start<00:06:38.710> up<00:06:38.890> the<00:06:39.070> rotors<00:06:39.460> it

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
so that when you start up the rotors it

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.180 
so that when you start up the rotors it
locks<00:06:40.210> in<00:06:40.420> the<00:06:40.510> down<00:06:40.750> position<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.470> then<00:06:42.010> you

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
locks in the down position and then you

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.380 
locks in the down position and then you
have<00:06:42.460> to<00:06:42.490> bring<00:06:43.030> it<00:06:43.270> black<00:06:44.200> out<00:06:44.470> and<00:06:44.740> start

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
have to bring it black out and start

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.700 
have to bring it black out and start
increasing<00:06:46.390> the<00:06:46.660> height

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
increasing the height

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.470 
increasing the height
all<00:06:47.800> in<00:06:47.980> all<00:06:48.130> it's<00:06:48.370> a<00:06:48.550> pretty<00:06:48.940> well-made

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
all in all it's a pretty well-made

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.000 
all in all it's a pretty well-made
remote<00:06:51.240> there's<00:06:52.240> no<00:06:52.390> problems<00:06:53.200> with<00:06:53.380> it<00:06:53.440> which

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
remote there's no problems with it which

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.590
