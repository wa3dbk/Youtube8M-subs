00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
before the trick starters you make the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
before the trick starters you make the
prediction<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.450> says<00:01:24.860> 16<00:01:26.299> okay<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> then

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
prediction which says 16 okay so then

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.030 
prediction which says 16 okay so then
the<00:01:29.250> spectator<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.939> shop<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> deck<00:01:31.040> okay

so then we're going to do this I'm going
to<00:01:35.250> count<00:01:35.460> cards<00:01:35.790> okay<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> count

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to count cards okay so you have to count

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
to count cards okay so you have to count
15<00:01:39.869> cards<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.250> take<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.579> pack

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
15 cards it's going to take this pack

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.560 
15 cards it's going to take this pack
this<00:01:42.030> card<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> 16th<00:01:43.439> position<00:01:43.939> ok<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.000> if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
this card on the 16th position ok so if

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389 
this card on the 16th position ok so if
you<00:01:45.630> make<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:45.990> own<00:01:46.290> prediction<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.220> let's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you make your own prediction so let's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.960 
you make your own prediction so let's
say<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.820> take<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.600> number<00:01:48.680> 20<00:01:49.680> okay<00:01:49.970> so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
say that you take the number 20 okay so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.359 
say that you take the number 20 okay so
you<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.200> number<00:01:52.590> 20<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.040> rejection

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you have the number 20 of rejection

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.200 
you have the number 20 of rejection
they're<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.450> count<00:01:54.630> 19<00:01:55.380> cards<00:01:55.770> okay<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
they're going to count 19 cards okay so

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
they're going to count 19 cards okay so
I'm<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> explain<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.049> later<00:01:58.350> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
I'm going to explain to that later so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
I'm going to explain to that later so
you<00:01:59.399> make<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> prediction<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> fold<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you make the prediction you fold it and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.310 
you make the prediction you fold it and
you<00:02:00.930> put<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.229> somewhere<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> pocket<00:02:02.130> okay
