00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of my first video blogs it is like i

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.869 
of my first video blogs it is like i
said<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:45.260> 47.7<00:00:46.260> units<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.190> something<00:00:47.550> per

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
said we had 47.7 units or something per

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.360 
said we had 47.7 units or something per
semester<00:00:48.120> well<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
semester well it's that's like for the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
semester well it's that's like for the
year<00:00:50.760> i<00:00:50.969> guess<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.360> our<00:00:51.660> school<00:00:52.350> runs<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
year i guess because our school runs on

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.479 
year i guess because our school runs on
like<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.960> year<00:00:54.960> instead<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> semester<00:00:56.399> by

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
like a year instead of semester by

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
like a year instead of semester by
semester<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:57.120> they're<00:00:57.449> still<00:00:57.660> broken<00:00:57.989> up

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
semester like they're still broken up

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810

of<00:04:15.750> little<00:04:15.930> tools<00:04:16.169> here<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.979> keep<00:04:17.250> mixing

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
of little tools here that I keep mixing

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.670 
of little tools here that I keep mixing
up<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.690> did<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:21.229> now<00:04:22.229> we<00:04:22.320> got<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.530> figure

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
up so I did this now we got to figure

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.220 
up so I did this now we got to figure
out<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.010> what's<00:04:23.250> what

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.420 

basically<00:04:28.230> we're<00:04:28.380> just<00:04:28.410> need<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:29.100> figure<00:04:29.310> out

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
basically we're just need to figure out

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.120 
basically we're just need to figure out
how<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.910> work<00:04:30.420> with<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:30.720> murder<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.260> position

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
how to work with this murder a position

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.830 
how to work with this murder a position
of<00:04:32.220> properties<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.730> get<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.970> right<00:04:33.090> light<00:04:33.390> i'm

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
of properties to get the right light i'm

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.350 
of properties to get the right light i'm
also<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.230> right<00:04:34.530> like<00:04:34.890> angle<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.090> if<00:04:36.270> you

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
