00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.390 
really good I think it does the most
damage<00:03:16.489> per<00:03:16.970> second<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.510> black<00:03:17.840> ops<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:18.400> you

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
damage per second in black ops so you

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.800 
damage per second in black ops so you
can<00:03:19.580> actually<00:03:19.730> take<00:03:20.150> people<00:03:20.450> out<00:03:20.570> pretty

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
can actually take people out pretty

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.590 
can actually take people out pretty
easily<00:03:21.050> with<00:03:21.230> this<00:03:21.440> gun<00:03:22.000> sometimes<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.180> find<00:03:23.390> it

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
easily with this gun sometimes I find it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.449 
easily with this gun sometimes I find it
even<00:03:23.720> beats<00:03:24.050> though<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.530> famas<00:03:24.860> users<00:03:25.220> and

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
even beats though the famas users and

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.180 
even beats though the famas users and
all<00:03:25.880> users<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.450> stuff<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.840> but<00:03:27.230> what<00:03:28.160> I

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
all users and stuff like that but what I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.400 
all users and stuff like that but what I
really<00:03:28.459> like<00:03:28.610> about<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.970> gun<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.410> actually

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
really like about the gun is actually

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.040 
really like about the gun is actually
you<00:03:30.950> know<00:03:31.070> along<00:03:31.580> with<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.940> high<00:03:32.480> rate<00:03:33.019> of

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
you know along with the high rate of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.960 
you know along with the high rate of
fire<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.709> can<00:03:33.860> put<00:03:33.980> extended<00:03:34.400> mags<00:03:34.580> on<00:03:34.790> this

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
fire you can put extended mags on this

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.050 
fire you can put extended mags on this
and<00:03:35.530> basically<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.980> shoots<00:03:37.250> really<00:03:37.519> fast<00:03:37.790> and

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
and basically it shoots really fast and

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.610 
and basically it shoots really fast and
it<00:03:38.150> does<00:03:38.269> not<00:03:38.420> have<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.840> much<00:03:38.900> recoil<00:03:39.320> at<00:03:39.530> all

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
it does not have that much recoil at all

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.620 
it does not have that much recoil at all
the<00:03:40.190> muzzle<00:03:40.519> flashes<00:03:40.970> but<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.180> find<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
the muzzle flashes but I find the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.720 
the muzzle flashes but I find the
problem<00:03:41.840> with<00:03:42.170> usually<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.160> think<00:03:43.519> i<00:03:43.610> was

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
problem with usually I think i was

the muzzle flash is a little big and it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.949 
the muzzle flash is a little big and it
kind<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.530> blocks<00:03:55.070> your<00:03:55.280> view<00:03:55.459> sometimes<00:03:55.959> but

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
kind of blocks your view sometimes but

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.600 
kind of blocks your view sometimes but
the<00:03:57.049> iron<00:03:57.230> sights<00:03:57.500> are<00:03:57.799> they're<00:03:58.190> pretty<00:03:58.400> bad

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
the iron sights are they're pretty bad

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.400

but you know I like them I like the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.860 
but you know I like them I like the
stoner<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:02.299> know<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.570> pretty<00:04:02.690> good

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870

gun<00:04:03.049> but<00:04:03.230> like<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.440> said<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.739> can<00:04:03.890> be<00:04:03.920> considered

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
gun but like I said it can be considered

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.580 
gun but like I said it can be considered
new<00:04:04.760> be<00:04:04.940> too<00:04:05.120> many<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:06.170> don't<00:04:06.350> really<00:04:06.470> like

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
new be too many and I don't really like

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.410 
new be too many and I don't really like
how<00:04:06.890> how<00:04:07.250> slow<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.549> move<00:04:07.700> with<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.030> but<00:04:08.299> other

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
how how slow you move with it but other

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.610 
how how slow you move with it but other
than<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.720> think<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:09.110> is<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.260> pretty<00:04:09.410> good

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
