00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
martial arts and you also had people

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
martial arts and you also had people
interested<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> fact<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.910> god

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
interested in the fact that my god

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.180 
interested in the fact that my god
someone<00:00:36.480> could<00:00:36.719> actually<00:00:36.899> die<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.590> once

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
someone could actually die and once

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.470 
someone could actually die and once
again<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.820> was<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.420> was

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
again you know this was this was

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.709 
again you know this was this was
something<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> UFC<00:00:40.739> itself<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.460> saying

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
something that the UFC itself was saying

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.709 
something that the UFC itself was saying
and<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.730> gave<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
and I think that you know it gave way to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.869 
and I think that you know it gave way to
a<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.620> large<00:00:46.829> audience<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> same

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
a very large audience but at the same

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
a very large audience but at the same
time<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.360> also<00:00:48.390> gave<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.230> ammunition<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
time it also gave a lot of ammunition to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.549 
time it also gave a lot of ammunition to
the<00:00:49.920> politicians<00:00:50.239> who<00:00:51.239> definitely<00:00:51.870> sought<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the politicians who definitely sought to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.970 
the politicians who definitely sought to
have<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> banned<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> shows<00:00:54.780> continued<00:00:55.469> but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
