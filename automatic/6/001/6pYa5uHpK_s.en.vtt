00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 Today we show you how to make a healthy oat milk 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 Pour a cup of oatmeal in 6 cups of hot water a small teaspoon of salt 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 2 crusts of orange or lemon in this case we have used orange 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.700
 and a cinnamon stick 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.809
 When it reaches a boil, let it simmer for about 20 minutes 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.690
 stirring from time to time there is no need to worry about the foam that is 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.630
 it's forming, it's normal 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.900
 Remove carefully so that the cinnamon stick does not break 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:33.600
 and the orange peels spill everything in a masher or Chinese 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:52.799
 while Enrique crushes it. 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:04.229
 We went through a colander Mila is helping with circular movements 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:19.010
 when it is cold we put it with the help of a funnel in the final container 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:36.269
 and can you 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.069
 Hold up to 3 days in the fridge and that's how it looks, we hope you like it 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.569
 and HEALTH FOR ALL!
