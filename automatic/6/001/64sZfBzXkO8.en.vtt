00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
down the sights because now it actually

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
down the sights because now it actually
requires<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:07.799> precision<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
requires a little more precision and

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
cuz I feel like it takes the fun out of

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.940 
cuz I feel like it takes the fun out of
sniping<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.060> makes<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.570> too<00:04:46.230> easy<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.830> makes

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
sniping it makes it too easy and makes

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.110 
sniping it makes it too easy and makes
it<00:04:47.190> cheap<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.820> makes<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:49.220> too<00:04:50.220> easy<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.730> require

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
it cheap it makes it too easy to require

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.020 
it cheap it makes it too easy to require
kill<00:04:51.510> without<00:04:51.690> actually<00:04:52.470> even<00:04:52.680> aiming<00:04:53.040> it's

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
kill without actually even aiming it's

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.490 
kill without actually even aiming it's
kind<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.390> an<00:04:54.540> auto<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.140> game<00:04:55.350> is

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
kind of like an auto and the game is

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.660 
kind of like an auto and the game is
doing<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.770> work<00:04:55.920> for<00:04:55.950> you<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.460> I'm<00:04:56.550> not

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670

doing the work for you and I'm not
saying<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.150> auto<00:04:57.420> aim<00:04:57.630> is<00:04:57.810> bad<00:04:58.020> because

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
saying that auto aim is bad because

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.440 
saying that auto aim is bad because
without<00:04:58.710> auto<00:04:59.040> aim<00:04:59.130> its<00:04:59.460> other<00:04:59.940> games<00:05:00.150> pretty

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
without auto aim its other games pretty

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.080 
without auto aim its other games pretty
much<00:05:00.690> like<00:05:01.020> retardedly<00:05:01.950> hard<00:05:02.310> like<00:05:02.760> I've<00:05:02.880> done

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
much like retardedly hard like I've done

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.600 
much like retardedly hard like I've done
it<00:05:03.210> I've<00:05:03.330> gone<00:05:03.540> like<00:05:03.780> five<00:05:04.290> Katie<00:05:04.920> games<00:05:05.310> that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
