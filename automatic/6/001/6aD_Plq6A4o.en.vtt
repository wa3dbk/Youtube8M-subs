00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:18.369
 Starting from 3rd in Qualifying, Wolfie is the first to start as the 2nd in start 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:25.000
 Going up and making good laps, the second fastest Florian 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:28.520
 I was on the third but I always finished well as usual in the pit stop 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.220
 Even if the installation is in top level 1 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:38.300
 Go be sure to complete the race in such a state that attaches to the back of the wartime I It is the last 1 hour 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.480
 Top Bentley just yourself in the third hand is when it was entrusted with the stint 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.130
 The last No. 2 hand in a state that Audi yourself 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:52.190
 Nagai I'd teacher or has entered twice after its restart last 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:55.760
 To be able to say with a chance where it summarizes the Audi answer Torre 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:00.920
 Bathurst 12 hours that I was able to win the top 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.539
 It is an Australian race, but a strong car maker from Europe 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.600
 I have been competing 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:12.180
 I felt that it was the world's top preparation time endurance race and the course is 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.230
 Anyway, it is very challenging 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.390
 Because there are many high risk corners 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.170
 It was a rough race that the safety car went out to practice 20 times , so care was taken until the end 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.380
 Do not leave 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.870
 I think it was a really high level race 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:31.390
 As that applied to the re-start of the chance to warm It is a front tire anyway 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.930
 Firmly centralized 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
 What 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.190
 At the time of restart, I can not sleep to the line now 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.520
 In the last corner it because it was told the wind rules say can be in the eyes of the anterior column berry lined 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.530
 Together firmly timing 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.439
 If the accelerator is open and the data is before one corner, this may not be possible 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.969
 Just thinking about Bentley 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:02:01.140
 Since the stripe My data it was the opinion of not a little to believe in yourself that time 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:01.510
 Worksop fairly color really the car to be true to was perfect I was able to run also put self-confidence 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.830
 this 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:09.880
 It also was higher I think that came running up here speaking and I think that has been over a period of 12 hours team 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:16.200
 Because it is a race, so I do not know what will happen to the end 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.200
 I did not feel honest until I saw the checkered flag around the final corner 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.800
 12 after having put 3rd time first in 4 front 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.310
 Gone a little too far with the feeling to say Paul was taken 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.650
 4 corners of the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.150
 Painting on the wall 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.840
 I think that I was really sorry for the team because I hit from Lear 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.510
 I will 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:41.230
 Who is only is it that team fix the car the day before the race in the real hard work 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:46.640
 The race start was 5:50 am 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:52.970
 It is 4:30 that the car is completed, and it will work without sleep until the last moment 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 The race can run in a great car that does not really make that crash feel 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.280
 I really want to thank the team 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.330
 It is also two Urufi and Florian after teammate 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.660
 The day I got that was the second year I ran last year , but Floriano is in the first year of this year 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.190
 It ran faithfully constantly to really strategy they Among them 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:15.560
 Thanks to you , the last lap went and I really got a chance 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.560
 I want to say to Fu that Thank you also two teammates 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:25.030
 I myself too gt r nismo gt 3 videos gt from the time of debut 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:29.980
 Running together and fighting the European cabber season and its gt r 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:35.660
 A big race called this Bathurst sequential time on the international stage big with nismo gt 3 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:40.830
 In to be able to win so I think this is to take probably first championship in 23 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:45.470
 I'm really proud that it was written here again 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.470
 I would like to thank the Nissan rhythm in which this chansok blooms
