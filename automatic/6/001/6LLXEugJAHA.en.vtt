00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.309
 Welcome to the small world of great wonderment of the world of Herpa 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.629
 in Dietenhofen 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.980
 just 6000 inhabitants counts the small town Dannenberg and still 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.369
 Each year, they incur more cars and trucks than any big one 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.849
 Automobile companies together 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.470
 Since 1978, Hertha has been producing miniature models since the beginning 

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:29.579
 The nineties are also looking forward to the collectors of the aircraft models 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
 Innovations in a variety of scales 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.740
 The first station for a new model is the design department of Mr. Bahr 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 With the latest software, the designers reduce the original data of the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 Automobile manufacturers in scale 1 to 87 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.070
 but it is not enough just to reduce the data 87 times 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.680
 Details such as windscreen wipers or the manufacturer's logo would be no more than 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 recognize such and are therefore slightly overemphasized 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.900
 the computers of our construction are directly connected with the mold making 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.310
 is a mold is created for each individual component a special copper 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 Milled stamp 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 the machine that does that works fully automatically and can 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 that he will switch to ourselves 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.950
 when the stamp is ready he is stretched into this machine 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.430
 at the spark erosion he is under heavy current and burns down to the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.300
 Pieces from the 1st 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.630
 In a way as if stamped with an office escaped rubber pressed 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.820
 would 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.620
 Incidentally, sparks are barely visible in the spark erosion 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.760
 This is ensured by a special water bath 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 otherwise the shape would be affected 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.420
 It takes up to ten weeks to complete an injection mold 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.030
 is 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.070
 then she comes to the injection molding department and gets into the machine 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 adjusted 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 the plastic granules are heated and pressed with air bridge the mold 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.080
 but a conveyor belt lands the body in a quarter plate 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.949
 There was the first check 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.949
 only perfect parts keep coming 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.279
 even the slightest scratch ensures a sort out and once again in 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.119
 the plastic part z 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.309
 around 20 percent recycled material is used in the production of new parts 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 the assembly of the act itself takes over this automatically 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.290
 The individual parts are fanatically compressed and mounted here 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.289
 erupted 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 The finished parts now land once in the interim storage 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.079
 then if necessary they are still printed badly delivered action 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.249
 printing process 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.799
 the artwork is taken in every single reason drive and from Kampong 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.459
 printed 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.809
 In this way even the smallest parts can be printed true to detail 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.969
 individual parts of the crew of the model are additionally chromed 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.499
 a chrome foil is here with a hot stamp on the playoff fight 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.499
 so that the manufacturer's logo shines as well as the original 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.439
 v 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.439
 Almost all models of harder are assembled at home and commercial 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.439
 Check back 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
 one last reviewing look and the model ready to ship 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.379
 Every year over 4 million models are produced all over the world 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
 be sent 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:56.359
 By the way, almost all models of Herbert ever produced are available to them 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 in the adventure world of the harder museum 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.019
