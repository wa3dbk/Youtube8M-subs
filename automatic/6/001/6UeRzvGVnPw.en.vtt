on this is it actually twists from the

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.029 
on this is it actually twists from the
back<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.910> ink<00:00:40.090> is<00:00:40.239> deployed<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.890> the

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
back so the ink is deployed with the

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.520 
back so the ink is deployed with the
transmission<00:00:42.670> in<00:00:42.789> the<00:00:42.910> rear<00:00:43.090> tip<00:00:43.420> this<00:00:44.170> arrow

see it's a little bit smaller the center

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.069 
see it's a little bit smaller the center
section<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.969> little<00:00:58.210> bit<00:00:58.329> smaller<00:00:58.629> I'm<00:00:58.840> just

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
section is a little bit smaller I'm just

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.380 
section is a little bit smaller I'm just
trying<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.440> compare<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.550> mid<00:01:00.820> piece<00:01:01.120> here

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
trying to compare the the mid piece here

trying to compare the the mid piece here
you<00:01:01.510> can<00:01:01.660> see<00:01:01.809> it's<00:01:01.930> about<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.140> quarter<00:01:02.530> of<00:01:02.559> an

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
you can see it's about a quarter of an

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.570 
you can see it's about a quarter of an
inch<00:01:02.800> shorter<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.530> me<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.800> actually<00:01:05.950> looks

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
inch shorter but to me it actually looks

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.340 
inch shorter but to me it actually looks
better<00:01:06.730> it<00:01:07.240> seems<00:01:07.540> like<00:01:07.810> it's<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.080> better

there are some higher ends that just
came<00:01:35.560> out<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:36.280> far<00:01:36.550> as<00:01:36.760> higher-end<00:01:37.240> platings

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
came out as far as higher-end platings

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.990 
came out as far as higher-end platings
go<00:01:38.050> now<00:01:38.680> one<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> reasons<00:01:39.460> i<00:01:39.610> like<00:01:39.790> the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
go now one of the reasons i like the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.630 
go now one of the reasons i like the
arrow<00:01:40.180> besides<00:01:40.900> its<00:01:41.140> simplicity<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.070> its

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
arrow besides its simplicity and its

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.400 
arrow besides its simplicity and its
look<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.810> cast<00:01:44.110> ability<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.010> arrow

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
look is the cast ability of the arrow

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.230 
look is the cast ability of the arrow

how much meat is left on the tube and
what<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.820> does<00:02:01.120> when<00:02:01.390> you're<00:02:01.540> casting

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
what that does when you're casting

what that does when you're casting
something<00:02:02.590> especially<00:02:03.070> tube<00:02:03.340> on<00:02:03.550> casting<00:02:04.180> is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
something especially tube on casting is

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.050 
something especially tube on casting is
it<00:02:04.900> gives<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.230> more<00:02:05.410> room<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.800> work<00:02:05.830> with<00:02:06.060> I've

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
it gives you more room to work with I've

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.990 
it gives you more room to work with I've
had<00:02:07.270> some<00:02:08.200> other<00:02:08.440> pens<00:02:08.800> were<00:02:09.070> gone<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.910> lot

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
had some other pens were gone to a lot

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.270 
had some other pens were gone to a lot
of<00:02:10.210> work<00:02:10.479> done<00:02:10.780> some<00:02:11.020> expensive<00:02:11.620> work<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.070> them

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
of work done some expensive work on them

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.690 
of work done some expensive work on them
and<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:12.600> it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and then it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.110 
and then it
just<00:02:13.970> such<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> thin<00:02:15.040> body<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> thin<00:02:16.610> profile

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
just such a thin body and a thin profile

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.150 
just such a thin body and a thin profile
that<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.450> have<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.629> cut<00:02:17.870> down<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.500> match<00:02:18.920> up

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
that you have to cut down to to match up

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.800 
that you have to cut down to to match up
to<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> bushings<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> fittings<00:02:20.569> that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
to the bushings and the fittings that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.800 
to the bushings and the fittings that
you<00:02:21.470> cut<00:02:21.769> through<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.129> stuff<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.540> arrow

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
you cut through that stuff so the arrow

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110 
you cut through that stuff so the arrow
is<00:02:24.140> really<00:02:24.680> nice<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.760> thickness

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
is really nice because of that thickness

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.990 
is really nice because of that thickness
and<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.590> will<00:02:27.769> allow<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.730> is

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
and what that will allow you to do is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.280 
and what that will allow you to do is
cast<00:02:29.660> larger<00:02:30.440> objects<00:02:30.920> or<00:02:31.160> more<00:02:31.550> objects

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
cast larger objects or more objects

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.750 
cast larger objects or more objects
stuff<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.440> might<00:02:33.590> not<00:02:33.800> be<00:02:33.950> able<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.130> do<00:02:34.459> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
stuff you might not be able to do to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.420 
stuff you might not be able to do to
bond<00:02:34.970> casting<00:02:35.569> for<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:36.019> other<00:02:36.140> pen<00:02:36.470> kits<00:02:36.769> so

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
bond casting for in other pen kits so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.949 
bond casting for in other pen kits so
one<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.610> my<00:02:37.790> favorite<00:02:38.180> castings<00:02:38.660> with<00:02:38.840> the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
i do is curve them to the pen tube size

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
look good you don't have to do casting

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.390 
look good you don't have to do casting
