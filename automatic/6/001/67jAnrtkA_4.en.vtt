00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
if you haven't done this before you're
more<00:01:46.049> than<00:01:46.200> likely<00:01:46.259> almost<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.250> spit<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
more than likely almost just spit the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
more than likely almost just spit the
water<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.149> versus<00:01:48.990> actually<00:01:49.500> misting<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
water out versus actually misting it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
water out versus actually misting it
like<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> need<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.689> no<00:01:51.869> good<00:01:52.140> for

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like you need to do this is no good for

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.859 
like you need to do this is no good for
what<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.920> need<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.820> misted<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.570> order

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
what we need it to be is misted in order

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.130 
what we need it to be is misted in order
for<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.500> enough

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
for it to have enough

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.160 
for it to have enough
and<00:01:56.680> surface<00:01:57.130> area<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.610> combust<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.050> way

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
and surface area to combust so the way

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.020 
and surface area to combust so the way
we<00:01:59.380> achieved<00:01:59.740> this<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.130> by<00:02:00.280> keeping<00:02:00.490> our<00:02:00.820> lips

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
we achieved this is by keeping our lips

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.270 
we achieved this is by keeping our lips
very<00:02:01.360> tight<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:01.930> close<00:02:02.140> together<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.770> making

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
very tight and close together and making

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280 
very tight and close together and making
a<00:02:03.550> lip<00:02:03.790> motion<00:02:04.210> similar<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.810> blowing<00:02:05.170> a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
a lip motion similar to blowing a

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.830 
a lip motion similar to blowing a
trumpet<00:02:05.760> practice<00:02:06.760> makes<00:02:07.060> perfect<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.660> keep

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
trumpet practice makes perfect so keep

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.380 
trumpet practice makes perfect so keep
trying<00:02:08.350> until<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:08.979> achieve<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.520> nice<00:02:09.910> fine

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
trying until you can achieve a nice fine

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.930 
trying until you can achieve a nice fine
mist<00:02:10.810> even<00:02:11.440> with<00:02:11.620> almost<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.160> full<00:02:12.430> mouthful<00:02:12.910> of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
mist even with almost a full mouthful of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.480 
mist even with almost a full mouthful of
water<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.080> see<00:02:14.410> me<00:02:14.560> demonstrating<00:02:14.740> this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
water you can see me demonstrating this

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.660 
water you can see me demonstrating this
technique<00:02:15.970> right<00:02:16.360> here<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.920> also<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.370> good

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
technique right here it's also a good

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.550 
technique right here it's also a good
idea<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.240> practice<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.690> couple<00:02:20.110> times<00:02:20.380> with

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
idea to practice a couple times with

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.260 
idea to practice a couple times with
just<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.010> fuel<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.460> note<00:02:21.610> torch<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.240> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
just the fuel and note torch to get a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.210 
just the fuel and note torch to get a
feel<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> although<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:23.890> strictly

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
feel for it although it's not strictly

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.510 
feel for it although it's not strictly
necessary<00:02:25.020> now<00:02:26.020> I'm<00:02:26.230> not<00:02:26.470> going<00:02:26.800> into<00:02:27.280> making

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
necessary now I'm not going into making

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.730 
necessary now I'm not going into making
a<00:02:27.880> torch<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.570> video<00:02:28.900> as<00:02:29.290> there<00:02:29.590> are

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
a torch in this video as there are

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.040 
a torch in this video as there are
numerous<00:02:29.980> tutorials<00:02:30.340> for<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.000> online<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.959> if

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
numerous tutorials for it online but if

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.449 
numerous tutorials for it online but if
I<00:02:32.140> get<00:02:32.320> enough<00:02:32.560> requests<00:02:33.010> I'll<00:02:33.250> make<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
I get enough requests I'll make a

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.940 
I get enough requests I'll make a
separate<00:02:33.940> video<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.270> how<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.660> made<00:02:35.110> my<00:02:35.320> torch

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
separate video on how I made my torch

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.920 
separate video on how I made my torch
remember<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.880> stuff<00:02:37.090> has<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> fairly<00:02:37.750> high

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
remember the stuff has a fairly high

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.690 
remember the stuff has a fairly high
flash<00:02:38.290> point<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.830> regular<00:02:39.190> match<00:02:39.430> or<00:02:39.670> lighter

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
flash point so regular match or lighter

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.610 
flash point so regular match or lighter
won't<00:02:40.090> cut<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.900> you're<00:02:41.170> having<00:02:41.320> problems

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
won't cut it if you're having problems

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.680 
won't cut it if you're having problems
with<00:02:41.890> getting<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.280> nice<00:02:42.489> fireball<00:02:43.000> at<00:02:43.060> first<00:02:43.300> it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
with getting a nice fireball at first it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.449 
with getting a nice fireball at first it
might<00:02:43.930> be<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.140> good<00:02:44.350> idea<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.800> check<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.040> torch

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
might be a good idea to check your torch

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.160 
might be a good idea to check your torch
as<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> flame<00:02:46.090> might<00:02:46.330> need<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.600> be<00:02:46.690> bigger<00:02:46.930> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
as the flame might need to be bigger and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.430 
as the flame might need to be bigger and
more<00:02:47.590> intense<00:02:48.270> after<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.510> little<00:02:49.690> practice<00:02:49.930> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
more intense after a little practice and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.440 
more intense after a little practice and
making<00:02:50.800> sure<00:02:50.950> everything<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> go<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.270> put

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
making sure everything is a go you put

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.240 
making sure everything is a go you put
into<00:02:52.630> action<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.320> hopefully<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.950> should<00:02:53.980> get

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
into action and hopefully you should get

00:02:54.250 --> 00:06:20.010 
into action and hopefully you should get
results<00:02:54.850> like<00:02:54.910> these

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020
