00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 yeah it's time for a gaming again 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 mouse review you such a gamergeeks it went 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 away such a stupid thing to do 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.250
 this time go look at a mouse from 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 the company reader and switch 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.119
 respected name within the gaming and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 see sport here well I can't either 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.790
 different because they are more than 20 years old 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 active 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.510
 and besides that they make headsets I have 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.340
 a river of done and keyboards 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 worth another review of coming and being 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.610
 specialize in making 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 mice that's where i get it all 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 started with them at racer well 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.300
 showpiece that has the new version 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 received in the form of the tanner 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 roma because there just aren't that whole 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 many antics to this mouse 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.410
 also if just looks at the button 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.360
 layout you obviously have their left 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 mouse button you have a right mouse button 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.809
 have a mouse song that you can enter 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.719
 click as being a third mars button 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.670
 and yes for the rest you do not see whole 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.600
 much on the side you have two more 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.549
 extra buttons 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 these are set to by default 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.650
 next and previous but I myself have them 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 put on increasing or decreasing 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.570
 of you that p'li de dotz per inch or 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 how fast your cursor moves over it 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 screen for the rest you simply see 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.180
 not very good special about this mouse 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 and I think that works to his advantage 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.659
 especially when you look at the design there 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 his two lights on the mouse is one 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.799
 the super cool race a logo what I 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.659
 really really likes this market because 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.850
 it does not look like a light what 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.579
 is stuck on it or something under it 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 no it's really like it's on 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.140
 hears say it is really on it 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.950
 printed but the light is already on 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.990
 a Martian 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 is also a light of course and this can 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.399
 you get this new croma version of all sorts 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.229
 colors provide 16 million to exactly 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.700
 and you can do it a briefing 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 you can just give him an effect 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 static water and you can turn on the lights 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.540
 indicate individually for what color 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.159
 they must be and if you are another racer 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.409
 croma product there then you can for example 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.689
 set that if this mouse now go to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.459
 purple, for example, grows that other 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.240
 racer staples products do that too 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.090
 for the first time I know the design very well 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.040
 sleek simple but effective well how 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.060
 I sometimes find a lamp you see 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.440
 very greasy 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.330
 but of course if you hand heaven 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.510
 pay attention and go kema you see nothing more 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.860
 from 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.320
 but that does not mean that I have everything 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.160
 Perse certainly understands this mouse are there 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.650
 very much 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.450
 slots present especially on the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.610
 top between the mouse wheel 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 and the travel logo is such a whole line 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.240
 was around such a slit and then I think 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 what kind of fucking feature does it have 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.430
 is it below 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.130
 well distinguishable buttons 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.920
 or so well of this is that he is there 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.420
 very small dirt easily 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.890
 thingies income and this is not only 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.390
 but present on the top as well 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.480
 on the sides and even on the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.760
 backside of that very little one 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.170
 slots and you can go with your nail 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.790
 not between making it once 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.810
 peace becomes very difficult to clean 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 to make 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.750
 if this mouse is something then it is nice to 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.210
 to play with 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.550
 the feeling because this mouse offers you 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.800
 very bold but also especially unique 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.060
 needs some getting used to but if 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.130
 once you get used to it 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.440
 then you start to enjoy this and the mouse 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.420
 first of all very light that is possible 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.740
 really be seen as a disadvantage and that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.810
 really has a whole 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.400
 convex shape and a very long shape say 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.610
 but you really notice that when your hand is on it 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.260
 puts that almost up to your wrist 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.360
 on the bottom palm of your hand 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.550
 that linkedin mouse and first 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.170
 body feels very strange for sure 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.680
 for me i have gaming mouse for example 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.180
 tested 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.240
 This is the first time I have brought something like that 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.460
 markets but then you go a few potty 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.380
 games of league of legends 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.030
 and then you are already used to it 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.020
 do it wonderfully and then you don't want to 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.490
 more different 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.350
 this is also reflected on the left and 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.690
 right mouse button both are kind of 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.880
 hillocks bomblets present which 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.650
 basically your directing how you do the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.270
 keep eating things and it performs 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.190
 incredibly feyenoord there is just one 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.020
 peeling that you must have 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.320
 And that's the side of being there 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.600
 side also a kind of some rubber 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.520
 100 is also present that you grip 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.230
 improve sit in racing software 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.060
 still surprisingly many functions for one 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.650
 simplistic mouse like this you can 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.780
 of course the lights and the croma 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.209
 functions you can set what color 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.860
 or the cycle between colors what 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.220
 for effect it gives et cetera et 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.290
 cetera 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.910
 You can do the button layout of course 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.620
 change 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.570
 only the left mouse is not allowed 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.850
 I have to feel myself here 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.680
 gratefully made use of by the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.390
 sides and not on previous and next 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.490
 but that piai 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.490
 talking about a goalkeeper year this thing 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.260
 can be up to 10,000 type year so if you really 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.690
 fucking fast with your course on it 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.460
 screen then it may still be there 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.440
 separate sensitive 10 sliders that you 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.270
 can apply and through this software 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.840
 has a service scanner so you can 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.940
 your 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.920
 mouse pad you can scan and then hold 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.170
 who say take that into account very much 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.790
 fat if you like gaming companies mouse 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.250
 is going to release with not very much 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.320
 than the razr deathadder is chrome 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.710
 all really a very successful version 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.440
 of it 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.210
 I love it with this one but them 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.580
 play it really is the design 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.770
 the way you lie in your hand, yet 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.240
 already to tie paris million where you 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.860
 country can still do some things with it 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.660
 in addition , the whole looks fat 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.790
 I think lights are beautiful 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.040
 only downside it is quite a spicy 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.320
 price 70 euros orphan costs federal 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.000
 But good if you have croma and money for that 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.780
 then you really get one 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.780
 quality mouse
