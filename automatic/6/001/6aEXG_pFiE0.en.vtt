right<00:00:14.539> now<00:00:14.920> almost<00:00:15.920> have<00:00:16.340> a<00:00:16.550> few<00:00:16.730> things<00:00:16.910> in

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
right now almost have a few things in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.700 
right now almost have a few things in
common<00:00:17.090> they're<00:00:17.510> all<00:00:17.539> soft<00:00:17.990> bodies<00:00:18.380> they<00:00:18.619> have

common they're all soft bodies they have

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.109 
common they're all soft bodies they have
a<00:00:18.769> mint<00:00:19.039> let's<00:00:19.400> kind<00:00:19.699> of<00:00:19.730> like<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:19.910> protective

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
a mint let's kind of like a protective

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.689 
a mint let's kind of like a protective
covering<00:00:20.810> for<00:00:21.259> the<00:00:21.380> internal<00:00:21.830> organs<00:00:21.949> they

covering for the internal organs they

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.880 
covering for the internal organs they
all<00:00:22.789> have<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:23.000> muscular<00:00:23.810> foot<00:00:24.199> if<00:00:24.470> you<00:00:24.679> will

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
all have a muscular foot if you will

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.939 
all have a muscular foot if you will
it's<00:00:25.789> not<00:00:26.060> always<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:26.480> foot<00:00:26.810> but<00:00:26.990> it<00:00:27.050> does<00:00:27.470> cause

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
it's not always a foot but it does cause

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.249 
it's not always a foot but it does cause
motion<00:00:28.249> in<00:00:28.579> these<00:00:28.730> things<00:00:28.939> they'll<00:00:29.900> all<00:00:30.079> have

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
motion in these things they'll all have

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.470 
motion in these things they'll all have
a<00:00:30.349> shell<00:00:30.619> gills<00:00:31.519> and<00:00:31.789> an<00:00:32.029> open<00:00:32.270> circulatory

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
a shell gills and an open circulatory

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.540 
a shell gills and an open circulatory
system<00:00:33.140> this<00:00:33.290> doesn't<00:00:33.590> mean<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.400> can

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
system this doesn't mean that you can

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.010 
system this doesn't mean that you can
open<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:34.940> close<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.210> circulatory<00:00:35.600> system

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
open and close the circulatory system

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.529 
open and close the circulatory system
like<00:00:36.199> you<00:00:36.469> want<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.039> blood<00:00:37.250> falls<00:00:37.520> up<00:00:37.699> no<00:00:37.940> this

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
like you want and blood falls up no this

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.150 
like you want and blood falls up no this
just<00:00:38.570> means<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.079> blood<00:00:39.410> will<00:00:39.680> leave<00:00:39.949> the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
just means that blood will leave the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160 
just means that blood will leave the
circulatory<00:00:40.609> system<00:00:41.180> temporarily<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.960> flow

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
circulatory system temporarily to flow

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.010 
circulatory system temporarily to flow
into<00:00:42.289> other<00:00:42.530> organs<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.609> have<00:00:44.180> nutrients<00:00:44.840> and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
into other organs to have nutrients and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.750 
into other organs to have nutrients and
other<00:00:45.320> materials<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:45.920> fuse<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.430> out<00:00:46.520> of<00:00:46.640> it

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
other materials to fuse in and out of it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.430 
other materials to fuse in and out of it
and<00:00:46.879> then<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.390> will<00:00:47.510> reenter<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.960> circulatory

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
and then it will reenter the circulatory

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.759 
and then it will reenter the circulatory
system<00:00:48.820> alright<00:00:49.820> mosques<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.780> general<00:00:51.109> right

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
system alright mosques in general right

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.380 
system alright mosques in general right
there<00:00:51.980> now<00:00:52.670> we're<00:00:52.789> going<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:52.969> start<00:00:53.090> looking

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
there now we're going to start looking

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.810 
there now we're going to start looking
at<00:00:53.480> some<00:00:53.690> more<00:00:54.109> specific<00:00:55.010> examples<00:00:55.489> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
at some more specific examples the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.360 
at some more specific examples the
gastropod<00:00:56.239> first<00:00:56.690> this<00:00:57.379> literally<00:00:58.129> means

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
gastropod first this literally means

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.750 
gastropod first this literally means
stomach<00:00:59.059> foot<00:00:59.300> why<00:00:59.949> because<00:01:00.949> if<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.489> look<00:01:01.609> at

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
stomach foot why because if you look at

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.600 
stomach foot why because if you look at
a<00:01:01.789> gastropod<00:01:02.179> snails<00:01:02.780> slugs<00:01:03.019> whatever<00:01:03.679> the

a gastropod snails slugs whatever the

a gastropod snails slugs whatever the

do it foot is in fact here's a diagram

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.020 
do it foot is in fact here's a diagram
of<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.640> snail<00:01:11.680> down<00:01:12.680> here<00:01:13.010> we<00:01:13.760> have<00:01:13.910> the

and if it does have a shell it will have

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
exceptions to the shell rule this is one

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.470 
exceptions to the shell rule this is one
all<00:01:37.220> right<00:01:37.430> next<00:01:38.120> up<00:01:38.830> five<00:01:39.830> outs<00:01:40.300> things<00:01:41.300> like

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
all right next up five outs things like

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.190 
all right next up five outs things like
clams<00:01:42.340> these<00:01:43.340> have<00:01:43.730> two<00:01:44.000> shells<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.840> foot

clams these have two shells and the foot

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.140 
clams these have two shells and the foot
is<00:01:45.440> what<00:01:45.590> holds<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.950> shelves<00:01:46.250> together<00:01:46.430> now

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
is what holds the shelves together now

is what holds the shelves together now
generally<00:01:47.510> this<00:01:47.660> means<00:01:47.840> very<00:01:48.140> tightly

foot<00:02:03.350> has<00:02:03.380> become<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:04.100> tentacle<00:02:04.490> thing<00:02:04.940> that

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
foot has become this tentacle thing that

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.880 
foot has become this tentacle thing that
is<00:02:05.480> used<00:02:05.660> for<00:02:05.780> jet<00:02:06.050> propulsion<00:02:06.350> what<00:02:06.740> they'll

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
is used for jet propulsion what they'll

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.830 
is used for jet propulsion what they'll
do<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.490> they'll<00:02:07.790> bring<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.210> tendons<00:02:08.509> up<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
do is they'll bring the tendons up and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.270 
do is they'll bring the tendons up and
then<00:02:09.020> bring<00:02:09.259> them<00:02:09.350> together<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.130> that

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
that's because they have actually

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740 
that's because they have actually
changed<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.760> way<00:03:26.060> their<00:03:26.239> feet<00:03:26.420> work<00:03:26.600> to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
changed the way their feet work to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.420 
changed the way their feet work to
become<00:03:26.900> slightly<00:03:27.230> tentacle<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.010> that's<00:03:28.190> near

become slightly tentacle and that's near

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.520 
become slightly tentacle and that's near
the<00:03:28.549> head<00:03:28.730> they<00:03:29.570> can<00:03:29.750> move<00:03:29.930> through<00:03:30.260> Jet
