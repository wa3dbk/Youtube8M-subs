time uh you know what class turtle you
so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> could<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> video<00:00:38.340> put<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.790> the

toughness<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.130> use<00:01:32.220> toughness

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
toughness if you don't use toughness

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
toughness if you don't use toughness
used<00:01:32.820> softness<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> game<00:01:33.450> ah<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.960> next

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
used softness of the game ah the next

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
used softness of the game ah the next
thing<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> skills<00:01:34.799> killstreaks<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.579> would

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
thing for the skills killstreaks I would

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
thing for the skills killstreaks I would
say<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:37.040> important<00:01:38.040> part<00:01:38.250> okay

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
say this is a very important part okay

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
say this is a very important part okay
so<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.850> use<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> system<00:01:39.360> hack<00:01:39.600> there's<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so you use the system hack there's a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
so you use the system hack there's a
1200<00:01:40.950> point<00:01:41.159> system<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> ques<00:01:41.790> disabled<00:01:42.180> XO<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
1200 point system a ques disabled XO and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
1200 point system a ques disabled XO and
double<00:01:43.290> extended<00:01:43.799> time<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.759> reason<00:01:45.000> why<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
double extended time the reason why you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
double extended time the reason why you
use<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> basically<00:01:46.049> disabled<00:01:46.530> deck<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
use this is basically disabled deck so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.630 
use this is basically disabled deck so
that<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.950> could<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.189> able<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> jump<00:01:47.520> double

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that I could be able to jump double

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.800 
that I could be able to jump double
extent<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.180> means<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.540> literally

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
extent in time means they literally

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
extent in time means they literally
can't<00:01:49.170> jump<00:01:49.409> 442nd<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> try<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.549> da

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can't jump 442nd so if you try to get da

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.730 
can't jump 442nd so if you try to get da
bombs<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.420> jump<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> roof<00:01:52.079> jump<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
bombs you know jump up on a roof jump on

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.649 
bombs you know jump up on a roof jump on
a<00:01:52.770> cliff<00:01:53.070> jump<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.759> wherever<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> hell<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
a cliff jump on wherever the hell you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.270 
a cliff jump on wherever the hell you
could<00:01:54.780> jump<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.200> use<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:56.100> they

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
could jump on use this thing they

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.429 
could jump on use this thing they
literally<00:01:56.579> cannot<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.509> absolutely

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
literally cannot get to you absolutely

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
literally cannot get to you absolutely
amazing<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.100> UAV<00:01:59.399> 850<00:01:59.969> points<00:02:00.210> for

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
amazing that on my UAV 850 points for

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
amazing that on my UAV 850 points for
that<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.659> use<00:02:00.840> speed<00:02:01.170> extra<00:02:01.530> time<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.799> threat

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that I use speed extra time in threat

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.649 
that I use speed extra time in threat
detection<00:02:02.189> basically<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.360> them<00:02:03.509> through

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
detection basically you see them through

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.780 
detection basically you see them through
the<00:02:03.750> walls<00:02:03.990> speed<00:02:04.979> enables<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the walls speed enables you to see it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.609 
the walls speed enables you to see it
basically<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.659> soon<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.200> disappear

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
basically like as soon as they disappear

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.199 
basically like as soon as they disappear
they<00:02:07.770> come<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:08.729> awesome<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
they come back on so that's awesome and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.729 
they come back on so that's awesome and
an<00:02:09.360> extra<00:02:09.599> time<00:02:09.780> obviously<00:02:09.959> last<00:02:10.349> August<00:02:10.679> so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
an extra time obviously last August so

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.380 
an extra time obviously last August so
normally<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.760> your<00:02:11.879> kills<00:02:12.120> get

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
normally you can get your kills get

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.650 
normally you can get your kills get
another<00:02:12.629> one<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> these<00:02:12.930> by<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> time<00:02:13.410> I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
another one of these by the time I

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.940 
another one of these by the time I
now<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.050> whole<00:02:14.260> time<00:02:14.500> you're<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.770> see<00:02:14.890> in

now in the whole time you're to see in

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.170 
now in the whole time you're to see in
the<00:02:15.010> enemy<00:02:15.250> through<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.490> wall<00:02:15.640> that's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the enemy through the wall that's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.210
