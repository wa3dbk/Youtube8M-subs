00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.170
 The storm is coming 

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.290
 Sounds like you are looking forward to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.762
 I am just very comfortable with it. 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.334
 What the hell are you? 

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.702
 I am Gotham's retribution. 

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.257
 Did they kill him? 

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.591
 I am not sure 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.496
 Why don't you just kill me? 

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.999
 Your punishment must be more ferocious 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.601
 Hope no longer 

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.370
 Do you think he will come back? 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.700
 I do not know 

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.679
 Why are you going to escape? Because Bane? 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.949
 You should be afraid of him like me. 

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.510
 Faith collapse 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.153
 I won't let you go first. 

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.910
 I have died with too many Wayne family members. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Bonfire will start 

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.998
 You donâ€™t owe them anymore. 

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.270
 You have given everything for them. 

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.508
 Nothing, no yet 

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.413
 Epic end 

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.351
 Dark Knight Legend 

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:08.194
 Dark Knight: Dawn rises 

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.498
 My mother warned me that I can't just go to a stranger's car. 

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.799
 This is not a car
