first of all you're gonna need the
battle<00:00:23.980> display<00:00:24.310> which<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:24.579> just<00:00:24.759> got<00:00:24.880> past

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
battle display which I just got past

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.050 
battle display which I just got past
cost<00:00:25.660> grenade<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:26.290> cryo<00:00:26.710> foam<00:00:27.040> from<00:00:27.849> the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
cost grenade and cryo foam from the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.540 
cost grenade and cryo foam from the
first<00:00:28.570> tree<00:00:28.810> which<00:00:29.110> I<00:00:29.259> do<00:00:29.320> their<00:00:29.800> tactics<00:00:30.340> tree

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
first tree which I do their tactics tree

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.700 
first tree which I do their tactics tree
and<00:00:30.820> from<00:00:31.450> devices<00:00:31.750> you're<00:00:32.259> gonna<00:00:32.349> need<00:00:32.559> the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
and from devices you're gonna need the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.540 
and from devices you're gonna need the
vortex<00:00:33.160> cannon<00:00:34.170> distract<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.590> then

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
vortex cannon distract and then

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.890 
vortex cannon distract and then
obviously<00:00:36.850> em<00:00:37.750> people's<00:00:39.120> EMP<00:00:40.120> pulse<00:00:40.150> is<00:00:40.570> way

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
obviously em people's EMP pulse is way

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.610 
obviously em people's EMP pulse is way
better<00:00:41.080> than<00:00:41.380> the<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.270> paralyzing<00:00:43.750> dart<00:00:44.140> by

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
better than the the paralyzing dart by

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.190 
better than the the paralyzing dart by
about<00:00:45.190> twice<00:00:46.060> it<00:00:46.360> does<00:00:46.480> about<00:00:46.690> twice<00:00:46.900> as<00:00:47.080> much

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
about twice it does about twice as much

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.370 
about twice it does about twice as much
damage<00:00:47.470> so<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.850> loadout<00:00:49.150> is<00:00:49.360> gas<00:00:49.690> grenade<00:00:50.020> Carl

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
damage so my loadout is gas grenade Carl

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.510 
damage so my loadout is gas grenade Carl
Foam<00:00:52.079> vortex<00:00:53.079> cannon<00:00:53.380> which<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.310> gonna<00:00:54.430> be

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
Foam vortex cannon which is gonna be

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.710 
Foam vortex cannon which is gonna be

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
you're gonna do that in the EMP pulse in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890 
you're gonna do that in the EMP pulse in
to<00:01:11.650> distract<00:01:12.190> because<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.300> order<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.570> get<00:01:13.690> in
