slipping<00:00:28.310> on<00:00:28.430> ice<00:00:28.520> motion<00:00:30.640> you'll<00:00:31.640> see<00:00:31.850> that

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
slipping on ice motion you'll see that

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.759 
slipping on ice motion you'll see that

my motion skeleton will appear after I

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.889 
my motion skeleton will appear after I
open<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:34.249> and<00:00:34.399> I<00:00:34.789> can<00:00:34.969> play<00:00:35.149> back<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.629> review

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899

library<00:00:40.159> on<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.339> right<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:40.940> can<00:00:41.059> import<00:00:41.510> in<00:00:41.659> my

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
library on the right I can import in my

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.779 
library on the right I can import in my
other<00:00:41.989> motion<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:42.649> just<00:00:43.219> double<00:00:43.399> click<00:00:43.670> on

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
other motion and just double click on

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.869 
other motion and just double click on
that<00:00:43.969> one<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.359> preview<00:00:44.719> it<00:00:44.839> as<00:00:45.019> well

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.309 

everything<00:00:49.879> looks<00:00:49.909> good<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.269> far<00:00:50.690> but<00:00:51.019> the

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
everything looks good so far but the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:52.779 
everything looks good so far but the
only<00:00:51.469> problem<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.979> that<00:00:52.039> we<00:00:52.249> don't<00:00:52.399> have<00:00:52.579> an

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
only problem is that we don't have an

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.119 
only problem is that we don't have an
actual<00:00:53.149> T<00:00:53.449> pose<00:00:53.659> yet<00:00:53.929> which<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.620> required<00:00:54.979> for

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
actual T pose yet which is required for

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.489 
actual T pose yet which is required for
correct<00:00:55.579> animation<00:00:56.120> results<00:00:59.229> therefore<00:01:00.229> I

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
correct animation results therefore I

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.020 
correct animation results therefore I
can't<00:01:00.979> convert<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.519> non-standard

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
can't convert to a non-standard

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.090 
can't convert to a non-standard
character<00:01:02.569> yet<00:01:02.780> as<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:03.079> don't<00:01:03.139> have<00:01:03.440> my<00:01:03.620> T<00:01:03.679> pose

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
character yet as I don't have my T pose

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.790 
character yet as I don't have my T pose
as<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.339> reference<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.780> let's<00:01:06.080> create<00:01:06.350> one<00:01:06.440> then

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
as a reference so let's create one then

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.400 
as a reference so let's create one then
I'm<00:01:07.520> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.910> select<00:01:08.060> my<00:01:08.300> waving<00:01:08.780> motion<00:01:08.960> and

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
I'm going to select my waving motion and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.620 
I'm going to select my waving motion and
then<00:01:09.710> switch<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:09.980> orthogonal<00:01:10.760> view<00:01:10.970> which<00:01:11.510> is

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
then switch to orthogonal view which is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.540 
then switch to orthogonal view which is
ideal<00:01:11.960> for<00:01:12.020> setting<00:01:12.500> up<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.710> T<00:01:12.890> pose<00:01:13.130> due<00:01:13.430> to

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
ideal for setting up the T pose due to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.000 
ideal for setting up the T pose due to
its<00:01:13.700> ability<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.210> view<00:01:14.600> from<00:01:14.840> absolute<00:01:15.320> angles

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.230 

next<00:01:19.010> I<00:01:19.100> want<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.310> move<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.610> timeline<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.210> a

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
next I want to move the timeline to a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.610 
next I want to move the timeline to a
random<00:01:20.660> point<00:01:20.840> during<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.290> animation<00:01:23.440> if<00:01:24.440> I

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
random point during the animation if I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.500 
random point during the animation if I
select<00:01:24.980> convert<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.460> non-standard<00:01:26.150> right<00:01:26.330> now

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
select convert to non-standard right now

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.420 
select convert to non-standard right now
the<00:01:27.140> bones<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.530> keep<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:27.920> pose<00:01:28.160> after

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
the bones will keep this pose after

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.130 
the bones will keep this pose after
entering<00:01:28.940> into<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.300> characterized<00:01:29.900> mode

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
entering into the characterized mode

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.750 
entering into the characterized mode
which<00:01:30.740> isn't<00:01:30.980> what<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.250> want

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
which isn't what I want

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.450 
which isn't what I want
so<00:01:32.000> I'll<00:01:32.210> cancel<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.660> for<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.050> I<00:01:33.350> want<00:01:34.340> to

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
so I'll cancel that for now I want to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.700 
so I'll cancel that for now I want to
select<00:01:34.700> my<00:01:34.910> motion<00:01:35.270> again<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.840> go<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.410> point

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
select my motion again and go to a point

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.680 
select my motion again and go to a point
where<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.070> pose<00:01:37.310> seems<00:01:37.670> fairly<00:01:37.970> symmetrical

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
where the pose seems fairly symmetrical

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.170 
where the pose seems fairly symmetrical
and<00:01:39.290> can<00:01:39.440> be<00:01:39.560> more<00:01:39.770> easily<00:01:39.890> modified<00:01:40.580> into<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.940> T

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
and can be more easily modified into a T

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.900 
and can be more easily modified into a T
pose<00:01:44.770> now<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.800> can<00:01:46.130> select<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.520> convert<00:01:46.880> to

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
pose now I can select the convert to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.000 
pose now I can select the convert to
non-standard<00:01:47.630> button<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.140> choose<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.860> my

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
non-standard button and choose the my

which<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.470> what<00:01:51.710> these<00:01:51.860> motions<00:01:52.280> are<00:01:52.370> based<00:01:52.580> on

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.870 

you'll<00:01:56.679> see<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.070> all<00:01:57.249> the<00:01:57.399> bones<00:01:57.609> will<00:01:57.819> be

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you'll see that all the bones will be

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
you'll see that all the bones will be
mapped<00:01:58.119> right<00:01:58.420> away

thing<00:02:02.409> I<00:02:02.499> want<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.770> do<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.130> rotate<00:02:03.340> my<00:02:03.640> arms

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
thing I want to do is rotate my arms

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.450 
thing I want to do is rotate my arms
outwards<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.630> form<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.020> T<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.590> make<00:02:06.310> sure

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
outwards to form the T and make sure

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.160 
outwards to form the T and make sure
that<00:02:06.609> all<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.789> my<00:02:07.000> arm<00:02:07.210> sections<00:02:07.719> run<00:02:07.929> parallel

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
that all of my arm sections run parallel
