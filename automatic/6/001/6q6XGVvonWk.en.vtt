but<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.220> gather<00:00:20.480> like

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
but from what I can gather like

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.540 
but from what I can gather like
ninety-five<00:00:22.199> percent<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.590> people<00:00:22.740> absolutely

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
ninety-five percent of people absolutely

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.839 
ninety-five percent of people absolutely
hate<00:00:24.269> high<00:00:25.080> school<00:00:25.220> but<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> issue<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.670> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
when you're in high school I guess now

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.939

qualities<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.669> me<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.420> they're<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.989> any<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
qualities for me but they're not any of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.549 
qualities for me but they're not any of
the<00:00:35.100> good<00:00:35.280> ones<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.090> share

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
the good ones that we share

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.049 
the good ones that we share
unfortunately<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.030> high

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
unfortunately and when I was in high

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.600 
unfortunately and when I was in high
school<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.750> thought<00:00:40.290> high<00:00:40.530> school<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
school I thought high school was it the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.080 
school I thought high school was it the
entire<00:00:42.030> world<00:00:42.980> revolves<00:00:43.980> around<00:00:43.980> those<00:00:44.520> four

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
entire world revolves around those four

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.290 
entire world revolves around those four
walls<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.020> resided<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.300> nothing

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
walls that we resided in and nothing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
walls that we resided in and nothing
else<00:00:48.570> mattered<00:00:49.079> except<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.039> everything<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
else mattered except for everything that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.880 
else mattered except for everything that
was<00:00:50.730> happening<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.530> seems<00:00:52.829> like

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
was happening in there and it seems like

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.560 
was happening in there and it seems like
the<00:00:53.070> end<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> world<00:00:53.699> any<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.329> something

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the end of the world any time something

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600 
the end of the world any time something
goes<00:00:54.840> wrong<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.770> more<00:00:55.980> concerned<00:00:56.010> with

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
goes wrong I was more concerned with

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.189 
goes wrong I was more concerned with
wearing<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> coolest<00:00:57.390> clothes<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.899> friends
