00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.050
 peace prize was our first game 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.230
 Nastya who got the right 5 of course 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 According to 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.189
 to 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.199
 to previously reported prime tass 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 and if you take the administration 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 by obama 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.490
 but we hope on the ground 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.220
 but so is the graveyard 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.780
 and under local government 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 what does rubles mean 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.010
 but I can not believe 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 so if 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.440
 two tourists 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 respectively 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 in my opinion 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 according to blue experts 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 the lines 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.240
 leading technical 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 symbolic 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.909
 ten 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 then or now 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.749
 Chinese restaurant 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.039
 and hair 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.429
 our French have become the strongest compositions 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:54.299
 teams 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.299
 and he deserved 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.939
 own fault
