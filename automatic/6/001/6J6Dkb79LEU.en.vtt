00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that is pretty much the concept of this

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
that is pretty much the concept of this
episode<00:01:52.710> that's<00:01:52.890> exactly<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.850> we

other things going on the workings in

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.730 
other things going on the workings in
the<00:02:00.420> background<00:02:00.840> pretty<00:02:01.079> much<00:02:01.259> setting<00:02:01.619> up

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the background pretty much setting up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.959 
the background pretty much setting up
for<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.280> happen<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
for what is going to happen in the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.330 
for what is going to happen in the
future<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> most<00:02:04.590> part<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> episode

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
future and for the most part the episode

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
future and for the most part the episode
is<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.520> slow<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.420> will<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.899> honest<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is very slow I will be honest the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
is very slow I will be honest the
episode<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.950> slow<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.550> there's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
episode is very slow and there's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.010 
episode is very slow and there's
actually<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> lack<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.200> action

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
actually a lack of action

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.450 
actually a lack of action
in<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.350> episode<00:02:11.710> which<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.040> quite

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
in this episode which is quite

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.160 
in this episode which is quite
surprising<00:02:12.640> because<00:02:13.210> if<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.720> about<00:02:13.870> it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
surprising because if you think about it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.140 
surprising because if you think about it
I<00:02:14.350> remember<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.100> last<00:02:15.490> review<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.000> did

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
I remember in the last review I did

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.960 
I remember in the last review I did
literally<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.200> last<00:02:17.230> review<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.100> said<00:02:18.730> that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
literally in the last review I said that

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.910 
literally in the last review I said that
it<00:02:19.150> feels<00:02:19.390> like<00:02:19.600> all<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> Noah's<00:02:20.170> 0<00:02:20.380> season<00:02:20.770> 2

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
it feels like all the Noah's 0 season 2

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.650 
it feels like all the Noah's 0 season 2
has<00:02:21.040> been<00:02:21.100> nothing<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.580> action<00:02:22.270> every<00:02:22.630> single

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
has been nothing but action every single

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.110 
has been nothing but action every single
episode<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.860> Alden<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.370> 0<00:02:24.550> season<00:02:24.970> 1

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
episode and in Alden I was 0 season 1

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.810 
episode and in Alden I was 0 season 1
there<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:26.080> some<00:02:26.680> episodes<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.460> actually

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
there was some episodes that actually

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.700 
there was some episodes that actually
took<00:02:28.030> away<00:02:28.300> from<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.660> action<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.350> gave<00:02:29.530> us

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
took away from the action and gave us

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.410 
took away from the action and gave us
you<00:02:29.860> know<00:02:29.980> character<00:02:30.760> development<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.330> know

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it took the time to actually do

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.380 
it took the time to actually do
something<00:02:54.100> like<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.820> episode<00:02:55.270> for

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
something like this so the episode for

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.270 
something like this so the episode for
the<00:02:55.480> majority<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.140> could<00:02:56.530> see<00:02:56.710> how<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.920> might<00:02:57.100> be

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
the majority I could see how it might be

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.340 
the majority I could see how it might be
boring<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:58.000> some<00:02:58.300> because<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:58.930> you're<00:02:59.050> used<00:02:59.230> to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
boring to some because if you're used to

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.680 
boring to some because if you're used to
action<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.040> old<00:03:00.190> anno<00:03:00.400> zero'<00:03:00.430> most<00:03:01.360> likely

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
action in old anno zero' most likely

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.850 
action in old anno zero' most likely
this<00:03:01.780> episode<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.410> bore<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.710> fuck

but majority of the episode was just

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.620

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
a very very simple episode like in a hoe

a very very simple episode like in a hoe
we<00:03:33.670> find<00:03:34.000> out<00:03:34.320> he<00:03:35.320> actually<00:03:35.530> has<00:03:36.459> modified

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
we find out he actually has modified

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.050 
we find out he actually has modified
that<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.630> like<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.770> he's<00:03:38.980> put<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.250> pretty

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
that I like in that he's put in pretty

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.540 
that I like in that he's put in pretty
much<00:03:40.240> he<00:03:40.420> modified<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:41.140> eye<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.860> expanded

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
much he modified that eye and expanded

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.250 
much he modified that eye and expanded
it<00:03:42.670> somewhat<00:03:43.060> where<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.360> can<00:03:43.480> actually<00:03:43.630> affect

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
it somewhat where it can actually affect

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.740 
it somewhat where it can actually affect
his<00:03:44.740> brain<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:45.370> he<00:03:45.490> goes<00:03:45.700> too<00:03:45.910> far<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.390> so

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
his brain if he goes too far with it so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.530 
his brain if he goes too far with it so
in<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.680> home<00:03:47.890> like<00:03:48.550> oh<00:03:48.700> god<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.150> that's<00:03:49.360> gonna

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
in a home like oh god that that's gonna

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.300 
in a home like oh god that that's gonna
be<00:03:49.720> some<00:03:50.050> dangerous<00:03:50.380> shit<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.010> future

like<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.459> that's<00:03:51.790> definitely<00:03:51.940> not<00:03:52.209> some

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
like that that's definitely not some

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.410 
like that that's definitely not some
obvious<00:03:52.810> foreshadowing<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.770> death<00:03:54.010> flag

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
obvious foreshadowing for a death flag

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.300 
obvious foreshadowing for a death flag
because<00:03:55.420> Anna<00:03:55.900> Howe<00:03:56.110> has<00:03:56.380> experienced<00:03:57.160> some

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
weird shit going on with his brain like

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.449 
weird shit going on with his brain like
he's<00:03:59.230> been<00:03:59.410> acting<00:03:59.860> different<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.340> know

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
he's been acting different you know

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
and he used to and so I feel like that

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.180 
and he used to and so I feel like that
overall<00:04:04.870> brain<00:04:05.170> thing<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.680> was<00:04:05.770> introduced

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
overall brain thing that was introduced

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.229 
overall brain thing that was introduced
or<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.400> know<00:04:06.490> talking<00:04:06.790> about<00:04:06.820> this<00:04:07.000> episode

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
or you know talking about this episode

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.670 
or you know talking about this episode
how<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.720> possibly<00:04:08.020> affect<00:04:08.290> his<00:04:08.410> brain

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
how it to possibly affect his brain

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.860 
how it to possibly affect his brain
before<00:04:08.830> he<00:04:09.070> realizes<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.700> I'm<00:04:10.300> willing<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.660> bet

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
before he realizes it I'm willing to bet

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.910 
before he realizes it I'm willing to bet
it's<00:04:11.020> already<00:04:11.200> starting<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.500> affect<00:04:11.800> his

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
it's already starting to affect his

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.470 
it's already starting to affect his
brain<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.400> that's<00:04:12.580> probably<00:04:12.880> what<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.239> going

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
brain and that's probably what is going

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.990 
brain and that's probably what is going
on<00:04:13.600> here<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.020> obvious<00:04:14.590> death<00:04:14.800> lag<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.280> obvious

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
on here so obvious death lag is obvious

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.349 
on here so obvious death lag is obvious
so<00:04:16.440> past<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:18.549> also<00:04:18.730> have<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.330> where

so past that you also have it to where

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.420 
so past that you also have it to where
