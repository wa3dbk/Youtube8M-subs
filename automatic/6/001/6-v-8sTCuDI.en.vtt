 Hello, welcome to my channel crazy4veggie in nehel and i 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.360
 In today's masala tea maker 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.400
 Tea is made in many ways, it is very easy to make tea in today. 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.800
 If you do not have stomach tea everyday, you do not have to buy tea masala to drink a grave. 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.200
 I have my tepale and I will pour water in it. 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.220
 I prefer half the amount of water and half the milk in tea. 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.780
 So in here it will pour half a cup of water. 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.200
 And now do the gas. 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.680
 Now one spoon of boiling water and one spoon of sugar will pour in boiling water. 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.100
 By the time tea is boiling, then we grind fresh tea masala. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.300
 I have some standing spices like 1 cardamom, 1 small piece of cinnamon, 2 cloves and 2 black peppers 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.100
 They have to grind us 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.160
 Tea is boiling on a low flame for 2 minutes. 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.040
 Now we will have half a cup of milk in it. 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.340
 And now in the fresh pisa tea masala will pour. 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:48.840
 Adjust the amount of milk by its type. If full fat milk is half a cup or more and 2% or fat free, add more 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.140
 Our tea is ready now 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:09.040
 After the tea came up, let me cook it for 2-3 minutes.
