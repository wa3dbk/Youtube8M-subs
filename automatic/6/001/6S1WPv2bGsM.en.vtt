before<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.479> print<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> print

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
before you you print them when you print

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
before you you print them when you print
these<00:01:26.369> images<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:27.509> shrink<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> when

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
these images they will shrink and when

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.120 
these images they will shrink and when

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
dark are going to press even darker and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
dark are going to press even darker and
it<00:01:40.710> might<00:01:40.890> end<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.280> looking<00:01:41.520> black<00:01:41.840> um

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it might end up just looking black um

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
it might end up just looking black um
you<00:01:43.140> will<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.380> look<00:01:43.590> appealing<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you will not look appealing and you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.840 
you will not look appealing and you
won't<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> those<00:01:45.659> nice<00:01:45.840> vibrant<00:01:46.200> colors<00:01:46.850> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
guys have um again I do this in GIMP and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.770 
guys have um again I do this in GIMP and
you<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.370> put<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> brightness<00:02:20.090> up<00:02:20.270> by<00:02:20.510> about

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
you just put the brightness up by about

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.040 
you just put the brightness up by about
50%<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.830> until<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.970> sync<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.540> still<00:02:23.750> looks<00:02:23.900> too

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
50% or until you sync it still looks too

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.080 
50% or until you sync it still looks too
dark<00:02:24.080> after<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.640> lighten<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:25.940> some

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
dark after that you can lighten it some

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.900 
dark after that you can lighten it some
more<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.950> it's<00:02:28.070> really<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.520> making<00:02:28.670> sure

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
more but it's really just making sure

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.260 
more but it's really just making sure
your<00:02:29.270> items<00:02:29.540> don't<00:02:29.750> shrink<00:02:30.020> too<00:02:30.230> dark<00:02:30.970> um<00:02:31.970> so

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270

they run about thirteen dollars at
Michaels<00:02:59.420> however<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.020> use<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.739> forty<00:03:01.250> or<00:03:01.400> fifty

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
Michaels however I use a forty or fifty

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.220 
Michaels however I use a forty or fifty
percent<00:03:01.940> off<00:03:02.060> coupon<00:03:02.300> when<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.690> purchase<00:03:03.050> them

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
percent off coupon when I purchase them

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
always recommend doing a test print on

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.690 
always recommend doing a test print on
just<00:03:47.060> regular<00:03:47.239> computer<00:03:47.870> paper<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:49.579> then

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
just regular computer paper and then

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.600 
just regular computer paper and then
