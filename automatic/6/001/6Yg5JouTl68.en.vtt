LFS<00:00:07.890> shifter<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.490> program<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.120> made<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
LFS shifter is a program I made for the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.650 
LFS shifter is a program I made for the
game<00:00:09.900> live<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.410> speed<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.150> what<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.240> does<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
game live for speed and what it does is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.950 
game live for speed and what it does is
basically<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.320> changes<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.210> game<00:00:15.420> shifts

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
basically it changes how the game shifts

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.070 
basically it changes how the game shifts
your<00:00:16.500> car<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:17.480> some<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.690> us<00:00:18.840> might<00:00:19.050> have

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
your car as some of us might have

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.439 
your car as some of us might have
noticed<00:00:19.740> many<00:00:20.100> games<00:00:20.490> tend<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:22.279> the

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
noticed many games tend to not have the

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.290 
noticed many games tend to not have the
shifting<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.689> our<00:00:25.050> normal<00:00:25.830> daily<00:00:26.400> cars<00:00:26.910> have

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
shifting that our normal daily cars have

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
shifting that our normal daily cars have
so<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.039> kind<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> shifting<00:00:29.609> I'm

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
so that is the kind of shifting I'm

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640 
so that is the kind of shifting I'm
talking<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.109> kind<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.439> cars

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
talking about here is the kind of cars

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.160 
talking about here is the kind of cars
you<00:00:31.769> drive<00:00:31.920> around<00:00:32.099> town<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.989> ones

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you drive around town you know the ones

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.880 
you drive around town you know the ones
that<00:00:34.380> don't<00:00:35.219> shift<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.149> maximum<00:00:36.690> rpm<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.770> know

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
that don't shift at maximum rpm you know

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
that don't shift at maximum rpm you know
I<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.969> I've<00:00:39.360> never<00:00:39.620> heard<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.680> anything

do realize this game is a racing game

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.799 
do realize this game is a racing game
but<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:47.670> doesn't<00:00:47.910> mean<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.420> race

I'll give you a little demonstration of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
I'll give you a little demonstration of
me<00:01:09.869> driving<00:01:10.260> around<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> shifter<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
me driving around with the shifter and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
me driving around with the shifter and
keep<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.790> mind<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.180> shifting<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
keep in mind I'm not shifting at all you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
keep in mind I'm not shifting at all you
know<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.979> shifter<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.369> doing<00:01:14.610> Austin<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:15.420> me

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
know the shifter is doing Austin not me

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
know the shifter is doing Austin not me
so<00:01:16.250> let's<00:01:17.250> start<00:01:17.580> off<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.909> economic<00:01:18.570> mode

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.480 

so<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.870> you<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.260> economic<00:01:37.560> mode<00:01:38.010> keeps<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so as you see economic mode keeps the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030 
so as you see economic mode keeps the
RPMs<00:01:38.970> low<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.500> would<00:01:40.650> expect

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
RPMs low and it's what you would expect

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.820 
RPMs low and it's what you would expect
from<00:01:41.190> any<00:01:41.400> normal<00:01:42.200> streetcar<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.740> know

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
from any normal streetcar you know

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.280 
from any normal streetcar you know
driving<00:01:44.190> around<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> city<00:01:44.840> doing<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:46.080> daily

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
driving around the city doing your daily

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.000 
driving around the city doing your daily
things<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.430> whatever<00:01:47.550> so<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.690> good<00:01:48.900> for

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
things or whatever so this is good for

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.790 
things or whatever so this is good for
just<00:01:50.010> driving<00:01:50.520> around<00:01:50.640> taking<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.300> time<00:01:51.800> now

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
just driving around taking your time now

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.510 
just driving around taking your time now
as<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.560> demand<00:01:56.130> some

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
as you see as you do demand some

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:13.599 
as you see as you do demand some
throttle<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.300> RPMs<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.229> raise

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.819 

okay<00:02:14.609> this<00:02:14.849> time<00:02:14.879> I'll<00:02:15.329> give<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.719> a<00:02:15.989> bit<00:02:16.799> more

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
okay this time I'll give it a bit more

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:44.380 
okay this time I'll give it a bit more
throttle

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:03:11.289 

and<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:46.470> time<00:02:46.739> I'm<00:02:46.980> gonna<00:02:47.220> floor<00:02:47.849> it

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.030 

there<00:03:12.299> is<00:03:12.390> also<00:03:12.599> an<00:03:12.870> alternative<00:03:13.470> mode<00:03:13.709> called

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
there is also an alternative mode called

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.130 
there is also an alternative mode called
sport<00:03:14.459> mode<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.480> does<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.900> keep

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
sport mode and what that does is keep

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.740 
sport mode and what that does is keep
your<00:03:16.290> rpms<00:03:16.769> higher<00:03:17.099> for<00:03:18.000> different<00:03:18.329> driving

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
your rpms higher for different driving

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
your rpms higher for different driving
situations<00:03:19.379> like<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.739> want<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.010> kind<00:03:20.250> of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
situations like if you want to kind of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.699 
situations like if you want to kind of
race<00:03:20.549> around<00:03:20.940> or<00:03:21.510> especially<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.590> through

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
race around or especially going through

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.280 
race around or especially going through
dirt<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.459> things<00:03:23.790> like<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.450> helps<00:03:24.599> keep

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
dirt and things like that it helps keep
