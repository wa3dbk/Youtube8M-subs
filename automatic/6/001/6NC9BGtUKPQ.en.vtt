does come and this video is about where
to<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.420> vibrato<00:00:18.980> some<00:00:19.980> time<00:00:20.189> ago<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to start with vibrato some time ago I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.990 
to start with vibrato some time ago I
had<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.449> Skype<00:00:21.990> student<00:00:22.470> who<00:00:22.650> bought<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> my

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
had a Skype student who bought one of my

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
skype lessons and he was busy on his own

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.169 
skype lessons and he was busy on his own
starting<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.439> vibrato<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.340> he<00:00:29.609> didn't<00:00:29.970> get

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
starting with vibrato and he didn't get

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.880 
starting with vibrato and he didn't get
any<00:00:30.449> results<00:00:31.109> why<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.430> he<00:00:32.640> started<00:00:33.239> with

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
any results why because he started with

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.290 
any results why because he started with
with<00:00:34.890> trying<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.940> imitate<00:00:36.270> vibrato<00:00:38.090> like<00:00:39.090> he

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
with trying to imitate vibrato like he

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.860 
with trying to imitate vibrato like he
saw<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.930> videos<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.430> he<00:00:41.610> saw<00:00:41.879> solo<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
saw it in videos or like he saw solo is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
saw it in videos or like he saw solo is
doing<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> start

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
doing it but that's not the way to start

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.080 
doing it but that's not the way to start
with<00:00:45.420> vibrato<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.559> need<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.219> some<00:00:47.670> proper

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
with vibrato you need to do some proper

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.619 
with vibrato you need to do some proper
and<00:00:49.520> preparation<00:00:51.980> exercises<00:00:53.210> because<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and preparation exercises because if you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.500 
and preparation exercises because if you
just<00:00:54.930> start<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.969> moving<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.120> finger

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just start out with moving your finger

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.650 
just start out with moving your finger
around<00:00:58.430> like<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.660> won't<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:03.000> won't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
around like this then you won't it won't

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.109 
around like this then you won't it won't
work<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> most<00:01:04.830> cases<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.460> doesn't<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
work in most cases it doesn't work that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.859 
work in most cases it doesn't work that
you<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.090> start<00:01:09.260> with<00:01:11.270> vibrato<00:01:12.270> as

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you just you know start with vibrato as

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.340 
you just you know start with vibrato as
you<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.740> videos<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> video

I'm going to give you some exercises

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.359 
I'm going to give you some exercises
with<00:01:19.439> which<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.580> some<00:01:20.850> results<00:01:22.369> so

where<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> start<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.509> vibrato<00:01:24.869> I'll<00:01:25.799> give

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
where to start with vibrato I'll give

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.560 
where to start with vibrato I'll give
you<00:01:26.610> five<00:01:27.000> exercises<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.680> dry<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.159> out

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
you five exercises and just dry them out

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
you five exercises and just dry them out
exercise<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.170> called<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> small<00:01:32.040> siren

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
exercise one is called the small siren

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
exercise one is called the small siren
and<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.430> wrists<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.630> will

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and that's from your wrists so you will

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.480 
and that's from your wrists so you will
pick<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> down<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> third<00:01:38.460> finger

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
pick it down with the third finger

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.789 
pick it down with the third finger
usually<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.579> easiest<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:42.810> from

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
usually it's it's easiest and then from

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.970 
usually it's it's easiest and then from
your<00:01:43.829> wrist<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.220 

it's<00:01:49.980> not<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.150> sound<00:01:51.510> good

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
it's not about that it will sound good

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.910 
it's not about that it will sound good
it's<00:01:52.620> just<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.280> exercise<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:54.530> moving<00:01:55.530> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's just an exercise for moving your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.820 
it's just an exercise for moving your
wrist<00:01:56.220> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.180> direction<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.440> string

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
wrist in the direction of the string

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.860 
wrist in the direction of the string
because<00:01:59.190> some<00:01:59.430> people<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.940> start<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.600> few

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
because some people that start with few

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.020 
because some people that start with few
brothers<00:02:01.290> start<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> move<00:02:02.220> like<00:02:02.400> this<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.940> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
brothers start to move like this and it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.640 
brothers start to move like this and it
won't<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.330> any<00:02:03.480> effect<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.290> vibrato

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
won't have any effect because vibrato

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.750 
won't have any effect because vibrato
has<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.580> move<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.950> direction<00:02:07.980> of<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
has to move in the direction of the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.760 
has to move in the direction of the
string<00:02:09.119> otherwise<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.930> won't<00:02:10.110> hear<00:02:10.320> it<00:02:10.380> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
string otherwise you won't hear it it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.710 
string otherwise you won't hear it it
will<00:02:11.310> move<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> different<00:02:11.850> direction<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
will move in a different direction that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.370 
will move in a different direction that
is<00:02:12.840> not<00:02:12.990> variable<00:02:13.410> or<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.670> little<00:02:14.940> bit<00:02:15.380> so

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
is not variable or just a little bit so

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.820 
is not variable or just a little bit so
exercise<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.270> small<00:02:18.750> side<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.590> do

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
exercise one is the small side we do

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.490 
exercise one is the small side we do
that<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.340> every<00:02:21.060> finger<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.350> in

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that with every finger do this in

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
that with every finger do this in
different<00:02:22.530> rhythms<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:24.270> best<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.630> do<00:02:24.810> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
different rhythms it's best to do that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.890 
different rhythms it's best to do that
to<00:02:25.260> practice<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> metronome<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
to practice it with a metronome and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.090 
to practice it with a metronome and
choose<00:02:27.900> different<00:02:28.320> rhythms<00:02:28.820> faster<00:02:29.820> slower

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
choose different rhythms faster slower

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.800 
choose different rhythms faster slower
and<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:33.830> different<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.900> different<00:02:37.140> ways<00:02:38.810> so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
and in different in different ways so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.410 
and in different in different ways so
you<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:40.200> really<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:41.190> control<00:02:41.700> over<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you will really have control over the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.960 
you will really have control over the
speed<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.170> movement<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.010> also<00:02:44.310> offered

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
speed of this movement and also offered

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.530 
speed of this movement and also offered
it<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.470> flexibility<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.000> movement

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it and a flexibility of the movement

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.320 
it and a flexibility of the movement
because<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.560> don't<00:02:49.830> do<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:51.450> way<00:02:52.310> or

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
because you don't do it this way or

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.240 
because you don't do it this way or
something<00:02:54.330> like<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.470> make<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
something like that you really make a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.780 
something like that you really make a
siren<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.290> well<00:02:58.290> exercise<00:02:58.890> number<00:02:59.190> two<00:02:59.580> is

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
siren of it well exercise number two is

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
siren of it well exercise number two is
you<00:03:00.060> take<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.540> cloth<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.290> put<00:03:04.530> your

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
you take a cloth like this you put your

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.130 
you take a cloth like this you put your
bow<00:03:04.920> away<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.400> put<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> cloth<00:03:06.239> over<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.900> file

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
bow away you put the cloth over the file

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.759 
bow away you put the cloth over the file
in<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:08.610> clean<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.870> fingerboard<00:03:10.260> Oh

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
in and you just clean the fingerboard Oh

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.490 
in and you just clean the fingerboard Oh
like<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.850> can<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.420> small<00:03:15.780> like

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
like this and you can do that small like

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.009 
like this and you can do that small like
this<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.120> make<00:03:18.330> also<00:03:18.750> large

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
this and you can make also large

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.530 
this and you can make also large
movements<00:03:19.680> also<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.480> different

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
movements also do this in different

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.140 
movements also do this in different
rhythms<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:23.130> maybe<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.489> bit<00:03:23.640> hard<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.060> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
rhythms it's maybe a bit hard to do it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.430 
rhythms it's maybe a bit hard to do it
with<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> metronome<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.870> don't<00:03:25.260> do<00:03:25.380> this

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
with the metronome so don't do this

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.380 
with the metronome so don't do this
because<00:03:25.590> cloth<00:03:26.040> will<00:03:26.250> fall<00:03:26.489> fall<00:03:27.120> off<00:03:27.239> your

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
because cloth will fall fall off your

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.900 
because cloth will fall fall off your
violin<00:03:27.810> all<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.140> time<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.700> have

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
violin all the time but then you have

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.470 
violin all the time but then you have
this<00:03:30.330> movement<00:03:31.280> exercise<00:03:32.280> number<00:03:32.610> three<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.450> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this movement exercise number three is a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.610 
this movement exercise number three is a
little<00:03:33.750> like<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.670> exercise<00:03:36.150> number<00:03:36.360> one<00:03:36.810> but

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
little like the exercise number one but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.650 
little like the exercise number one but
this<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> big<00:03:38.370> siren<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.120> don't<00:03:39.390> just

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
this is the big siren so you don't just

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.600 
this is the big siren so you don't just
use<00:03:39.959> your<00:03:40.200> wrist<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.100> use<00:03:41.370> also<00:03:41.910> your<00:03:42.209> arm

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
use your wrist but you use also your arm

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.310 
use your wrist but you use also your arm
so<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:44.820> will<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:48.660> they<00:03:48.900> saw<00:03:49.140> your

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
so this will be like like they saw your

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.880 
so this will be like like they saw your
wrist<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.830> your<00:03:50.160> arm<00:03:50.400> your<00:03:50.970> underarm<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
wrist and your arm your underarm and and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.180 
wrist and your arm your underarm and and
then<00:03:53.370> exercise<00:03:53.910> number<00:03:54.840> four<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.800> can<00:03:56.010> do

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
then exercise number four you can do

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.220 
then exercise number four you can do
that<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.670> don't<00:03:56.880> know<00:03:57.000> if<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.359> go<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.570> school<00:03:57.930> or

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
that I don't know if you go to school or

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.900 
that I don't know if you go to school or
to<00:03:58.260> work<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:59.100> it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
to work but it

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.790 
to work but it
if<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.120> are<00:04:00.330> somewhere<00:04:00.990> sitting<00:04:01.320> at<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> table

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
if you are somewhere sitting at a table

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.190 
if you are somewhere sitting at a table
or<00:04:02.160> you're<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.340> having<00:04:02.850> lunch<00:04:03.000> or<00:04:03.420> whatever

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
or you're just having lunch or whatever

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.610 
or you're just having lunch or whatever
let's<00:04:04.710> do<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.490> this<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.120> table<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
let's do like this is the table the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.460 
let's do like this is the table the
other<00:04:07.830> side<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.370> course<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:10.050> pivot

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
other side of course and then just pivot

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.800 
other side of course and then just pivot
your<00:04:10.770> finger<00:04:11.460> like<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:13.790> okay<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.660> is

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
your finger like this okay so that is

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.070 
your finger like this okay so that is
exercise<00:04:16.590> number<00:04:16.620> four<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.700> then<00:04:18.269> exercise

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
exercise number four and then exercise

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.600 
exercise number four and then exercise
number<00:04:19.739> five<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:21.420> from<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.930> from<00:04:22.770> this

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
number five is that from this from this

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.200 
number five is that from this from this
Irene<00:04:24.120> movement<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:29.250> put<00:04:29.490> your<00:04:29.700> finger<00:04:30.030> down

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
Irene movement you put your finger down

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.240 
Irene movement you put your finger down
at<00:04:30.510> one<00:04:30.660> spot<00:04:30.960> your<00:04:31.230> third<00:04:31.470> finger<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:31.890> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
at one spot your third finger is the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.170 
at one spot your third finger is the
easiest<00:04:32.670> one<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:35.490> put<00:04:35.700> your<00:04:35.820> finger<00:04:36.060> down

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
easiest one and you put your finger down

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.960 
easiest one and you put your finger down
but<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:36.540> keep<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.260> same<00:04:37.530> movement<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.430> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
but you keep the same movement so the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.910 
but you keep the same movement so the
vibrato<00:04:39.330> movement<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.080> really<00:04:40.470> from<00:04:40.740> your

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
vibrato movement is really from your

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.890 
vibrato movement is really from your
shoulder<00:04:41.340> through<00:04:41.670> your<00:04:41.940> arm<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:42.420> not<00:04:42.540> just

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
shoulder through your arm it's not just

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.320 
shoulder through your arm it's not just
your<00:04:43.110> finger<00:04:43.500> it's<00:04:43.740> an<00:04:44.280> issue<00:04:44.460> she<00:04:44.700> initiated

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
your finger it's an issue she initiated

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.110 
your finger it's an issue she initiated
here<00:04:45.660> maybe<00:04:45.990> even<00:04:46.140> at<00:04:46.650> your<00:04:46.680> back<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.910> goes

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
here maybe even at your back and it goes

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120 
here maybe even at your back and it goes
all<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.390> way<00:04:48.510> down<00:04:48.630> ends<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.560> your<00:04:49.590> finger<00:04:50.100> and

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
all the way down ends to your finger and

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.190 
all the way down ends to your finger and
the<00:04:50.580> most<00:04:50.910> important<00:04:51.420> thing<00:04:51.540> is<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.020> all

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
the most important thing is that it all

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.100 
the most important thing is that it all
must<00:04:52.590> be<00:04:52.740> rhythmical<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:54.270> must<00:04:54.510> be<00:04:54.690> smooth

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
must be rhythmical and it must be smooth

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.530 
must be rhythmical and it must be smooth
so<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.530> metronome<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.640> really<00:04:56.970> help<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.390> if

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
so a metronome can really help you if

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.720 
so a metronome can really help you if
you<00:04:57.630> put<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.810> finger<00:04:58.080> down<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.310> choose

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
you put a finger down that you choose

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.940 
you put a finger down that you choose
different<00:05:00.210> rhythms<00:05:00.600> slow<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.680> fast<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:03.950> yeah

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
different rhythms slow and fast so yeah

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.800 
different rhythms slow and fast so yeah
you<00:05:05.250> can<00:05:05.460> really<00:05:05.730> get<00:05:06.060> control<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.510> the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
you can really get control of the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.050 
you can really get control of the
movement<00:05:07.230> because<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.650> will<00:05:07.860> not<00:05:08.010> use<00:05:08.370> the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
movement because you will not use the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.320 
movement because you will not use the
same<00:05:09.390> sort<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:10.080> vibrato<00:05:10.530> all<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.160> time<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.730> so

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
same sort of vibrato all the time and so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.390 
same sort of vibrato all the time and so
you<00:05:12.390> need<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.630> be<00:05:12.750> flexible<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.980> color<00:05:14.190> of

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
you need to be flexible in the color of

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.860 
you need to be flexible in the color of
your<00:05:14.640> vibrato<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.530> hope<00:05:16.860> with<00:05:17.130> these<00:05:17.340> five
