00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.140 

try<00:00:20.590> to<00:00:20.650> this<00:00:20.920> engine<00:00:21.310> you<00:00:21.520> know<00:00:21.640> specifically

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
try to this engine you know specifically

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.990 
try to this engine you know specifically
for<00:00:22.360> powerful<00:00:22.510> three<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:24.070> then<00:00:24.610> you<00:00:24.640> know<00:00:24.790> we

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
for powerful three and then you know we

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.609 
for powerful three and then you know we
came<00:00:25.150> to<00:00:25.300> conclusion<00:00:25.480> that<00:00:25.869> other<00:00:26.320> people

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
came to conclusion that other people

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.109 
came to conclusion that other people
actually<00:00:26.890> have<00:00:26.920> used<00:00:27.220> for<00:00:27.400> this<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.790> I<00:00:28.060> think

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
actually have used for this and I think

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.269 
actually have used for this and I think
it's<00:00:28.360> pretty<00:00:28.630> amazing<00:00:28.840> that<00:00:29.110> you<00:00:29.710> guys<00:00:29.740> are

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
it's pretty amazing that you guys are

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.700 
it's pretty amazing that you guys are
making<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.640> racing<00:00:30.939> game<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.240> our<00:00:31.570> engine<00:00:31.960> it<00:00:32.650> is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
making a racing game of our engine it is

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.650 
making a racing game of our engine it is
definitely<00:00:33.220> because<00:00:33.699> you<00:00:34.239> know<00:00:34.330> without<00:00:34.480> the

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
definitely because you know without the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.900 
definitely because you know without the
engine<00:00:35.080> we<00:00:35.350> we<00:00:36.160> wouldn't<00:00:36.430> have<00:00:36.520> been<00:00:36.640> able<00:00:36.730> to

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
engine we we wouldn't have been able to

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.150 
engine we we wouldn't have been able to
deliver<00:00:37.239> our<00:00:37.480> concept<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.170> using<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:38.920> key

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
deliver our concept and using the key

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.729 
deliver our concept and using the key
technologies<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:39.970> be<00:00:40.000> able<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.300> provide<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
technologies to be able to provide the

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.830 
technologies to be able to provide the
south<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.220> 3<00:00:45.430> is<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.879> true<00:00:46.239> successional

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
south of 3 is the true successional

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.720 
south of 3 is the true successional
bathroom<00:00:47.199> too<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:47.860> need<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.190> make<00:00:48.460> everything

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
bathroom too we need to make everything

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.819 
bathroom too we need to make everything
bigger<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.450> better<00:00:49.600> basically<00:00:50.260> we<00:00:50.500> need<00:00:50.680> to

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
bigger and better basically we need to

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.190 
bigger and better basically we need to
develop<00:00:51.100> new<00:00:51.370> technology<00:00:52.030> for<00:00:52.570> doing<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.960> so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
develop new technology for doing that so

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.990 
develop new technology for doing that so
one<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.410> those<00:00:53.530> think<00:00:53.800> is<00:00:53.920> screaming<00:00:54.460> the

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
one of those think is screaming the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.119 
one of those think is screaming the
contents<00:00:55.510> into<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.809> maps<00:00:56.079> with<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:56.800> we<00:00:56.980> can

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
contents into the maps with that we can

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.799 
contents into the maps with that we can
build<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.579> biggest<00:00:57.730> at<00:00:58.000> work<00:00:58.180> we<00:00:58.390> have<00:00:58.510> done

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
build the biggest at work we have done

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.840 
build the biggest at work we have done
before<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.590> I<00:01:00.250> think<00:01:00.430> that<00:01:00.550> that's<00:01:00.579> something

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
before and I think that that's something

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.760 
before and I think that that's something
that<00:01:01.090> you<00:01:01.270> also<00:01:01.450> benefit<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.230> lot<00:01:02.289> from<00:01:02.410> right

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
that you also benefit a lot from right

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.979 
that you also benefit a lot from right
definitely<00:01:03.460> we<00:01:03.640> need<00:01:03.670> for<00:01:03.940> speed<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.690> concept

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
definitely we need for speed the concept

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.300 
definitely we need for speed the concept
that<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.229> went<00:01:05.379> with<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.680> coast<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:05.979> costa

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
that we went with the coast of costa

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.070 
that we went with the coast of costa
race<00:01:06.460> really<00:01:07.119> couldn't<00:01:07.479> been<00:01:07.570> built<00:01:07.810> without

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
race really couldn't been built without

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.960 
race really couldn't been built without
scale<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.770> order<00:01:09.039> to<00:01:09.130> pull<00:01:09.310> off<00:01:09.490> what<00:01:09.729> we<00:01:09.820> need

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
scale in order to pull off what we need

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.520 
scale in order to pull off what we need
to<00:01:10.119> do<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.479> basically<00:01:10.750> doubled<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.259> length<00:01:11.380> of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
to do we basically doubled the length of

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.710 
to do we basically doubled the length of
our<00:01:11.649> tracks<00:01:11.950> we<00:01:12.399> quadrupled<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:13.420> number<00:01:13.450> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
our tracks we quadrupled the number of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.300 
our tracks we quadrupled the number of
textures<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.440> know<00:01:14.560> four<00:01:14.890> times<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.220> number

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
textures you know four times the number

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.700 
textures you know four times the number
of<00:01:15.430> objects<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.660> scale<00:01:16.960> for<00:01:17.170> us<00:01:17.320> just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
of objects so the scale for us just

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.039 
of objects so the scale for us just
wasn't<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.070> team<00:01:18.250> go<00:01:18.399> on<00:01:18.430> an<00:01:18.670> old<00:01:18.789> engine<00:01:18.970> it's<00:01:19.930> a

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
wasn't a team go on an old engine it's a

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.480 
wasn't a team go on an old engine it's a
terrain<00:01:20.320> system<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.920> guys<00:01:21.070> developed

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
terrain system that you guys developed

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.039 
terrain system that you guys developed
obviously<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.000> allows<00:01:22.180> us<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.630> basically<00:01:22.750> have

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
obviously it allows us to basically have

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.870 
obviously it allows us to basically have
our<00:01:23.200> vistas<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.619> we<00:01:23.860> have<00:01:24.040> you<00:01:24.580> know<00:01:24.700> when

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
our vistas that we have you know when

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.219 
our vistas that we have you know when
you<00:01:24.970> drive<00:01:25.180> down<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.510> highways<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.930> can<00:01:26.080> see

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
you drive down the highways you can see

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.899 
you drive down the highways you can see
for<00:01:26.439> miles<00:01:26.619> out<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.070> desert<00:01:27.250> secret

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
for miles out in the desert secret

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.700 
for miles out in the desert secret
models<00:01:28.180> out<00:01:28.330> there<00:01:28.360> mountains<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.560> really

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
models out there mountains and it really

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.249 
models out there mountains and it really
sells<00:01:30.010> that<00:01:30.250> sense<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.549> journey<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
sells that sense of journey the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.530 
sells that sense of journey the
destruction<00:01:35.830> enables<00:01:36.340> us<00:01:36.490> now<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.939> do<00:01:37.240> things

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
destruction enables us now to do things

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.719 
destruction enables us now to do things
that<00:01:37.659> no<00:01:37.900> one<00:01:38.350> else<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.830> able<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.280> do<00:01:39.400> really

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
that no one else is able to do really

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.850 
that no one else is able to do really
like<00:01:39.909> know<00:01:40.270> just<00:01:40.299> seeing<00:01:40.780> other<00:01:41.049> players<00:01:41.470> from

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
like know just seeing other players from

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.560 
like know just seeing other players from
other<00:01:42.040> playing<00:01:42.369> other<00:01:42.549> shooters<00:01:43.000> coming<00:01:43.299> into

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
other playing other shooters coming into

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.480 
other playing other shooters coming into
belfield<00:01:44.049> where<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.890> know<00:01:44.979> why<00:01:45.100> not<00:01:45.280> play

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
belfield where you know why not play

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.160 
belfield where you know why not play
about<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:46.000> now<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:46.420> natural<00:01:46.630> for<00:01:46.930> me<00:01:47.140> to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
about that now it's natural for me to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.649 
about that now it's natural for me to
just<00:01:47.409> go<00:01:47.590> through<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:48.159> wall<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:48.939> if<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.210> driving

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
just go through the wall so if I driving

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.539 
just go through the wall so if I driving
a<00:01:49.720> tank<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.380> if<00:01:50.530> someone<00:01:50.680> hiding<00:01:51.009> behind<00:01:51.280> the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
a tank and if someone hiding behind the

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.069 
a tank and if someone hiding behind the
wall<00:01:51.700> there's<00:01:51.970> life<00:01:52.240> for<00:01:52.450> somewhere<00:01:52.720> far<00:01:53.049> away

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
wall there's life for somewhere far away

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.260 
wall there's life for somewhere far away
I<00:01:53.530> just<00:01:54.070> take<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.430> whole<00:01:54.670> building<00:01:54.909> where

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
I just take out the whole building where

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.429 
I just take out the whole building where

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
I know the wall that he's hiding behind

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.010 
I know the wall that he's hiding behind
while<00:01:57.340> like<00:01:57.549> they<00:01:57.670> say<00:01:57.820> people<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.180> not<00:01:58.780> used

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
while like they say people that not used

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.940 
to playing the bass and they are trying
to<00:02:00.939> run<00:02:01.119> around<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.479> walls<00:02:01.689> all<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> time<00:02:02.350> and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to run around the walls all the time and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.830 
to run around the walls all the time and
I'm<00:02:03.100> just<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:03.399> laughing<00:02:04.090> at<00:02:04.360> them<00:02:04.540> with<00:02:04.659> what

so<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.800> us<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.100> was<00:02:26.130> all<00:02:26.340> about<00:02:26.520> harnessing

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
so for us it was all about harnessing

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.670 
so for us it was all about harnessing
that<00:02:27.000> power<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.450> create<00:02:27.660> objects<00:02:28.110> nice<00:02:28.260> master

along<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> drive<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.600> really<00:02:36.810> has<00:02:37.020> allowed<00:02:37.410> us

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
along the drive it really has allowed us

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
to set the bar a little bit higher as a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.420 
to set the bar a little bit higher as a
racing<00:02:39.630> game<00:02:39.660> across<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> board

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.729 

we<00:02:44.359> rewrote<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.750> whole<00:02:44.900> rendering<00:02:45.409> engine

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
we rewrote the whole rendering engine

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.250 
we rewrote the whole rendering engine
from<00:02:45.920> scratch<00:02:46.219> and<00:02:46.879> that<00:02:47.000> enables<00:02:47.450> us<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.659> have

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
from scratch and that enables us to have

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.349 
from scratch and that enables us to have
more<00:02:48.709> light<00:02:49.250> sources<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.879> make<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.150> more

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
more light sources to make it more

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.780 
more light sources to make it more
cinematic<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:51.349> do<00:02:51.920> both<00:02:52.099> indoor<00:02:52.609> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
cinematic we can do both indoor and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.759 
cinematic we can do both indoor and
outdoor<00:02:52.849> lighting<00:02:53.719> so<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.049> see<00:02:54.349> actually

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
outdoor lighting so you see actually

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.009 
outdoor lighting so you see actually
real<00:02:55.340> shadows<00:02:55.819> going<00:02:56.150> around<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> game<00:02:56.719> and

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
real shadows going around the game and

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.199 
real shadows going around the game and
just<00:02:57.409> with<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.159> destruction<00:02:58.519> we<00:02:58.849> have<00:02:59.030> all

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
just with the destruction we have all

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.209 
just with the destruction we have all
these<00:02:59.329> explosions<00:02:59.810> in<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.319> smoke<00:03:00.680> coming<00:03:00.950> out

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
these explosions in the smoke coming out

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.789 
these explosions in the smoke coming out
when<00:03:02.060> he<00:03:02.209> needed<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:02.840> particle<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.469> they<00:03:03.560> affect

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
when he needed a particle so they affect

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.500 
when he needed a particle so they affect
to<00:03:03.889> look<00:03:04.010> really<00:03:04.430> good<00:03:04.579> as<00:03:04.790> well<00:03:04.969> like<00:03:05.269> really

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
to look really good as well like really

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.420 
to look really good as well like really
cinematic<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.620> obviously<00:03:06.980> for<00:03:07.069> us<00:03:07.250> by

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
rendering was very key for us in the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.780 
rendering was very key for us in the

down<00:03:25.069> some<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> smaller<00:03:25.849> pieces<00:03:26.419> and<00:03:26.599> I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
down some of the smaller pieces and I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.179 
down some of the smaller pieces and I
think<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.139> players<00:03:27.319> will<00:03:27.530> pick<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:27.829> on<00:03:27.980> which

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
think the players will pick up on which

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.129 
think the players will pick up on which
is<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.849> know<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.150> tire<00:03:29.329> spray<00:03:29.689> going<00:03:29.900> through

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
is you know the tire spray going through

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.349 
is you know the tire spray going through
a<00:03:30.230> thunderstorm<00:03:30.650> in<00:03:31.219> the<00:03:31.430> plains<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.090> picking

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
a thunderstorm in the plains and picking

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
up a lighting up that Chicago there's

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.300 
up a lighting up that Chicago there's

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
you know blasting pillars Dustin and

obviously sound everything has to be

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.070 
obviously sound everything has to be
done<00:04:06.250> dynamically<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.629> that's<00:04:07.900> what<00:04:08.050> our

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
done dynamically and that's what our

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.619 
done dynamically and that's what our
engine<00:04:08.560> actually<00:04:08.860> does<00:04:09.069> with<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.489> audio<00:04:09.790> so

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
engine actually does with the audio so

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.780 
engine actually does with the audio so
you<00:04:10.660> can<00:04:10.959> actually<00:04:11.110> distinguish<00:04:11.860> what<00:04:12.430> gonna

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
you can actually distinguish what gonna

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
the sound comes from what this does what

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.979 
the sound comes from what this does what

the bigger beats of the the journey you

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.310 
the bigger beats of the the journey you
know<00:04:21.910> whether<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.210> be<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.330> thunderstorm<00:04:22.960> or<00:04:23.199> an

Rock pebble sounds as you drive over a

Rock pebble sounds as you drive over a
shortcut<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.240> wine<00:04:28.419> of<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.660> engine<00:04:29.050> is

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.950 

what<00:04:33.849> it's<00:04:33.970> allowed<00:04:34.210> us<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.389> do<00:04:34.599> is<00:04:34.720> basically

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
what it's allowed us to do is basically

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.050 
what it's allowed us to do is basically
build<00:04:35.379> more<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.800> more<00:04:35.949> layers<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.580> sounded

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
build more and more layers of sounded

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.490 
build more and more layers of sounded
the<00:04:37.360> inputs<00:04:37.810> are<00:04:37.930> coming<00:04:38.199> from<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:38.349> right

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the inputs are coming from the right

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.350 
the inputs are coming from the right
places<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.099> then<00:04:39.220> as<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.460> pass<00:04:39.669> by<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.940> given

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
places and then as you pass by a given

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.510 
places and then as you pass by a given
sound<00:04:40.660> or<00:04:40.870> explosion<00:04:41.409> or<00:04:41.830> hear<00:04:42.099> something<00:04:42.129> in

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
sound or explosion or hear something in

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.920 
sound or explosion or hear something in
the<00:04:42.550> distance<00:04:42.729> that<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.270> feels<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.629> right<00:04:43.780> it

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
the distance that it feels the right it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.659 
the distance that it feels the right it
feels<00:04:43.960> balanced<00:04:44.560> ting<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:44.979> you<00:04:45.370> get<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
feels balanced ting and you get the

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.950 
feels balanced ting and you get the
perception<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.509> everything<00:04:46.870> is

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
perception and that everything is

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:56.589 
perception and that everything is
working<00:04:47.289> as<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.949> package

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.450 

so<00:04:57.599> we<00:04:57.720> look<00:04:57.870> back<00:04:58.349> at<00:04:58.680> this<00:04:58.889> porch<00:04:59.220> game

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
so we look back at this porch game

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.969 
so we look back at this porch game
actually<00:04:59.669> looking<00:05:00.419> at<00:05:00.479> FIFA<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.229> Madden<00:05:01.770> and

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
actually looking at FIFA and Madden and

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.830 
actually looking at FIFA and Madden and
what<00:05:02.520> they've<00:05:02.699> done<00:05:02.909> method<00:05:03.210> players<00:05:03.449> when

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
what they've done method players when

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.149 
what they've done method players when
they're<00:05:03.990> running<00:05:04.080> around<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:04.740> keeping<00:05:04.979> the

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
they're running around and keeping the

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.939 
they're running around and keeping the
ball<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.520> looks<00:05:05.759> so<00:05:06.060> realistic<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.949> imagine

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
ball it looks so realistic and imagine

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.070 
ball it looks so realistic and imagine
that<00:05:08.069> we<00:05:08.159> took<00:05:08.610> that<00:05:08.849> innovation<00:05:09.419> system<00:05:09.750> and

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
that we took that innovation system and

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.050 
that we took that innovation system and
brought<00:05:10.319> that<00:05:10.500> into<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.889> shooter<00:05:11.190> game<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:11.819> when

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
brought that into a shooter game so when

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.760 
brought that into a shooter game so when
the<00:05:12.180> soldiers<00:05:12.629> are<00:05:12.720> running<00:05:13.020> around<00:05:13.110> gunning

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
the soldiers are running around gunning

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.010 
the soldiers are running around gunning
each<00:05:13.860> other<00:05:14.069> it<00:05:14.699> looks<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.060> fluid<00:05:15.479> so

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
each other it looks so fluid so

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.749 
each other it looks so fluid so
realistic<00:05:16.349> and<00:05:16.680> then<00:05:16.889> for<00:05:17.099> us<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.490> know<00:05:17.520> we

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
realistic and then for us you know we

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.390 
realistic and then for us you know we
start<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.270> game<00:05:18.449> at<00:05:18.629> a<00:05:18.780> very<00:05:18.960> tense<00:05:19.400> cinematic

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
start the game at a very tense cinematic

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.580 
start the game at a very tense cinematic
moment<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:20.940> frostbite<00:05:21.629> basically<00:05:22.110> has

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
moment and frostbite basically has

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.499 
moment and frostbite basically has
allowed<00:05:22.889> us<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.159> create<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.879> very<00:05:24.120> human

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
allowed us to create that very human

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.029 
allowed us to create that very human
aspect<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.050> was<00:05:25.199> one<00:05:25.349> of<00:05:25.380> our<00:05:25.530> key<00:05:25.710> tenants

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
aspect this was one of our key tenants

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.200 
aspect this was one of our key tenants
for<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.280> game<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.669> really<00:05:26.909> bring<00:05:27.180> the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
for the game and really bring the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.689 
for the game and really bring the
emotion<00:05:27.630> out<00:05:27.720> in<00:05:27.870> Jack<00:05:28.110> as<00:05:28.349> he<00:05:28.979> opens<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.520> game

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
emotion out in Jack as he opens the game

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.029 
emotion out in Jack as he opens the game
up<00:05:29.909> and<00:05:30.150> beyond<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:31.199> mean<00:05:31.440> as<00:05:31.590> we've

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
up and beyond that I mean as we've

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.320 
up and beyond that I mean as we've
described<00:05:32.400> some<00:05:32.639> of<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.759> moments<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.180> go

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
described some of the moments you go

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.120 
described some of the moments you go
through<00:05:33.599> over<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.050> course<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.500> lot<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:35.039> them

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
through over the course a lot of them

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.920 
through over the course a lot of them
are<00:05:35.310> very<00:05:35.430> animated<00:05:35.610> moments<00:05:36.389> and<00:05:36.630> so<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
are very animated moments and so the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.510 
are very animated moments and so the
animation<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.620> didn't<00:05:37.889> cross<00:05:38.069> wires<00:05:38.310> that

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
animation and didn't cross wires that

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.339 
animation and didn't cross wires that
allowed<00:05:38.819> us<00:05:38.849> to<00:05:39.030> pull<00:05:39.419> off<00:05:39.569> some<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.900> these

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
allowed us to pull off some of these

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.379 
allowed us to pull off some of these
moments<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:41.039> these<00:05:41.130> these<00:05:41.550> epic<00:05:41.909> beats<00:05:42.150> in

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
moments and these these epic beats in

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.969 
moments and these these epic beats in
the<00:05:42.509> part<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:42.960> journey<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.259> we<00:05:43.800> wouldn't

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
the part of the journey that we wouldn't

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.070 
the part of the journey that we wouldn't
have<00:05:44.130> been<00:05:44.219> otherwise<00:05:44.610> able<00:05:44.940> to<00:05:45.060> walk

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
have been otherwise able to walk

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.119 
have been otherwise able to walk
I<00:05:48.990> think<00:05:49.990> it's<00:05:50.080> great<00:05:50.229> that<00:05:50.319> we've<00:05:50.590> made<00:05:50.949> this

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
I think it's great that we've made this

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.279 
I think it's great that we've made this
engine<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:51.699> then<00:05:51.849> be<00:05:52.090> able<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.300> share<00:05:52.689> it<00:05:52.870> with

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
engine and then be able to share it with

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.529 
engine and then be able to share it with
other<00:05:53.439> teams<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:53.979> just<00:05:54.159> like<00:05:54.400> focus<00:05:55.389> and

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
other teams and just like focus and

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.089 
other teams and just like focus and
actually<00:05:55.810> making<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.139> game<00:05:56.409> and<00:05:56.650> not<00:05:56.949> the

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
actually making the game and not the

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.860 
actually making the game and not the
technology<00:05:57.430> just<00:05:58.090> that<00:05:58.210> we<00:05:58.449> actually<00:05:58.599> got

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
technology just that we actually got

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.290 
technology just that we actually got
stuff<00:05:59.439> back<00:05:59.680> from<00:05:59.710> you<00:06:00.039> guys<00:06:00.219> we<00:06:00.729> have<00:06:01.000> roads

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
stuff back from you guys we have roads

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.899 
stuff back from you guys we have roads
and<00:06:01.629> they<00:06:01.900> built<00:06:02.139> a<00:06:02.349> tool<00:06:02.740> for<00:06:02.800> building<00:06:03.490> roads

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
and they built a tool for building roads

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.700 
and they built a tool for building roads
or<00:06:04.449> actually<00:06:04.719> could<00:06:04.900> bring<00:06:05.139> that<00:06:05.319> tool<00:06:05.530> back

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
or actually could bring that tool back

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.409 
or actually could bring that tool back
to<00:06:05.860> balance<00:06:06.310> where<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.550> can<00:06:06.699> build<00:06:06.879> roads

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
to balance where you can build roads

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.420 
to balance where you can build roads
faster<00:06:08.020> for<00:06:08.259> example<00:06:08.710> that<00:06:08.889> I<00:06:09.039> think<00:06:09.280> that's

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
faster for example that I think that's

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.670 
faster for example that I think that's
not<00:06:09.639> very<00:06:09.819> cool<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.389> then<00:06:10.810> for<00:06:11.020> us<00:06:11.139> we<00:06:11.530> knew

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
not very cool and then for us we knew

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.230 
not very cool and then for us we knew
the<00:06:11.860> game<00:06:12.009> we<00:06:12.159> wanted<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.520> make<00:06:12.669> we<00:06:12.909> looked<00:06:13.120> at

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
the game we wanted to make we looked at

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.119 
the game we wanted to make we looked at
number<00:06:13.449> of<00:06:13.539> different<00:06:13.810> options<00:06:14.139> and<00:06:14.349> frost

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
number of different options and frost

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.950 
number of different options and frost
went<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.520> was<00:06:15.759> the<00:06:15.909> one<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.270> allowed<00:06:16.539> us<00:06:16.569> to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
went to was the one that allowed us to

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.809 
went to was the one that allowed us to
develop<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.530> concept<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:18.310> build<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.639> game

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
develop the concept and build the game

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.730 
develop the concept and build the game
that<00:06:19.060> we<00:06:19.180> want<00:06:19.389> to<00:06:19.539> do<00:06:19.659> you<00:06:20.050> know<00:06:20.169> what<00:06:20.620> we've

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
that we want to do you know what we've

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.990 
that we want to do you know what we've
delivered<00:06:20.979> this<00:06:21.190> year<00:06:21.250> we're<00:06:21.550> very<00:06:21.729> proud<00:06:21.940> of

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
delivered this year we're very proud of

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.240 
delivered this year we're very proud of
what<00:06:22.930> we<00:06:23.080> see<00:06:23.289> even<00:06:23.560> greater<00:06:23.590> things<00:06:24.039> in<00:06:24.159> the

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
what we see even greater things in the

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.189 
what we see even greater things in the
future<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.729> know<00:06:24.879> that<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.539> run<00:06:25.719> is<00:06:25.900> just<00:06:26.050> the

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
future you know that the run is just the

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.450 
future you know that the run is just the
start<00:06:26.259> of<00:06:26.560> what<00:06:26.710> we<00:06:26.800> think<00:06:26.979> we<00:06:27.099> can<00:06:27.219> do<00:06:27.340> is

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
start of what we think we can do is

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:51.540 
start of what we think we can do is
cross<00:06:27.669> bike

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.610 

you
