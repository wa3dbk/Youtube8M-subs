00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 the goal pieters what demands to go with the world in the rear than the 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.340
 inspector strootman and van bommel rock hard sneijder and vanie behind the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.920
 deep striker klaas jan huntelaar who is in good shape at schalke 0 4 and likes a lot 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.520
 wants to score but that goes for more players towards the end the beat is awake 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.159
 san marino and al 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.070
 six minutes 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.119
 it is the first time that Robin van Persie hits the mark 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.159
 as specified by mark van bommel 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.579
 It happened to chronicle an announced monster score 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.380
 And that is certainly the opening phase of the Netherlands 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.120
 give head for that matter 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.120
 Wesley Sneijder a beautiful swipe 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.700
 chock full after just over fifteen minutes 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.740
 3 0 at the cross of animal protein and the header of living johnny 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.970
 heitinga 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.950
 san marino 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.850
 becomes vermeer saves 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.260
 team barely touches the ball, it is of course not for nothing that it is the number 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.610
 two out of three in the world ranking 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.210
 traveled more do numbers 0 for a 33 against to Eindhoven but arguing 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.330
 close to a goal 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.120
 from numerous supplier andy silva 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.570
 not even that far apart 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.980
 still in the first half the chances of robin van persie 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.790
 Assisted by Wesley Sneijder 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.010
 but this time 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.590
 in the second half, the netherlands remains hungry 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.580
 van persie robben huntelaar and there is cold 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.060
 and that is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 beautifully played out 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 and then there is no more keeping to the word san marino 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.170
 pace as if staged by netherlands welten like double 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.190
 want to win numbers that meant 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.360
 with that, twice scored a 9 0 win over Finland and Norway 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.840
 but never with 10 0 or more huntelaar 5 0 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 escapes from and is that of persie 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.110
 favorable figures 6 0 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.829
 he doesn't put a brake on it two minutes later 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.019
 animal attack of the netherlands with sneijder at primary school t 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.030
 huntelaar one more time they have an option 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.239
 Van Persie 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.019
 the 7 0 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.729
 now the san marino goal figures are the qualifying pool 0 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 for 40 against and that in 0 40 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.349
 it doesn't stop there 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.450
 8 0 on the road 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.869
 for huntelaar 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:38.449
 the double digits are forthcoming that feel said that the players are also feeling on 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.159
 the field 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.159
 Grab your straw man 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.659
 van persie with 9 0 are fourth of the evening and then there are more than ten 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.629
 minutes to play 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.029
 also took the team to come but who will make it 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.029
 the honor first to wesley sneijder who 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.950
 3 0 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.759
 so it is a special evening and also a historical evening 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.659
 because mezzo can do big figures mon netherlands never a Moroccan 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.659
 debutant still participate in the joy at the aldi 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.359
 of course it is 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.359
 certain end on the way 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.929
 you hear it right 11 0 brussels one of the other results in the group of 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.760
 the netherlands was also favorable for orange unscathed from sweden 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.930
 the training the film moldova must here fall with the Netherlands by six points 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.829
 ahead of the number two in sweden 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.509
 the world cup in poland and ukraine is now very close to the group winners places 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.920
 of course anyway and the Netherlands was allowed to fall to second place then 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.729
 the chance is huge that orange is the best number two and is not allowed either 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.619
 two other games to the World Cup 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:43.799
 play off match
