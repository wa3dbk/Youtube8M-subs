earlier<00:00:01.380> in<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.589> week<00:00:01.620> my<00:00:02.190> female<00:00:02.700> clownfish

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
earlier in the week my female clownfish

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.289 
earlier in the week my female clownfish
jumped<00:00:03.780> out<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.200> tank<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.400> best<00:00:05.640> theory

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
jumped out of the tank the best theory

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.430 
jumped out of the tank the best theory
as<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.319> why<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.780> she<00:00:09.780> had<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> clutch<00:00:10.410> of

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
as to why is that she had a clutch of

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.789 
as to why is that she had a clutch of
eggs<00:00:11.210> that<00:00:12.210> were<00:00:12.389> adhering<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.019> rock<00:00:13.440> over

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
eggs that were adhering to a rock over

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.000 
eggs that were adhering to a rock over
there<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> side<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:15.690> male<00:00:16.010> clownfish

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
there at the side the male clownfish

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
there at the side the male clownfish
guards<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> eggs<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.109> it's<00:00:19.109> possible<00:00:19.529> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
guards the eggs and it's possible that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.240 
guards the eggs and it's possible that
during<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> night<00:00:21.199> she<00:00:22.199> wanted<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> cozy<00:00:23.220> up

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
during the night she wanted to cozy up

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.480 
during the night she wanted to cozy up
with<00:00:23.490> him<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.990> he<00:00:24.990> didn't<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.800> didn't

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
with him and he didn't like it I didn't

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.150 
with him and he didn't like it I didn't
realize<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.060> her<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.390> whatever<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
realize it was her or whatever and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.759 
realize it was her or whatever and
chased<00:00:29.160> her<00:00:29.340> bitter<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.630> she<00:00:30.660> ended<00:00:31.650> up

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
chased her bitter and she ended up

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.139 
chased her bitter and she ended up
coming<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> tank<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.000> one

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
coming out of the tank that's just one

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.530 
coming out of the tank that's just one
theory<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.630> wasn't<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.950> wake<00:00:35.070> Court<00:00:35.540> came

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
theory I wasn't was it a wake Court came

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
theory I wasn't was it a wake Court came
up<00:00:36.719> woke<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> morning<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.489> go<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> work

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
up woke up in the morning to go to work

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
up woke up in the morning to go to work
I<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> work<00:00:39.690> early<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.110> she<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I go to work early and she was on the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
I go to work early and she was on the
floor<00:00:41.219> already<00:00:42.120> dead<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.540> clearly<00:00:42.780> been

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
floor already dead had clearly been

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.060 
floor already dead had clearly been
there<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.670> several<00:00:44.670> hours<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:46.890> sad

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
there for several hours so it's very sad

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.029 
there for several hours so it's very sad
because<00:00:47.930> she<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.050> an<00:00:49.140> older<00:00:49.379> clownfish<00:00:49.770> clown

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because she was an older clownfish clown

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.810 
because she was an older clownfish clown
fish<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.370> live<00:00:50.460> around<00:00:50.700> 14<00:00:51.090> years<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.550> she<00:00:53.610> had

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
fish can live around 14 years so she had

fish can live around 14 years so she had
been<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> tank<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> good<00:00:54.809> long<00:00:54.960> time<00:00:55.940> so

been in the tank for a good long time so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
been in the tank for a good long time so
what<00:00:57.059> I've<00:00:57.149> done<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.480> I've<00:00:57.690> purchased<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.410> black

it's<00:01:07.950> important<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> introduce<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.880> new

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it's important when you introduce a new

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
it's important when you introduce a new
clownfish<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> gets<00:01:10.439> along<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.010> they

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
clownfish that it gets along so they

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.440 
clownfish that it gets along so they
need<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> same<00:01:11.970> species<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:14.450> it's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
need to be of the same species and it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.670 
need to be of the same species and it's
a<00:01:15.509> very<00:01:15.750> good<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> juvenile

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
a very good to have it be a juvenile

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.109 
a very good to have it be a juvenile
clownfish<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.250> interesting<00:01:20.490> fish<00:01:20.939> in

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
clownfish are an interesting fish in

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.580 
clownfish are an interesting fish in
that<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.390> change<00:01:21.750> sexes

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that they change sexes

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.219 
that they change sexes
so<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> male<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.840> larger<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so the male which is the the larger of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.130 
so the male which is the the larger of
the<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.360> will<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.780> become

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the two you see now will actually become

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.390 
the two you see now will actually become
a<00:01:28.170> female<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.150> grow<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.450> larger<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.400> then

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
a female and grow much larger and then

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.999 
a female and grow much larger and then
the<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.570> will<00:01:34.259> become<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.799> male

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the the little one will become the male

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.100 
the the little one will become the male
if<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.420> large<00:01:37.229> group<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.770> clownfish

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
if you have a large group of clownfish

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
if you have a large group of clownfish
then<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.950> female<00:01:41.159> one<00:01:41.759> male

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
then you will have one female one male

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.039 
then you will have one female one male
and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:43.110> rest<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> group<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.979> remain

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
and the rest of the group will remain

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
and the rest of the group will remain
immature<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
immature and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.170 
immature and
and<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.570> juvenile<00:01:49.960> stage<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.820> it's<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:51.970> very

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and in a juvenile stage so it's a very

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
and in a juvenile stage so it's a very
very<00:01:52.690> interesting<00:01:54.390> way<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.570> they<00:01:55.690> do<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.990> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
very interesting way that they do it so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.770 
very interesting way that they do it so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
little black one in is it it would take
