that's<00:01:32.570> not<00:01:32.720> plugged<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.100> I'll<00:01:34.220> just

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
that's not plugged in so I'll just

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.070 
that's not plugged in so I'll just
basically<00:01:34.820> switch<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.210> on<00:01:35.330> that's<00:01:35.750> all<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:36.020> can

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
basically switch it on that's all I can

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.420 
basically switch it on that's all I can
do<00:01:36.290> really<00:01:36.440> show<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.550> powers<00:01:37.760> up<00:01:39.430> you

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.660 
do really show that it powers up you
know<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:40.970> what<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.630> obviously<00:01:42.670> unfortunately

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
know so what I obviously unfortunately

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.070 
know so what I obviously unfortunately
have<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.820> do<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.240> because<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.600> last<00:01:44.840> time<00:01:45.050> I

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
have to do is because the last time I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.020 
have to do is because the last time I
use<00:01:45.230> it<00:01:45.350> was<00:01:45.440> donkey's<00:01:45.770> years<00:01:45.800> ago<00:01:46.190> it's<00:01:46.910> gonna

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
use it was donkey's years ago it's gonna

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.560 
use it was donkey's years ago it's gonna
go<00:01:47.210> up<00:01:47.240> as<00:01:47.510> solder<00:01:47.870> scene<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.580> you're<00:01:50.330> not

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
go up as solder scene so you're not

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.470 
go up as solder scene so you're not
getting<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.840> bargain<00:01:51.520> because<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.760> know<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
getting a bargain because I know it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.510 
getting a bargain because I know it
works<00:01:53.690> but<00:01:54.230> I<00:01:54.410> haven't<00:01:54.680> tested<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.220> can't

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
works but I haven't tested it so I can't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.150 
works but I haven't tested it so I can't
tell<00:01:55.730> you<00:01:55.990> right<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.050> that<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.710> works<00:01:57.920> what

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
tell you right now that it works what

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.710 
tell you right now that it works what
doesn't<00:01:58.310> work<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:58.820> I'm<00:01:58.940> got<00:01:59.090> any<00:01:59.240> microphones

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
doesn't work so I'm got any microphones

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.330 
doesn't work so I'm got any microphones
to<00:01:59.840> test<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.230> with<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:00.950> can<00:02:01.100> see<00:02:01.250> it

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
to test it with but you can see it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.490 
to test it with but you can see it
powers<00:02:01.670> up<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.150> switches<00:02:03.050> on<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.229> it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
powers up and switches on and it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.620 
powers up and switches on and it
switches<00:02:03.710> off<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.280> that's<00:02:04.880> basically<00:02:05.270> where

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
switches off and that's basically where

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.020 
switches off and that's basically where
you<00:02:05.840> care<00:02:06.020> about<00:02:06.170> right<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:06.940> it's<00:02:07.940> an

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
you care about right now so it's an

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
you care about right now so it's an
