00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.019
 shortbread with tip 30 and chocolate 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:22.940
 to do it you need 150 g of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:25.039
 butter 100 g cornflour 1 9 75 g of 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.730
 icing sugar 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:33.390
 it made me scene under 150g 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.519
 flour and 5 grams of chocolate to melt 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:43.579
 to know that I have everything divided by 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:43.579
 two two salad bowls we will put 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:52.229
 the butter we are not going to time 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.620
 that he will become creamy like you 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.729
 see 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 no no if you tried it mounir 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:03.889
 it quickly becomes this dough 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.889
 this texture of treme that butter 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.850
 so we put the player like that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.920
 we take the icing sugar and we will put 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.890
 in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:29.690
 the sugar family is where everything goes 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.690
 dom or back 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:50.540

 bowl if you are not too sure of yourself 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.560
 because otherwise we go fishing for 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.890
 shells so we go back to make 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.890
