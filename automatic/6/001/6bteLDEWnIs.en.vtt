directions<00:00:41.190> at<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.329> would<00:00:42.870> keep<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.260> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
directions at all I would keep it in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
directions at all I would keep it in
longer<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.399> wanted<00:00:44.730> bone<00:00:44.969> straight

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
longer because I wanted bone straight

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
longer because I wanted bone straight
hair<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:47.129> overlap<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.090> didn't<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
hair I would overlap I didn't use the a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.920 
hair I would overlap I didn't use the a
base<00:00:51.239> before<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.820> scratch<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.480> day<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
base before I would scratch the day of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
base before I would scratch the day of
and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.160> scratch<00:00:56.699> wilder<00:00:57.270> rocks

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

and tell you that or your stylist may
not<00:04:31.370> tell<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:32.000> not<00:04:32.360> everybody<00:04:33.130> has<00:04:34.130> the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
not tell you that not everybody has the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.250 
not tell you that not everybody has the
hair<00:04:35.270> texture<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.350> relax<00:04:36.889> and<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.430> don't<00:04:37.669> think

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
hair texture to relax and I don't think

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.129 
hair texture to relax and I don't think
my<00:04:39.260> hair<00:04:40.220> texture

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.029 

is<00:04:44.499> one<00:04:45.069> that<00:04:45.370> needed<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.729> be<00:04:45.849> relaxed<00:04:46.599> calm<00:04:47.039> my

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
is one that needed to be relaxed calm my

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.010 
is one that needed to be relaxed calm my
hair<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.400> very<00:04:48.460> fine<00:04:48.939> or<00:04:49.419> maybe<00:04:49.569> i<00:04:49.719> was<00:04:49.870> using

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
hair is very fine or maybe i was using

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.350 
hair is very fine or maybe i was using
the<00:04:50.229> wrong<00:04:50.520> strength<00:04:51.520> because<00:04:51.819> i<00:04:51.939> was<00:04:52.120> used

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
the wrong strength because i was used

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.510 
the wrong strength because i was used
regular<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.169> i<00:04:53.499> think<00:04:53.770> maybe<00:04:53.919> i<00:04:54.069> should<00:04:54.279> use

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
regular and i think maybe i should use

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.239 
regular and i think maybe i should use
mild<00:04:55.259> but<00:04:56.259> either<00:04:56.379> way<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.740> doesn't<00:04:56.800> matter

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
mild but either way it doesn't matter

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.119 
mild but either way it doesn't matter
because<00:04:57.849> my<00:04:58.120> hair<00:04:58.449> texture<00:04:59.289> is<00:04:59.499> fine<00:04:59.860> even

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:00.129 
because my hair texture is fine even

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.260 
because my hair texture is fine even
though<00:05:00.340> my<00:05:00.550> hair<00:05:00.759> is<00:05:00.849> kinky<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.539> still<00:05:01.870> fine<00:05:02.229> so

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
though my hair is kinky is still fine so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.420 
though my hair is kinky is still fine so
using<00:05:06.689> the<00:05:07.689> wrong<00:05:08.050> strength<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:09.279> know

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
using the wrong strength you know

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.339 
using the wrong strength you know
already<00:05:09.879> my<00:05:10.509> hair<00:05:10.749> is<00:05:10.840> at<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> disadvantage<00:05:11.259> so

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
already my hair is at a disadvantage so

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.140 
already my hair is at a disadvantage so
but<00:05:14.349> yeah<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.099> basically<00:05:15.310> i<00:05:15.699> was<00:05:15.969> using

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
but yeah so basically i was using

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.679 
but yeah so basically i was using
relaxers<00:05:16.990> incorrectly<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:18.639> decided<00:05:19.360> hey<00:05:19.629> if

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
relaxers incorrectly I decided hey if

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.110 
relaxers incorrectly I decided hey if
you<00:05:19.990> can't<00:05:20.229> use<00:05:20.409> it<00:05:20.590> correctly<00:05:20.860> stop<00:05:21.550> using<00:05:21.849> it

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
you can't use it correctly stop using it

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.110 
you can't use it correctly stop using it
so<00:05:22.449> I<00:05:22.479> stopped<00:05:22.990> using<00:05:23.199> it<00:05:23.500> cut<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:23.979> all<00:05:24.099> off<00:05:24.129> and

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
so I stopped using it cut it all off and

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600 
so I stopped using it cut it all off and
started<00:05:25.539> afresh<00:05:25.779> and<00:05:26.169> so<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.919> don't<00:05:27.279> know<00:05:27.460> like

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
started afresh and so I don't know like

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.640 
started afresh and so I don't know like
I<00:05:27.819> don't<00:05:27.849> regret<00:05:28.210> my<00:05:28.629> decision<00:05:28.659> I'm<00:05:29.379> actually
