 vinegar and 250 grams of amaranth and I 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.640
 we have because vegetable teak animal the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.829
 necessary for the materials that 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.420
 we need is the clay mold where 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.199
 you can buy with it already 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.690
 will 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.460
 plastic garters of course a case 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.739
 of copper that is the best you can not 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.690
 it has it does not matter they do not own it 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.670
 whatever is necessary if a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.070
 moment remember that the thermometer is 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.480
 very important and not good costs so 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.069
 expensive but it is important that you do not 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.800
 buy really have to have 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:59.170
 temperature of 200 degrees centigrade is 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.320
 very depressing and a palin in addition to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.150
 execution 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.820
 ingredients with the grace 2 100 grams 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.850
 sugar icing sugar skulls 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.130
 lemon glas lemon little corn of the great 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 isolated egg and egg mask 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.410
 vegetable color to taste ok and ready 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.960
 I 'll tell you the cost or 250 grams of 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.020
 piloncillo passed in 375 a tablespoon 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.750
 of vinegar 8 cents and 250 grams of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.630
 amaranth 1250 a spoonful of honey 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.600
 corn 5 cents tinfoil 20 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.539
 cents if it gives us a return of 16 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.119
 pieces 30 grams per piece and has a 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.180
 total cost of 16 pesos with 58 cents 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.750
 the fund because it's from a few pesos with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.869
 3 cents and the value of 20 of 5 pesos a 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.700
 10 out of 5 in the sale value goes to 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.930
 depend on the mold was small can 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.210
 be great you are going to have to 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.979
 calculate how much amaranth they carry and I 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.410
 what I do is I do the cleat 20 after 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.690
 the weight for you to see the weight 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.970
 of the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.890
 of the figure and after I have the weight 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.600
 then with the costing that I have 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.040
 final I divide it between the pieces that I 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.040
 they come out very important 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.760
 the vinegar the vinegar ok let's do 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.740
 the same thing that yesterday mouse we are going to take to 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
 blasting point although I already brought a 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.730
 honey made here is being made but already 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.700
 got mine now what we will do 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.530
 I have here pc 30 grams then 25 30 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.530
 grams of amaranth I'm going to put here 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.040
 by parties do not come with yale because we 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.860
 will win at the temperature 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.120
 another very good idea the mold I'm not going to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.980
 simply dunking what I did was 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.020
 Put on enough fat vegetable shortening 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.940
 all the furniture has digital butter 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.380
 I took advantage that today they are using lard 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.640
 remember there are less tamales we wanted 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.750
 can be with vegetable shortening that the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.970
 flavor of lard is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.410
 unparalleled salt or then if it 's 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.030
 using mind that the step is wrong 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.740
 it is then he took advantage and make his calaveritas 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.380
 from now also this hilarious being 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.380
 it can also be put in 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:20.270
 I'm going to put some honey here 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.270
 Hot hot for the amaranth 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.890
 look what I 'm going to do here is not 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.080
 so hot the sugar but you have to 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.990
 be about to blast as we did 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.220
 the test yesterday with the sugar just like I 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.000
 what he's going to do is put my hand in here 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.080
 to knead it for more randomly what 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.220
 It is well well kneaded so that our 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.210
 glue obviously a little bit more 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.800
 clear watching regularly is for 30 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.020
 grams of amaranth I take a 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.230
 half a spoonful of honey 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.820
 here is this is not so complex something 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.730
 important is that when I put the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.460
 amaranth with my chubby finger I have to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.360
 press them pretty well all right 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.310
 go liana and I go to pressure pressing 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.410
 see again full 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.180
 I have to press very well that I do not know 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.370
 move the mold because obviously it 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.140
 can move and we do not have much left 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.210
 Very complete 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.070
 see how it's going to be a little bit running 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.630
 but it does not matter what we're going to do 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.490
 perfectly 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.920
 we will make a dry shrinkage 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.570
 out there good does not matter 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.400
 Until there stay because there was a cut 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.900
