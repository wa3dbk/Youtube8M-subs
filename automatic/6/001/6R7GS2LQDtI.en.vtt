00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello how about band how are my name 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.389
 is 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.520
 gamer and be welcome to this new 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.350
 video in which I will show you a type 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.990
 He is very efficient with my first 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.180
 this trick, as it is called, can be 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.180
 use in all genres but I think it's 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.910
 more effective since turn 2 halo 4 and good 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.640
 basically consists of making a kind of 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.330
 wisco canceling the double zoom that has 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.850
 the sniper as we all know when aiming 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.460
 with the sniper we have a double zoom that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.059
 mainly to eliminate enemies 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.790
 long distances but usually what 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.420
 we use when we see a short enemy 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.280
 medium distance and this is a mistake to 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.460
 unless you're very good with the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.199
 sniper do this short time and 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.450
 skill when trying to win 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.970
 that death 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.120
 so the quiz trick or look 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.100
 canceled is basically stop doing 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.090
 double click with the right joystick 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.710
 which is what we use for the zoom 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.410
 let's say that this black box is the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.830
 objective what we are going to do to 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.500
 cancel the double zoom is basically 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 leave the right joystick pressed so 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.740
 of single without double- clicking 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.720
 we see that when we do this the look 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.360
 from the first the last one click 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.869
 and with this we do not waste time with the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.450
 double sun but eye to do this not 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.700
 we have a stable look since it is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.250
 difficult to keep the joystick pressed 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 and at the same time try to move it as 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.570
 We usually do it for 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.150
 my recommendation, I suggest you do not 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.700
 try to use this trick all the time 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.700
 I mean to go running with the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.830
 right joystick pressed always already 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.470
 this will cause them to wear the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.890
 lever and eventually it will be 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.319
 defective good we go a little with the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.079
 quiz cope again 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.879
 very good when we aim with the double 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.579
 sumo canceled what we will do is 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.400
 try to move the sights closer 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:22.450
 possible of the head or any part 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.480
 of the enemy's torso when we have the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.380
 clear goal just shoot and 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.410
 stop pressing the joystick 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.740
 but here is the trick this should be 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.710
 at least in a second I will show you 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.840
 a current example 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.060
 as they realized it is not trying 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.790
 keep looking steady until you find 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.830
 the right time to shoot is only 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.960
 look at the objective and try to move 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.270
 our gaze to the enemy leave 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.640
 pressed the right joystick and 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.580
 quickly shoot is not so 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.580
 complicated in fact it's too much 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.450
 simple and even many of you already 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.790
 they know this type of shots they use 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.250
 too professional players to 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.060
 make instant deaths or get 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.950
 multi deaths up may vary may 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.740
 shoot with chris cobb to the torso of 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.530
 enemy leave it to one shot change to br 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.410
 and killing him is only a matter of practice and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.050
 constancy with his shots while more 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.420
 do more are going to improve so I hope 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.850
