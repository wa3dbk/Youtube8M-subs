00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.100
 hello do you know models 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.300
 main characters wulff dallas 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.720
 own chainz 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.660
 the developers have made themselves begin 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.330
 from the first part namely for heist herself 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.820
 the game on its mechanics are very similar to f1 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.860
 we also have a cooperative shooter on 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 four in which common forces 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.690
 trying to fend off endless 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.360
 nods bots equally in them and 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.760
 backlight mates and enemies as well 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.370
 things like first-aid kits and ammo bags 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.739
 but despite some similarities 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.290
 idea was not developed on source 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.320
 in one of the missions namely in the robbery 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.909
 the bank will contact us a man who is on 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.979
 each task gives advice and 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.650
 recommendations how to act in this or 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.900
 different situation he will tell us that for 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.810
 getting the key card we need to kill 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.760
 either tie the bank manager interesting 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.370
 the fact is that if we kill 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.770
 employee then charge us penalty points 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.350
 for killing civil but lucky 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.000
 says nothing about it however 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.940
 if you remember for killing any 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.400
 innocent we are charged a fine and lucky 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.120
 surely it will comment perhaps 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.890
 this is a bug or some kind of flaw in the game 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.110
 sometimes given out by the action of the current can 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.720
 scream don't tease me bro 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.580
 this phrase was borrowed from andrew 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.880
 mayor party to one incident 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.520
 September 2007 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.960
 driving on youtube and wiki i found 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 information about what happened 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.150
 everything happened during the candidate's meeting 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.640
 for president of the united states john kerry with 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.770
 students of the university of florida mayor 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.730
 asked the senator many questions in 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.580
 including 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.440
 impeachment and the bush after which the police 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.780
 twisted the guy and used 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.060
 stun gun before 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.840
 Man electric shock, he cried just 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.840
 this phrase 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.310
 together and under cover by the main 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 computer, you can find a laptop with a card 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.650
 the edge is not anyway very similar 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.840
 on it we can assume that it is 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.870
 from there the developers decided to take it 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.900
 image and here is another interesting fact 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.310
 yutuber with nickname about perfect cheese game i 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.710
 discovered a toothbrush 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.370
 which exceeded in size 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.090
 normal sex even here these yourself 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.880
 I remain to take the developer after seeing it 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.940
 video updated game adding instead of old 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.400
 new broom size broomstick find it 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.400
 can be in the same room only in the bathroom 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.310
 Here is such a funny fact for the second part 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.470
 I found not many facts for example 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.140
 did you know that together rats have a number 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.240
 mistakes after all when mixing hydrogen chloride 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.600
 hydrochloric acid and caustic soda 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.760
 turns out water they are methamphetamine to that 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.810
 the same aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride calls 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.540
 hydrochloric acid 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.110
 because of what a funny thing turns out 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.020
 both of these substances seem to be the following two 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.720
 fact can be taken for Easter eggs but I 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.030
 decided to include their release first one 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 of locker opponents is very similar to 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.620
 agents from the third tier remember 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
 splinter cell it also has 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.410
 special 3 focal glasses green 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.840
 glow 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.280
 secondly in one of the objects the game was 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.480
 moved card from counter strike 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.600
 global offensive 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.100
 Namely, the bank card distinguishes the original from 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.410
 the one that is present in payday 2 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.290
 minimal and the name itself hints 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.510
 on to with robbery carries the name of goal 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.390
 the bank is easy to guess how 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.130
 stands for the word goal on the walls 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.450
 various robberies can be found 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.840
 following inscription 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.560
 this is a team of testers payday 2 and payday 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.330
 the heist 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.670
 did you know that the paintings are on display 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.560
 parade together set up with pictures on 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.260
 really are works really 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.750
 existing artists it was 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.060
 The last fact of the payday game series is not 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.550
 forget that I do not take Easter eggs 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.800
 if i missed something 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.110
 post in the comments and do not forget 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.740
 write a game that may fall into 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.830
 the next board release 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.830
 ago
