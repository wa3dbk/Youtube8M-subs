00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
program and I came in today knowing that

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.189 
program and I came in today knowing that
it<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.609> everything<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.029> had<00:00:24.240> into<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199

it just went I'm done I can't believe I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.999 
it just went I'm done I can't believe I
can't<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.990> hard<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> even<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.949> I

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
can't it's hard to even think about it I

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.670 
can't it's hard to even think about it I
mean<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.610> much<00:00:33.050> effort<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.320> squeezed

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
mean it was so much effort was squeezed

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.119

into<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.190> last<00:00:35.399> three<00:00:36.149> months<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:36.630> life

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.619

think<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:43.399> today<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> had<00:00:45.300> me<00:00:45.480> do

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
think about it today what it had me do

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.590 
think about it today what it had me do
is<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.110> work<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.370> 95<00:00:47.820> percent<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.390> hit

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is a work up to 95 percent then hit

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.830 
is a work up to 95 percent then hit
three<00:00:48.809> sets<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> four<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> quote<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
three sets of four and the quote that I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.430 
three sets of four and the quote that I
that<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.320> guy<00:00:52.590> who<00:00:52.770> wrote<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> program<00:00:53.940> said

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
that the guy who wrote the program said

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.779 
that the guy who wrote the program said
is<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:58.109> intense<00:00:58.469> phase<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.890> small<00:00:59.129> love<00:00:59.309> ends

because then you won't be able to reach

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.140 
because then you won't be able to reach
it<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
it and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.940 
it and
I<00:01:48.280> found<00:01:49.280> some<00:01:49.550> truths<00:01:50.230> in<00:01:51.230> myself<00:01:51.770> through

I found some truths in myself through

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.620 
I found some truths in myself through
this<00:01:52.100> program<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.470> way<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.830> only<00:01:54.860> an

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
this program in a way that only an

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.120 
this program in a way that only an
extreme<00:01:56.630> amount<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:57.110> effort<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.360> and<00:02:00.130> work

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
extreme amount of effort and and work

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.430 
extreme amount of effort and and work
can<00:02:01.700> really<00:02:01.730> reveal<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.900> some<00:02:02.930> truths

can really reveal to you some truths
about<00:02:03.560> yourself<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:05.090> figured<00:02:05.450> something

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
about yourself and I figured something

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
about yourself and I figured something
out<00:02:05.870> about<00:02:06.160> about<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.280> fear<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.550> failure<00:02:07.880> and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
out about about the fear of failure and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.070 
out about about the fear of failure and
it<00:02:09.710> is<00:02:09.950> if<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:11.390> are<00:02:11.540> not<00:02:11.780> afraid<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.800> fail<00:02:14.080> you

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
it is if you are not afraid to fail you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.710 
it is if you are not afraid to fail you
can<00:02:15.110> accomplish<00:02:15.920> anything<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.690> are

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
can accomplish anything if you are

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.330 
can accomplish anything if you are
willing<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.290> push<00:02:18.650> yourself<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.250> point

before I was not able to get for a solid
set<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.220> one<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:27.000> speaks<00:04:27.300> for<00:04:27.450> itself<00:04:27.750> and

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
set of one so that speaks for itself and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.450 
set of one so that speaks for itself and
it<00:04:28.230> has<00:04:28.290> nothing<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.710> do<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.070> doesn't<00:04:29.220> matter

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
it has nothing to do it doesn't matter

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.710 
it has nothing to do it doesn't matter
the<00:04:29.610> program<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.120> doesn't<00:04:30.270> matter<00:04:30.510> anything

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the program it doesn't matter anything

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.880 
the program it doesn't matter anything
it's<00:04:30.960> just<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.230> amount<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.530> effort<00:04:31.680> that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
it's just the amount of effort that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.340 
it's just the amount of effort that
you're<00:04:31.980> willing<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.250> put<00:04:32.400> in<00:04:32.720> any<00:04:33.720> program<00:04:34.140> can

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
you're willing to put in any program can

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.840 
you're willing to put in any program can
work<00:04:34.530> if<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.830> commit<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.280> fully<00:04:35.580> I

work if you commit to it fully I

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.350 
work if you commit to it fully I
strongly<00:04:36.810> believe<00:04:37.200> that<00:04:37.370> but<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:39.000> is<00:04:39.180> one<00:04:39.330> of

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
strongly believe that but this is one of

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.970 
strongly believe that but this is one of
those<00:04:39.600> programs<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.590> don't<00:04:40.770> have<00:04:40.890> a

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
those programs that you don't have a

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.410 
those programs that you don't have a
choice<00:04:41.130> but<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.460> commit<00:04:41.760> fully<00:04:41.910> because<00:04:42.300> it

choice but to commit fully because it

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.210 
choice but to commit fully because it

you<00:04:53.100> see<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.280> had<00:04:53.460> 340<00:04:54.420> for<00:04:54.720> my<00:04:54.840> sets<00:04:55.170> of<00:04:55.290> five

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
you see I had 340 for my sets of five

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.880 
you see I had 340 for my sets of five
here<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.340> bench<00:04:56.840> as<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.170> sets<00:04:58.410> went<00:04:58.590> on<00:04:58.710> they

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
here on bench as the sets went on they

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.890 
here on bench as the sets went on they
got<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.070> little<00:04:59.280> bit<00:04:59.400> better<00:04:59.580> my<00:05:00.120> first<00:05:00.390> set<00:05:00.630> I

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
got a little bit better my first set I

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.800 
got a little bit better my first set I
was<00:05:01.830> having<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.130> hard<00:05:02.310> time<00:05:02.420> you<00:05:03.420> know<00:05:03.450> kind<00:05:03.750> of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
was having a hard time you know kind of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.960 
was having a hard time you know kind of
finding<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.410> groove<00:05:04.620> in<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.220> pressing<00:05:05.730> but

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
finding the groove in the pressing but

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.480 
finding the groove in the pressing but
by<00:05:06.780> this<00:05:06.840> third<00:05:07.470> set<00:05:07.740> things<00:05:08.100> were<00:05:08.220> feeling

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
by this third set things were feeling

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.710 
by this third set things were feeling
pretty<00:05:08.520> good<00:05:10.970> overall<00:05:11.970> after<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.450> squatting

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
pretty good overall after the squatting

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.420 
pretty good overall after the squatting
I<00:05:12.930> really<00:05:13.590> didn't<00:05:13.830> even<00:05:13.860> care<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.220> whole<00:05:14.370> lot

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
I really didn't even care a whole lot

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.770 
I really didn't even care a whole lot
about<00:05:14.580> that<00:05:14.850> mention<00:05:15.150> because<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.420> was<00:05:15.540> just<00:05:15.660> so

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
about that mention because I was just so

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.340 
about that mention because I was just so
I<00:05:16.430> was<00:05:17.430> on<00:05:17.550> such<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.790> mental<00:05:18.150> high<00:05:18.270> from<00:05:18.510> it<00:05:18.660> but

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
I was on such a mental high from it but

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.310 
I was on such a mental high from it but
after<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:20.310> put<00:05:20.610> on<00:05:20.640> 315<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.570> decided<00:05:22.260> I

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
after that I put on 315 and decided I

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.900 
after that I put on 315 and decided I
was<00:05:22.440> going<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.620> pursue<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.920> lifetime<00:05:23.490> goal<00:05:23.730> of

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
was going to pursue a lifetime goal of

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.950 
was going to pursue a lifetime goal of
mine

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960

I<00:05:24.990> have<00:05:25.260> never<00:05:25.470> been<00:05:25.710> able<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.950> benchpress<00:05:26.280> 315

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
I have never been able to benchpress 315

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.580 
I have never been able to benchpress 315

the<00:05:28.830> form<00:05:29.040> was<00:05:29.420> there<00:05:30.420> have<00:05:30.510> been<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.660> few<00:05:30.900> times

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
the form was there have been a few times

the form was there have been a few times
in<00:05:31.380> my<00:05:31.410> life<00:05:31.500> where<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:33.020> know<00:05:34.020> where<00:05:34.350> my

benching was not as as consistent and
solid<00:05:37.890> where<00:05:38.040> I<00:05:38.070> get<00:05:38.400> up<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.640> maybe<00:05:38.850> eight<00:05:39.150> or

the<00:05:44.580> prettiest<00:05:44.880> set<00:05:45.090> that<00:05:45.240> I've<00:05:45.330> ever<00:05:45.420> done

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
the prettiest set that I've ever done

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.960 
the prettiest set that I've ever done
but<00:05:46.290> I<00:05:46.350> hit<00:05:46.530> ten<00:05:46.800> it's<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.220> lifetime<00:05:47.430> goal<00:05:47.820> of

but I hit ten it's a lifetime goal of

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.120 
but I hit ten it's a lifetime goal of
mine<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.480> hopefully<00:05:49.350> someday<00:05:49.590> I'll<00:05:49.860> be<00:05:50.010> able

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
mine and hopefully someday I'll be able

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.330 
mine and hopefully someday I'll be able
to<00:05:50.400> do<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.640> a<00:05:50.670> little<00:05:50.790> cleaner<00:05:51.560> but<00:05:53.150> overall

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
to do it a little cleaner but overall
