stitch zigzag and whatnot also if you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.900 
stitch zigzag and whatnot also if you
just<00:00:27.359> turn<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.349> stitches<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.730> see

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
just turn off your stitches you can see

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630 
just turn off your stitches you can see
the<00:00:30.029> wireframe<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> screen<00:00:31.130> let's<00:00:32.130> turn

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the wireframe on the screen let's turn

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
the wireframe on the screen let's turn
the<00:00:32.790> stitches<00:00:33.149> back<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> wireframe

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the stitches back on and the wireframe

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.060 
the stitches back on and the wireframe
off<00:00:34.800> let's<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> soon<00:00:36.210> total<00:00:36.660> okay<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.710> say

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
off let's do it soon total okay so say

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.030 
off let's do it soon total okay so say
that<00:00:38.250> you're<00:00:38.430> working<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.030> design<00:00:39.450> in

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
that you're working on this design in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.670 
that you're working on this design in
very<00:00:41.040> common<00:00:41.940> scenario<00:00:42.270> when<00:00:43.020> working<00:00:43.320> with

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
very common scenario when working with

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.400 
very common scenario when working with
say<00:00:44.100> letters<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.110> probably

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
say letters like this would be probably

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740 
say letters like this would be probably
for<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> zoom<00:00:47.430> into<00:00:47.670> different<00:00:48.239> corners

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
for you to zoom into different corners

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
for you to zoom into different corners
of<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.710> particularly<00:00:50.550> where<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of your you know particularly where the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
of your you know particularly where the
letters<00:00:51.149> connect<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> double

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
letters connect and you want to double

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
letters connect and you want to double
check<00:00:53.219> make<00:00:53.730> sure<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:54.449> block

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
check make sure you got the right block

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.830 
check make sure you got the right block
stitches<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.270> place<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
stitches or the right place for the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.349 
stitches or the right place for the
letters<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> connect<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> way<00:00:59.789> sometimes

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
letters to connect by the way sometimes

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.240 
letters to connect by the way sometimes
when<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> look<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.949> sure

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
when you look at this you're not sure

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
when you look at this you're not sure
where<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.270> whether<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.899> letter

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
where you know whether that letter

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
where you know whether that letter
connects<00:01:04.890> over<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> next<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
connects over to the next from that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.410 
connects over to the next from that
point<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.950> point<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:09.210> turn

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
point or from that point you can turn

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
point or from that point you can turn
your<00:01:09.630> connectors<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.670> dotted

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
your connectors on and you get dotted

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
your connectors on and you get dotted
lines<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.439> shows<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.979> exactly

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
lines for you know it shows you exactly

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
lines for you know it shows you exactly
where<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:15.090> embroidery<00:01:15.659> machine<00:01:16.049> would<00:01:16.619> make

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
where your embroidery machine would make

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
where your embroidery machine would make
that<00:01:17.159> connect<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> you're<00:01:19.110> looking<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.439> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that connect so you're looking at this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
that connect so you're looking at this
and<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.420> edit<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and you know you do your edit and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.640 
and you know you do your edit and
whatnot<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.590> know

way back out and then you know soon back

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
way back out and then you know soon back
into<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> different<00:01:32.970> corner<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.780> design

zoomed in on your design like if I were

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.139 
zoomed in on your design like if I were
to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> zoom<00:02:00.869> total<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:01.530> design<00:02:02.149> notice

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to do a zoom total in my design notice

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.069 
to do a zoom total in my design notice
how<00:02:03.360> now<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:03.930> box<00:02:04.729> ok<00:02:05.729> allows<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.780> draw<00:02:07.049> my

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
how now my box ok allows me to draw my

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.710 
how now my box ok allows me to draw my
own<00:02:07.439> box<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.009> that's<00:02:08.220> basically<00:02:08.789> how<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> can

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
own box and that's basically how you can

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
own box and that's basically how you can
use<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.319> satellite<00:02:10.950> view

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
use your satellite view

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.550 
use your satellite view
if<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.030> zoom<00:02:12.300> into<00:02:12.480> any<00:02:12.629> corner

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
if you zoom into any corner

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.250 
if you zoom into any corner
right<00:02:13.830> there<00:02:14.040> between<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.790> da<00:02:15.260> watch

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
right there between the I and da watch

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.760 
right there between the I and da watch
how<00:02:16.530> my<00:02:16.770> satellite<00:02:17.370> view<00:02:18.050> reflects<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.349> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
how my satellite view reflects that and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.010 
how my satellite view reflects that and
it<00:02:20.010> gives<00:02:20.190> me<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.400> little<00:02:20.910> box<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.480> once<00:02:21.780> I'm

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it gives me that little box so once I'm

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.040 
it gives me that little box so once I'm
done<00:02:22.380> checking<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.400> corner<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.660> need<00:02:24.870> to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
done checking that corner if I need to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.500 
done checking that corner if I need to
move<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.680> connection<00:02:26.610> point<00:02:26.910> between<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
move to the connection point between the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.900 
move to the connection point between the
a<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> end<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.340> grab<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
a and the end I can just grab that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.970 
a and the end I can just grab that
actual<00:02:30.360> box<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.989> move<00:02:31.170> all<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.500> way<00:02:31.530> over

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
actual box and move all the way over

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.520 
actual box and move all the way over
here<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:33.239> move<00:02:33.360> all<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> way<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.110> can

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
here I can move all the way here I can

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.710 
here I can move all the way here I can
pan<00:02:34.890> my<00:02:35.220> way<00:02:35.430> around<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.910> design<00:02:36.269> if<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.540> need

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
pan my way around the design if I need

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.949 
pan my way around the design if I need
to<00:02:36.870> check<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.470> dot<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.640> eye<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.750> just

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
to check the dot on that eye I can just

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.979 
to check the dot on that eye I can just
go<00:02:40.170> right<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.130> without<00:02:41.940> seeing<00:02:42.690> my

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
go right to it so without seeing my

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.920 
go right to it so without seeing my
whole<00:02:43.260> design<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> screen<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.390> satellite

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
whole design on the screen the satellite

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.590 
whole design on the screen the satellite
view<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.530> great<00:02:46.830> way<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.130> pan<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:48.480> know

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
view it's a great way to pan you know

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.320 
view it's a great way to pan you know
around<00:02:49.080> my<00:02:49.350> design<00:02:49.769> particularly<00:02:50.760> when

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
around my design particularly when

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.320 
around my design particularly when
you're<00:02:51.540> zooming<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.290> okay<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.670> retain

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
you're zooming in okay so you can retain

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.600 
you're zooming in okay so you can retain
the<00:02:54.690> zoom<00:02:55.380> level<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.069> you're<00:02:56.310> comfortable

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the zoom level that you're comfortable

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.470 
the zoom level that you're comfortable
with<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.980> can<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.250> keep<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.090> just

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
with and you can just keep that and just

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.479 
with and you can just keep that and just
move<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.900> different<00:03:01.049> areas<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.860> your<00:03:02.099> design

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
move to different areas of your design

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.120 
move to different areas of your design
it's<00:03:03.030> also<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.299> quick<00:03:03.599> way<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.140> go<00:03:04.500> from<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:04.920> end

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it's also a quick way to go from one end

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.039 
it's also a quick way to go from one end
of<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> design<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.910> other<00:03:06.150> say<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.720> you

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
of the design to the other say that you

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.039 
of the design to the other say that you
know<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.230> check<00:03:07.650> at<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.340> end<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> e<00:03:09.049> okay

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
know you check at the end of the e okay

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.539 
know you check at the end of the e okay
because<00:03:10.230> that's<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.709> end<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> first<00:03:11.280> word

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
because that's the end of the first word

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.660 
because that's the end of the first word
you<00:03:11.819> may<00:03:12.060> want<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.330> make<00:03:12.510> sure<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.959> there's<00:03:13.260> a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
you may want to make sure that there's a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.420 
you may want to make sure that there's a
lock<00:03:14.670> stitch<00:03:14.970> or<00:03:15.269> dreams<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.840> whatnot

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
lock stitch or dreams and whatnot

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.470 
lock stitch or dreams and whatnot
actually<00:03:17.430> looks<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.970> e<00:03:18.000> source

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
actually looks that the e source

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.670 
actually looks that the e source
backwards<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> F<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.340> from<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> F<00:03:21.680> okay

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
backwards to the F and from the F okay

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.289 
backwards to the F and from the F okay
that's<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.100> lock<00:03:23.310> stitch<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> F<00:03:24.030> right

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
that's the lock stitch of the F right

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.300 
that's the lock stitch of the F right
there<00:03:24.540> let's<00:03:25.109> turn<00:03:25.350> our<00:03:25.530> trains<00:03:25.829> on<00:03:26.040> let's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
there let's turn our trains on let's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.699 
there let's turn our trains on let's
save<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.519> yeah<00:03:27.090> okay<00:03:27.510> looks<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.350> that's<00:03:28.560> a

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
save that yeah okay looks like that's a

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.430 
save that yeah okay looks like that's a
lock<00:03:28.890> stitch<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.370> that's<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.670> trim<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.030> F

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
lock stitch and that's the trim on the F

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.590 
lock stitch and that's the trim on the F
before<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.560> moves<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> dot<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.640> eye<00:03:32.670> so

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
before it moves to the dot of the eye so

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.330 
before it moves to the dot of the eye so
now<00:03:33.870> say<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.470> want<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.709> check<00:03:34.980> at<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
now say that you want to check at the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.789 
now say that you want to check at the
end<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.819> word<00:03:36.030> Alliance<00:03:36.630> okay<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.590> can

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
end of the word Alliance okay you can

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.690 
end of the word Alliance okay you can
just<00:03:38.040> either<00:03:39.049> drag<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.530> box<00:03:40.859> over<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.519> you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
just either drag that box over or you

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.280 
just either drag that box over or you
can<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.060> come<00:03:42.239> over<00:03:42.269> here<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.720> draw<00:03:43.139> your

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
can just come over here and draw your

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.580 
can just come over here and draw your
own<00:03:43.470> box<00:03:43.709> okay<00:03:44.370> notice<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:45.170> whichever<00:03:46.170> size

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
own box okay notice that whichever size

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.970 
own box okay notice that whichever size
of<00:03:46.980> box<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.639> draw<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.299> instantly<00:03:49.019> reflects<00:03:49.739> in

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
of box I draw it instantly reflects in

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.210
