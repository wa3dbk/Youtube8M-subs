 extreme is on breakfast and recently 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.639
 someone else asked me if I was 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 not because my fans tick idea 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.480
 somehow present a video 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.769
 would like and there is just vacation and have 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.240
 the breakfast with me really always one 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 a bit more elaborate, I thought 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.529
 I hey I'll show you something simple 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.000
 something more elaborate and what 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.890
 more elaborate to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 Have breakfast both the weekend 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 could do and I hope you like it 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.840
 you and you are now inspired and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 we're going to eat now 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 let's start with the simplest 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 is a kind of yogurt oatmeal 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 The fruit will be very short 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
 we need something for a short time 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.570
 I have now taken an apple 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.730
 and the pear orange with too right 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.399
 good and we just cut the things 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.899
 small when you need to cut small on it 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.129
 Pay attention that they are really bite-sized 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 it becomes clear because we are doing so now 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 a type of oatmeal yoghurt stuff in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
 the direction and we do not want 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.289
 we still have huge pieces 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.070
 we have to cut them we are yes 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.899
 lazy people 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.180
 We are many people and if you are 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 because your fruit in small pieces 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.629
 has cut continue with the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.979
 Yogurt otherwise something in a yogurt 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 or quark what he likes most 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.909
 makes a still a yogurt 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.490
 a bit milky creamy seminar with me 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.689
 stand there somehow 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.130
 and now comes the cool namely Sun 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.869
 a species must be a trouble so I am 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 just so tender oatmeal and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.720
 Of course, you can also do yours 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.400
 take favorite bit but I am 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 that there are so through these tracks still 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.080
 short and now comes something completely 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.060
 great and we take it now 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 hazelnut grated more stuff like this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.750
 bit on top of it you can also 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.400
 make walnuts or something 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 But funny is cool because that gives 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.810
 Once again a person's deep taste 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.729
 and then we have our fruit too 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.040
 still, it really takes care of them 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.990
 Do not take too much because you overestimate 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.329
 you so an apple is already enormous me 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.619
 I took a half because of that 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.030
 he expects good and if we do that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.500
 We could have touched everything 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.259
 eat and i do not know i would do that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.820
 I prolong that in that 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.280
 video was the second time I think so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.750
 that did or the third time and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.229
 I'm the first to come up with her 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.700
 the child then bless you and that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.399
 It's pretty easy in the morning 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.099
 fails and is very rich in vitamins and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.110
 good for energy for the day now 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.550
 comes a bit more elaborate and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.050
 while we are doing porridge now if you are 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.280
 my real recipe 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.900
 want to know then looks briefly times the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.850
 info box or click on the screen 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290
 there you know how we do that I am 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.150
 just a little something to give 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.070
 so to speak, we are taking it now 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.210
 again hazelnut grated but this time 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.860
 we have to be careful that is 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.960
 grated nuts are and give the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.930
 really a big share to that, then 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.220
 so because not 1 to 3 so to speak so 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.300
 already a lot that we then 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.570
 mix it up like that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.360
 connection from nut mail janus more 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.070
 so to speak and oatmeal is and so 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.320
 Let's cook ours, so to speak 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.550
 porridge so we do as normal as 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.950
 said the recipe you can 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 I look and I do not know if I can 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.190
 mentioned in a video before 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.930
 but I think that tastes good with cacau 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.790
 connection with the nuts still 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.750
 Much better because that's me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.850
 a little bit on such a candy bar 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.310
 recalls if we is also something then 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.200
 could try that too and that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.550
 looks at the end so he sees 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.650
 but tastes a bit unappetizing 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.650
 Damn good by these nuts gives that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 just really something really delicious 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 chocolatige it even if actually 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.580
 cacau is 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.470
 [Music] 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.050
 Now we can do something more elaborate 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 Do something and let us now 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.160
 vegetables or something English inspired 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.780
 So just take a look and that 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 we open the fridge and bring 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.930
 vegetables out you can take tomatoes 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.460
 I have paprika and carrots now 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.740
 taken because we just because you have 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.420
 then we need something else for that 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.650
 pan I like to take salt butter because 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.210
 that's a bit of spices 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.070
 it does not have to know that much anymore 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.230
 and we need a basin because we do 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.430
 and we catch the scrambled eggs with bacon 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.780
 first to advise our bacon zeugs 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.460
 if you are now vegetarian or vegan 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.200
 then you can this step 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.240
 I would skip the love 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.700
 but for the people who say it 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.590
 it is not really cool because there 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.390
 where we put our pools in it 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.800
 We also do our fried 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.820
 vegetables are in there now but what we have before 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.380
 must only times cut 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.610
 as you said you know how to believe 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.270
 i cut vegetables i think thats 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.570
 everyone is aware 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.580
 and then I have the first now 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.070
 little card roasted the basin 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.840
 fat and then the paprika has it 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.360
 Something disgusting tastes something damn 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.620
 good and then I really like doing it 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.209
 tomato paste still pure 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.410
 that gives a bit of spice and 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.570
 besides, there is a really cool one 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.430
 colors throughout and it just tastes good 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.320
 really delicious and if we do that then 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.790
 everything has steamed nice again 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.980
 have fried whatever you have 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.200
 death used it for technical terms build 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.330
 we make ours a pure one now and 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.100
 Although quite normal scrambled egg prefers to take 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.840
 three eggs when the much vegetable I have 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.370
 had a bit too little and that 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.620
 Please then spice it again because 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.700
 otherwise it will not be so tasty and then 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.650
 Let's just do it 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.540
 but looks a bit like nice 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.830
 but is a scrambled egg, so to speak 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.580
 So you can do it all the time 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.810
 stir and that looks like this at the end 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.880
 looks like that no longer i know 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.830
 not i got important and straight to 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.650
 happiness equals dinner is therefore 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.060
 That's fine, but I think so too 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.680
 the colors are totally beautiful 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.110
 not at all a scrambled egg proved what 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.390
 I do not know and this actually 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.920
 inspired for breakfast 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.620
 I promise now for one time 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.840
 video and if you are even more cool 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.490
 then ready to see ready meals 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.830
 you're losing yourself just like me 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.570
 The wind means oric recipe once 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.950
 Here you come to eat you can tell you eat 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.020
 That's why I'm calling for me 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.580
 hurry me a bit and then show 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.410

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.980
 idea for the school uni work or 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.480
 in between with avocado and crispy 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.810
 meat or tofu or whatever 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.860
 wanted to do it and then 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.630

 See you
