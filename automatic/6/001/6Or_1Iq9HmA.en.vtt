00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.020
 so how is my big scheringa the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:12.719
 have finished twice have now 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.280
 get new windows today and that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.089
 was a few too many that's why I look 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.760
 now that I have one more 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.020
 manage and the remaining Arab 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:28.250
 I do not need anything like that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.240
 heavy then a sharp knife and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.270
 I have another case like that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.270
 piece of the new one was cut off 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
 which it does not actually do 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 to let 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.379
 you look that way about the same 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.379
 Thickness is so it fits quite well now he 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.699
 then not quite so radical 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 because it's relatively short where you are 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:06.140
 then cuts a piece off then becomes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.200
 here just the split 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:15.890
 Marshall still take care of the fingers 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.890
 this is how it is used 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 I know you always have to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 to turn away but I have got there 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.530
 not so the experience i believe that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 knife was not sharp enough occupied 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.740
 until now you have to work too 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.909
 especially at the beginning, probably when 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 you do not have exercise like me 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:48.200
 now may have to be sometimes just one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.200
 cut a few times after 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:05.640
 so they ask down there that quickly 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:09.959
 are synonymous with the scissors necessary because 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.709
 She's out of that is just going to be like that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.709
 put in it 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 I have to go a little deeper 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.599
 and dries up faster if 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.150
 he's so strong up here now 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:42.120
 rausschaut now comes the thing of 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.099
 garbage bag for use shortly you should 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.330
 looks yes and then I always start like this 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:56.220
 binder is just around it 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:58.980
 another page is another one 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.440
 bud probably not that good because 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:11.549
 which then possibly expels now 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.290
 just quite works out it would be cool 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:26.209
 I have three here already 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:26.209
 Just take care of it 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.930
 so 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.890
 To end the front bag around 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.780
 I always do it down tight then 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.070
 here before a wet piece of goal 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.480
 One and the whole was not like that 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.230
 sweats still air gets here a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.470
 a few dollars 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.240
 that was already koliken profi 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.320
 am 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.180
 that worked out with the other two 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.500
 which we now always solid and at 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.960
 which is always the case that even more 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.420
 come buds have not sit there 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:24.090
 over there the other two 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.960
 I made that quick today 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.550
 one of two woods on the other one 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.340
 it comes and is not 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.930
 completely not here you can see it 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.130
 perhaps now comes in a 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.590
 Bud I still dare this 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:44.100
 I do not open it either 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.010
 know exactly how long it takes up to 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.720
 it by itself he prefers to stay too long 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.020
 let it be as real as something 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.020
 mess up 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.850
 I hope it helped you and me 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.070
 Highly recommend it so it is not 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.560
 as hard as it gets in the beginning 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.900
 Maybe think and that opens one 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.310
 really many new possibilities already 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.220
 Great what you can do 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.220
 plant so thank you for looking
