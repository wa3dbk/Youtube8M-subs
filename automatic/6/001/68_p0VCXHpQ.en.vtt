00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
where I didn't exercise all I did was

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.099 
where I didn't exercise all I did was
changed<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.400> diet<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.970> we're<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.750> over<00:00:18.960> the

changed my diet and we're going over the
the<00:00:19.439> results<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.279> test<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:21.330> show<00:00:21.539> what

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the results from that test to show what

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.990 
the results from that test to show what
happened<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.439> month<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:23.310> by<00:00:23.580> changed<00:00:23.910> my

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
happened in one month just by changed my

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.429 
happened in one month just by changed my
diet<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.720> I'll<00:00:24.960> let<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.199> there

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
diet so I'll let you think there

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
diet so I'll let you think there
probably<00:00:25.789> drew<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.880> some<00:00:27.090> times<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.359> said

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
probably drew up some times you said

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
probably drew up some times you said
that<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> Anita<00:00:28.439> Singh<00:00:28.769> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that because this is Anita Singh and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.890 
that because this is Anita Singh and
this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.130> why<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.400> emphasize<00:00:29.609> diet<00:00:30.269> over

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
this is why we emphasize diet over

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.609 
this is why we emphasize diet over
anything<00:00:31.170> else

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
anything else

Jews<00:00:32.340> labs<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:33.149> spectacular<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.290> 30<00:00:34.980> days<00:00:35.219> he

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
Jews labs are spectacular in 30 days he

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.940 
Jews labs are spectacular in 30 days he
did<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.149> beg<00:00:36.540> people<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.410> years

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
did what we beg people to do for years

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.119 
did what we beg people to do for years
why<00:00:38.879> he<00:00:39.059> cleaned<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> eating<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:40.129> excessively

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
why he cleaned is eating up excessively

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
why he cleaned is eating up excessively
he<00:00:41.250> hasn't<00:00:41.460> even<00:00:41.520> had<00:00:41.700> an<00:00:41.820> exercise<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.300> wait

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
he hasn't even had an exercise it wait

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
he hasn't even had an exercise it wait
till<00:00:42.719> he<00:00:42.780> does<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.200> see<00:00:43.680> how<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:43.860> she's

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
till he does that see how much she's

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
till he does that see how much she's
improved<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> neat

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
improved if they can that's the neat

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
improved if they can that's the neat
thing<00:00:46.170> these<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.350> amazing<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.579> let's<00:00:47.730> start

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
thing these are amazing so let's start

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.060 
thing these are amazing so let's start
at<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> top<00:00:48.210> I'll<00:00:48.690> show<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.620> total

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
at the top I'll show you this total

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.930 
at the top I'll show you this total
cholesterol<00:00:50.280> went<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:50.940> 147<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.899> 116<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.940> LDL

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
cholesterol went from 147 to 116 is LDL

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080 
cholesterol went from 147 to 116 is LDL
or<00:00:54.180> bad<00:00:54.239> cholesterol<00:00:54.420> went<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.289> 80<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> 62<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
or bad cholesterol went from 80 to 62 is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.139 
or bad cholesterol went from 80 to 62 is
good<00:00:57.719> cholesterol<00:00:57.989> HDL<00:00:58.379> stayed<00:00:59.070> stable<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.789> 40

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
good cholesterol HDL stayed stable at 40

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
good cholesterol HDL stayed stable at 40
which<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.600> neat<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.109> usually<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.920> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
which is so neat because usually when we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.939 
which is so neat because usually when we
see<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> total<00:01:02.609> cholesterol<00:01:02.760> drop<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
see a total cholesterol drop like that

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
see a total cholesterol drop like that
HDL<00:01:04.949> cholesterol<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.489> good<00:01:05.670> cholesterol<00:01:05.909> also

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
HDL cholesterol or good cholesterol also

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.649 
HDL cholesterol or good cholesterol also
drops<00:01:07.020> drew<00:01:07.890> stayed<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> same<00:01:08.369> why<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.360> diet

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
drops drew stayed the same why good diet

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.340 
drops drew stayed the same why good diet
his<00:01:10.530> non<00:01:10.770> HDL<00:01:11.220> cholesterol<00:01:11.340> went<00:01:11.880> from<00:01:12.030> 107<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
his non HDL cholesterol went from 107 to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
his non HDL cholesterol went from 107 to
77<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.159> his<00:01:14.369> triglycerides<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> an

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
77 and his triglycerides which is an

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
77 and his triglycerides which is an
indicator<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.380> sugar<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.220> eating

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
indicator of how much sugar is eating

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.960 
indicator of how much sugar is eating
went<00:01:18.330> from<00:01:18.479> 132<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> 59<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.250> his<00:01:20.430> overall

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
went from 132 to 59 so his overall

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.429 
went from 132 to 59 so his overall
cholesterol<00:01:21.210> panel<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.780> absolutely

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cholesterol panel is absolutely

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.030 
cholesterol panel is absolutely
beautiful

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
beautiful
