same thing but this application is free
and<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.420> reason<00:00:39.629> why<00:00:40.140> I've<00:00:40.559> been<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and the reason why I've been kind of

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
and the reason why I've been kind of
hesitant<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.530> recommending<00:00:43.530> another<00:00:43.770> time

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
hesitant to recommending another time

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.470 
hesitant to recommending another time
lapse<00:00:45.620> program<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.670> haven't<00:00:48.090> tried

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
lapse program because I haven't tried

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
lapse program because I haven't tried
them<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.140> haven't<00:00:49.320> tried<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.890> one

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
them all I really haven't tried this one

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
them all I really haven't tried this one
however<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.000> free<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.350> mean<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
however this one is free so I mean it's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
however this one is free so I mean it's
not<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> hurt<00:00:53.190> anybody<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.270> download

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
not going to hurt anybody to download

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
not going to hurt anybody to download
sometimes<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> applications<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.370> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
sometimes the applications are really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.930 
sometimes the applications are really
good<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.960> Apple<00:00:58.640> releases<00:00:59.640> some

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
good and then Apple releases some

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
good and then Apple releases some
firmware<00:01:00.210> updates<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
firmware updates and then the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.500 
firmware updates and then the
application<00:01:02.430> gets<00:01:02.520> buggy<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
application gets buggy and then the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
application gets buggy and then the
company<00:01:03.930> made<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> maybe<00:01:05.070> they're<00:01:05.250> working<00:01:05.549> on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
company made it maybe they're working on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
company made it maybe they're working on
a<00:01:05.640> couple<00:01:05.820> other<00:01:06.030> applications<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.900> maybe<00:01:07.110> was
