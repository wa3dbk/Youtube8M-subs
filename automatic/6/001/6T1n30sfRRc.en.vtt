kind of find that hard to swallow

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.900 
kind of find that hard to swallow
because<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.070> if<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.400> take<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.820> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
because if you if you take it to the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.490 
because if you if you take it to the

going from the sludgy kind of dooming

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.050 
going from the sludgy kind of dooming
thing<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.100> when<00:05:29.190> he<00:05:29.250> hits<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.520> first<00:05:29.880> note

and<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.419> admits<00:05:30.990> it's<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.590> metal<00:05:31.890> moment<00:05:32.250> to

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
and I admits it's a metal moment to

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.969 
and I admits it's a metal moment to
behold<00:05:32.640> and<00:05:32.880> then<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.590> break-up<00:05:34.590> turquoise

I like is that they show that there's a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.130 
I like is that they show that there's a
little<00:05:53.760> bit<00:05:53.940> diversity<00:05:54.419> behind<00:05:54.750> their<00:05:54.900> sound

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140
