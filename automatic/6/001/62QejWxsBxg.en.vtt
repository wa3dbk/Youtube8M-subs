camera<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.429> i<00:00:14.490> just<00:00:14.700> had<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.940> big<00:00:15.179> bad<00:00:15.690> boy

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
camera so i just had this big bad boy

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.680 
camera so i just had this big bad boy
and<00:00:16.350> i<00:00:17.310> went<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.730> all<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> way<00:00:18.270> over<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and i went like all the way over to the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
and i went like all the way over to the
other<00:00:18.900> side<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> room<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.130> just

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
other side of the room and it was just

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
other side of the room and it was just
really<00:00:20.369> bad<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.060> i<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.810> pulled<00:00:21.990> out<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.260> my

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
really bad so i just pulled out like my

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.080 
really bad so i just pulled out like my
little<00:00:22.560> tiny<00:00:22.830> camera<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.310> i<00:00:23.340> log<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
little tiny camera that i log on and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570 
little tiny camera that i log on and
whatnot<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:25.039> can't<00:00:26.039> quality<00:00:26.369> might<00:00:26.490> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
whatnot so can't quality might be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880 
whatnot so can't quality might be
different<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.140> that's<00:00:28.470> been

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
different and I think that's been

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.230 
different and I think that's been
so<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> doing<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:29.970> update

so I'm just going to be doing an update

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.429 
so I'm just going to be doing an update

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
haul on the end just because I don't

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.850 
haul on the end just because I don't
know<00:00:33.300> early<00:00:33.630> rails<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.170> start<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.649> just

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
know early rails to start and I just

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860 
know early rails to start and I just
wanted<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> say<00:00:35.190> some<00:00:35.460> things<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.270> I'm<00:00:36.719> going

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
wanted to say some things so I'm going

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.510 
wanted to say some things so I'm going
to<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> most<00:00:37.530> obvious<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.280> um

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
to start with the most obvious one um

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.650 
to start with the most obvious one um
probably<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.750> did<00:00:40.530> die<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.950> hair<00:00:41.100> teal<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.910> it's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
probably I did die my hair teal so it's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.970 
probably I did die my hair teal so it's
kind<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> looking<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> weird<00:00:43.530> minty

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kind of looking like this weird minty

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.040 
kind of looking like this weird minty
green<00:00:44.129> color<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> dyed<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.510> because

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
green color but I dyed it to you because

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
green color but I dyed it to you because
a<00:00:46.260> few<00:00:46.440> weeks<00:00:46.559> ago<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.579> faded

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
a few weeks ago and so now it's faded

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.830 
a few weeks ago and so now it's faded
out<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.120> why<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
out that's why it looks like this and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.880 
out that's why it looks like this and
I'm<00:00:48.960> actually<00:00:49.079> probably<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.710> diet

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
I'm actually probably going to be diet

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.639 
I'm actually probably going to be diet
tonight<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.489> yeah<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> thought

have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> computer<00:01:25.830> sometimes<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.880> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
have a computer sometimes we can go on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.350 
have a computer sometimes we can go on
her<00:01:27.000> dance<00:01:27.180> which<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.780> weird<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
her dance which is really weird and you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.730 
her dance which is really weird and you
know<00:01:30.450> he's<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> most<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> time<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:31.650> not

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
know he's on a most of the time well not

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.899 
know he's on a most of the time well not
most<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> time<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.759> his

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
most of the time but you know it's his

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
most of the time but you know it's his
computer<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.780> constantly

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
computer we don't want to be constantly

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
computer we don't want to be constantly
on<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.579> harder<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.210> videos<00:01:36.630> up

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
on it so it is harder to get videos up

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.440 
on it so it is harder to get videos up
and<00:01:37.200> we're<00:01:38.100> also<00:01:38.310> leaving<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.210> vacation

and we're also leaving for vacation
again<00:01:39.810> tomorrow<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.159> probably<00:01:41.340> be

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
again tomorrow so this will probably be

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
again tomorrow so this will probably be
the<00:01:41.520> only<00:01:41.640> video<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.600> any<00:01:42.840> other<00:01:42.930> week<00:01:43.200> so
