00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
I don't like Dell very much but this is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.260 
I don't like Dell very much but this is
a<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.760> good<00:00:53.910> monitor<00:00:54.500> it's<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
a really good monitor it's kind of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.430 
a really good monitor it's kind of
hypocritical<00:00:57.270> or<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
hypocritical or I don't know what the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
hypocritical or I don't know what the
word<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.129> anyway<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.420> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
word is but anyway so you can see that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.660 
word is but anyway so you can see that
this<00:01:03.690> monitor<00:01:04.489> has<00:01:05.659> um

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.740 

this<00:01:11.270> port<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.400> I've<00:01:13.549> obviously<00:01:13.970> want<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
this port and so I've obviously want the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.810 
this port and so I've obviously want the
Apple<00:01:15.140> port<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.500> white<00:01:15.680> one<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.580> higher

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
Apple port the white one it's higher

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.940 
Apple port the white one it's higher
resolution<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.229> chose<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.280> buy<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:20.630> DVI

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
resolution so I chose to buy the DVI

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.690 
resolution so I chose to buy the DVI
which<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.159> this<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:22.670> left<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.700> let's

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
which is this is left but and so let's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.130 
which is this is left but and so let's
go<00:01:25.850> ahead<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.030> set<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.299> up<00:01:26.450> obviously<00:01:26.840> going

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
go ahead and set it up obviously going

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.719 
go ahead and set it up obviously going
to<00:01:27.229> want<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.470> plug<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:27.890> make<00:01:28.460> sure<00:01:28.490> your

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
to want to plug it in make sure your

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.490 
to want to plug it in make sure your
computer<00:01:29.149> is<00:01:29.180> uh<00:01:29.270> ah<00:01:32.229> there<00:01:33.229> we<00:01:33.350> go

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
we would wish which we finished I'm I

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.700 
we would wish which we finished I'm I
imported<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.210> into<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.930> old<00:04:04.110> iMovie<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:04.590> I

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
imported it into the old iMovie so I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.110 
imported it into the old iMovie so I
could<00:04:04.860> add<00:04:04.950> chapter<00:04:05.340> markers<00:04:05.610> for<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> DVD

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
could add chapter markers for the DVD

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.170 
could add chapter markers for the DVD
and<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.980> first<00:04:08.220> time<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> did<00:04:08.640> I<00:04:08.670> did<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.090> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and the first time I did I did in this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.030 
and the first time I did I did in this
weird<00:04:09.420> file<00:04:09.660> format<00:04:10.080> and<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.680> really<00:04:10.830> low

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
weird file format and so it's really low

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.520 
weird file format and so it's really low
quality<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.820> was<00:04:12.150> kind<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.420> worried<00:04:12.720> but

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
quality and I was kind of worried but

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.990 
quality and I was kind of worried but
then<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.710> did<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:13.950> again<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.490> it's<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.820> much

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
then I did it again and it's a much

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.400 
then I did it again and it's a much
higher<00:04:15.180> resolution<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:15.900> that's<00:04:16.049> why<00:04:16.200> there's

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
higher resolution so that's why there's

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.830 
higher resolution so that's why there's
two<00:04:16.470> are<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.980> same<00:04:17.100> windows<00:04:17.600> YouTube<00:04:18.600> video

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
two are the same windows YouTube video

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.000 
two are the same windows YouTube video
you<00:04:18.930> can't<00:04:19.170> really<00:04:19.320> tell<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.500> difference<00:04:19.590> but

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
you can't really tell the difference but

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:32.100 
you can't really tell the difference but
anyway<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.299> right<00:04:21.480> here<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.840> displays

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:46.380 

I<00:04:33.150> went

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:55.960 

now<00:04:47.410> that<00:04:53.890> so<00:04:54.890> there<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.130> have<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.460> it's<00:04:55.670> all

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
now that so there you have it it's all

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.310 
now that so there you have it it's all
calibrated<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:56.990> everything<00:04:59.020> see<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.110> works

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
calibrated and everything see it works

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.090 
calibrated and everything see it works
