 damage from the guys who were here for the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 mountain is really it's a 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.460
 structured way so the idea of ​​a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.660
 english adam islands mariannes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.789

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 explorations his study work done in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.289
 kind of feed his campo through 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 no more helicopter but simply 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.969
 paragliding with his companion adam he 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730

 considers almost 180 200 kg of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.939
 professionals here today 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 so twelve years ago there were 12 and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.070
 today we have two meanings that's it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.860
 money and I believe they change that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 change things then good like everything 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.180
 a whole evolve and consumption 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.110
 it's easy it's not trekking or 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 trekking it takes effort 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.070
 the Himalayan expedition worse 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 this is an accessible feeling if a 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.009
 direct sensation enough to pay 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.579
 few steps and that's it in the air 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.829
 time is an emotion 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 accessible at lower cost 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.600
 matter of will efforts they have 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.870
 understood that as the com himalayism 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.900
 com 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.670
 the trekking as the end the hot gold is 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.030
 a significant economic windfall for 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 himalaya 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.479
 what attracted you 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.110
 especially on a book in a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.230
 first time 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.710
 space aesthetics and proximity 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.800
 with its big massive corner possibility of 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.050
 still able to open doors remain 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.560
 creative have the imagination a 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.940
 positive imagination you think that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.090
 from the hills there in the corner 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.260
 you can go as far as taking back 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.030
 ascendances go as far as the areas 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.400
 to Machu Picchu to Burnat 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.560
 we can rely absolutely following way 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.080
 the period following the year the period 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.600
 in the year the conditions allow 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.300
 to reach very high ceilings 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.480
 altitude it was revealed on several 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.160
 places it's happening here actually 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.170
 there is what is the very high 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
 altitude very high altitude in bazaar 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.680
 thermal mass must be considered more than 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.690
 6000 meters 6500 meters the doors of the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.989
 7000 m here is the idea of ​​flying them 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.170
 in paragliding pokhara with you it's 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.209
 downright magical for me is to have 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.360
 met here is growing more 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.549
 extraordinary so you made them all 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.320
 fly to parent they look delighted and 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.120
 what do you think of his flights 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.159
 with his grandchildren palates 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.069
 these are flights that matter in life 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.920
 what are flights that we remember 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.940
 we simply have sails that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.640
 serves all are useful but these more 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.790
 especially in any case for oneself 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.790
 even 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.730
 it's true that now we come to a 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.800
 status for them who is able to better 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.750
 better because for success in 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.870
 the school is total she is 3 years old 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.280
 the unique university and now who 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.150
 works in a hospital that is 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.390
 nurse 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.830
 and then there thanks to xavier of 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.260
 cravings at pokhara we made them do a 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.960
 each flying a flying bill over the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.520
 lake a year what for some sort of thing 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.670
 absolutely exceptional when we see 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.230
 where they come from and their status when 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.330
 he was still on the ponds on 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.380
 last, that's for sure 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.490
 in the leisure to try me I saw 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.750
 in the train stations and make them 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.890
 discover what kind of activities that 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.010
 exceptional for themselves by 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.010
