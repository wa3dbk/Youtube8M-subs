00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
listen we're going to start off with a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.419 
listen we're going to start off with a
zoom<00:00:06.899> sculpture<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.859> comes<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.220> three

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
zoom sculpture and this comes in three

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.759 
zoom sculpture and this comes in three
different<00:00:08.550> parts<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.210> B<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.780> C<00:00:09.990> we're<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
different parts a B and C we're going to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.499 
different parts a B and C we're going to
mix<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.130> together<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.550> little<00:00:11.639> bit<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.389> B

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
mix it together a little bit of a and B

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.209 
mix it together a little bit of a and B
but<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.870> very<00:00:13.200> important<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.860> you're<00:00:14.009> using

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
but it's very important on you're using

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400 
but it's very important on you're using
this<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.670> wipe<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> spatula<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.599> between<00:00:15.929> you

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410

this to wipe the spatula in between you
don't<00:00:16.590> want<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> mix<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.250> product<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> then

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
don't want to mix this product and then

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.300 
don't want to mix this product and then
with<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.960> tiny<00:00:19.289> amount<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> C<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.160> going

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
with just a tiny amount of C I'm going

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830 
with just a tiny amount of C I'm going
to<00:00:20.430> mix<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> together<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.330> C<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.630> what

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
to mix that together and C is what

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170 
to mix that together and C is what
controls<00:00:22.289> how<00:00:23.039> thick<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.609> how<00:00:23.910> quickly

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
controls how thick it is and how quickly

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.029 
controls how thick it is and how quickly
it<00:00:24.390> dries<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.019> more<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.439> C<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it dries the more you have of C the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.759 
it dries the more you have of C the
slower<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> takes<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.789> dry<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
slower it takes to dry so I'm going to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
slower it takes to dry so I'm going to
