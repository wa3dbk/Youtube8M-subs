00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hey this is the weaver performer 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 original gws and how to assemble 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
 and some interesting facts about the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.540
 grill you will learn in this episode of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.230
 bathe cooke from rheinhessen 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.230
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.610
 -5 degrees and therefore just the right one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 outside grilles 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 here is the reformer original gws and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.510
 we need it together now before 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.640
 Let's have a look in the carton 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.640
 It was like cutting the carton up 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.280
 should first the instructions 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:25.090
 or the instructions for use 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.120
 and just the construction instruction all 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.170
 individual parts 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.770
 so I have everything from the carton 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.340
 exempt 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.260
 off you go with the dws grills of 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.900
 east with that still in the middle then have 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.280
 we have the boiler of 2015 model that 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.690
 recognize it by the thermometer and 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.430
 air intake on the opposite 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.780
 are side and then I have all 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.130
 other small parts we need 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.750
 here on my table and you 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.369
 See that's a whole lot 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.960
 tool we need a cross 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.759
 screwdriver an elf key 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.800
 a hammer and a little bit 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.020
 wood could handle when mounting the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.430
 shipowners leave all the items and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.430
 Now I need the grill together 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.280
 35 minutes later, the weaver performa 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.540
 original gws assembled one can 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.080
 Alone really relaxed in the time 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 create 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.440
 and now let's have a look 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.550
 more precisely the largest and of course 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.680
 most obvious difference to 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.600
 normal master day is the grill car 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.980
 on the road next to the performance 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.340
 Here is a little table and that is 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.780
 side of it too resilient and here 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.070
 you can see the fold 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.880
 I think that's cool 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.230
 save a little space and have a high 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.790
 pulled back apart otherwise the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.320
 said the dare down then you have 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.780
 another possibility where he has a bag 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.670
 or you can put wine here you have three 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.740
 hook where your bbq on it 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.840
 can attach and the boiler from 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.400
 Grill the look at us now before the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.690
 Grill open it is still short 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.480
 in my opinion most important 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.160
 innovation 2015 at the Weber models and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.420
 Although the thermometer is under 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 air outlet now on the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.630
 This was opposite sides earlier 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.130
 so that the thermometer here in the 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.240
 side was and if he used it two coal 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.700
 had worked baskets 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.110
 the yes then just laterally of these 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.270
 ventilation outlet should have stood 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.010
 So you a collegiate often directly under 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.450
 thermometer and so that was what it was 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.500
 thermometer has actually displayed 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.330
 completely witless 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.470
 that everyone has now realized that 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.180
 corrected, I think that's really great 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.130
 I had on the track last year 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.410
 and then it was clear to me that 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.080
 I definitely wait until 2015 model 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.000
 is outside and yes you have your side 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.400
 Do you have this ring again this day 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.989
 way lidels unfortunately that's what we mean 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.920
 also to hang the cover youth 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.489
 but lived the lid and pushes 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.070
 set it aside 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.300
 the grill holds him tight and so lies on 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.010
 it does not burn you on the ground 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.489
 I think grass is an absolute super 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.290
 history 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.510
 Now let's have a look below 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.430
 Her stainless steel the three wings that 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.660
 is the ventilation system with a lever 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.669
 So he could be there accordingly 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.250
 adjust how much air comes from below 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.630
 then I have the coal rust here 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.250
 is set 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.230
 and what I find very nice at the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.180
 Grill will be directly the coal body 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.070
 supplied and very big fan of 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.240
 have this code because he has 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.310
 just the possibility of the coal 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.140
 variable in usually to push against 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.669
 just as he would like to have her 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.230
 not every parquet or every single one 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.790
 Charcoal pieces are one with the pliers 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.770
 I find a really great grab 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.780
 history 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.240
 I think it's good that they are there then 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.379
 weber still provides such an aluschale 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.669
 that is certainly complete for the beginning 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.650
 great but not for eternity 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.270
 I recommend you one 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.740
 Visit the friendly Swedish 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.349
 furniture house that you get from stainless steel 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.180
 for little money what comparable and 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.039
 I use that for years and is 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.979
 certainly the best solution for me 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.500
 Last but not least, listen 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.180
 this is a gps device called gbs 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.409
 gourmet barbecues system and that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.449
 means that he is here in the middle 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.580
 you can take that out and 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.740
 just buy different inserts 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.199
 can and in rock or oven 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.000
 or a pizza stein or what's there 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.289
 because really possibilities the thing for 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.090
 as such, I think that's really great 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.490
 which I personally a bit sad 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.710
 think this is a weaver pro 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.710
 Forma ubs that means this grill 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.880
 costs the dealer 399 euro if 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.310
 I go to the dealer now and there 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.710
 then buy a weaver master touch 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.960
 costs the 299 euros and comes with a 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.060
 stainless steel why has this rust please 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.110
 only a chrome steel steed find 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.129
 I can be a pity too 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.539
 not quite understand 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.430
 at the side you have as usual 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.319
 generosity to open generously 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.460
 Just here to top up with coal or just 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.659
 refill with chips 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.669
 Of course that is a very good one 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.409
 history but as I said the thing is 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.569
 Chromed steel will certainly be 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.279
 a few years but I think 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.659
 in rain use is then after a 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.639
 couple of years really ending and you 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.050
 you have to buy new post and then 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.729
 Of course you can choose stainless steel 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.310
 to buy that one would have directly on 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.620
 So the weaver can solve the beginning 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.240
 performance original gws i hope you 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.529
 has the video to unboxing ours 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.849
 I like the idea if that's the case 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.259
 I would be happy if video and 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.550
 Thumbs up would threaten me 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.259
 leave a friendly comment 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.849
 you should not subscribe mainz yet 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.409
 This could be up here now 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.940
 I would catch up in the corner 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.500
 we are so happy to see each other 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.599
 Thursday at 7 pm with one 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.340
 new video thank you all 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.590
 watching until next week is good 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.159
 he years ago from the barbecue rheinhessen 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.159
 See you
