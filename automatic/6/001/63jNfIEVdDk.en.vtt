analog input 0 if we switch over to
LabVIEW<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.000> see<00:00:21.150> I've<00:00:21.270> already<00:00:21.510> placed

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
LabVIEW you can see I've already placed

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080 
LabVIEW you can see I've already placed
my<00:00:21.869> DAC<00:00:22.380> assistant<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> block<00:00:23.550> diagram

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
my DAC assistant on the block diagram

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
my DAC assistant on the block diagram
and<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.769> detect<00:00:26.490> if

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and so what we want to do is detect if

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
and so what we want to do is detect if
our<00:00:27.029> temperature<00:00:27.480> has<00:00:27.840> crossed<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.680> certain

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
our temperature has crossed a certain

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.790 
our temperature has crossed a certain
threshold<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:30.000> limit<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> we'll<00:00:31.769> use

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
threshold or limit to do that we'll use

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
threshold or limit to do that we'll use
the<00:00:32.099> masking<00:00:32.520> limit<00:00:32.790> VI<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:33.840> click

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the masking limit VI so if I right click

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
the masking limit VI so if I right click
go<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.739> signal<00:00:35.160> analysis<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.969> we'll<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
go to signal analysis and we'll see the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
go to signal analysis and we'll see the
masking<00:00:37.500> limit<00:00:37.770> VI<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.390> we'll<00:00:39.390> place<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.570> on

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
masking limit VI and we'll place that on

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
masking limit VI and we'll place that on
the<00:00:39.870> block<00:00:40.110> diagram<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> will<00:00:41.100> pop<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the block diagram and it will pop up a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.000 
the block diagram and it will pop up a
dialog<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.629> select<00:00:42.780> from<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.649> upper

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
dialog where I can select from the upper

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.160 
dialog where I can select from the upper
or<00:00:44.040> lower<00:00:44.550> limit<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.629> case<00:00:45.870> we're<00:00:46.079> going

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
or lower limit in this case we're going

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
or lower limit in this case we're going
to<00:00:46.260> configure<00:00:46.559> an<00:00:46.890> upper<00:00:47.250> limit<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.670> define

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to configure an upper limit and define

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
to configure an upper limit and define
that<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> constant<00:00:49.469> value<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.219> when<00:00:50.370> we

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that as a constant value so when we

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
that as a constant value so when we
cross<00:00:51.230> 27<00:00:52.230> degrees<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.789> it'll<00:00:54.780> it'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
cross 27 degrees then it'll it'll

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.310 
cross 27 degrees then it'll it'll
trigger<00:00:55.379> our<00:00:55.649> alarm<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> next<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.230> we

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
trigger our alarm so the next thing we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
trigger our alarm so the next thing we
need<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.859> wire<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.460> our<00:00:59.609> data<00:01:00.030> signal<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
need to do is wire up our data signal to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.130 
need to do is wire up our data signal to
the<00:01:00.840> input<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.530> signals<00:01:02.160> input<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.780> then<00:01:03.780> I'm

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the input the signals input and then I'm

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.010 
the input the signals input and then I'm
actually<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.769> move<00:01:05.119> my<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.780> waveform

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
actually going to move my my waveform

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.399 
actually going to move my my waveform
graph<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> output<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> mask<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
graph to the output of the mask and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.270 
graph to the output of the mask and
limit<00:01:10.710> VI<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> will<00:01:13.680> display<00:01:14.010> my

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
limit VI this way it will display my

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
limit VI this way it will display my
limits<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.600> graph<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.470> my

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
limits on the graph as well as my

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.090 
limits on the graph as well as my
original<00:01:17.159> signal<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.409> now<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> indicate

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
original signal and now to indicate

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.719 
original signal and now to indicate
whether<00:01:20.460> our<00:01:21.259> actual<00:01:22.259> signal<00:01:22.619> value<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> below

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
whether our actual signal value is below

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.149 
whether our actual signal value is below
or<00:01:24.180> above<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.990> limit<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.590> use<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.950> pass

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
or above that limit we can use the pass

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.940 
or above that limit we can use the pass
foulon<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.659> below<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.350> limit<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
foulon so if it is below the limit it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.120 
foulon so if it is below the limit it
will<00:01:29.159> indicate<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:30.030> true<00:01:30.659> value<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
will indicate a true value so I can

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
will indicate a true value so I can
right<00:01:32.310> click<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.000> create<00:01:33.299> an<00:01:33.420> indicator

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
right click that and create an indicator

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.039 
right click that and create an indicator
and<00:01:34.110> it'll<00:01:34.890> create<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.430> LED<00:01:36.210> boolean<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.900> my

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and it'll create a LED boolean on my

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.749 
and it'll create a LED boolean on my
front<00:01:37.350> panel<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.240> when<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> run<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.869> VI

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
front panel and now when I run the VI

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
front panel and now when I run the VI
you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> see<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> by<00:01:42.360> default<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.110> boolean

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you can see that by default the boolean

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.370 
you can see that by default the boolean
value<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.159> true<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:45.060> my<00:01:45.750> temperature

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
value is true because my temperature

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
value is true because my temperature
signal<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> white<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.670> below

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
signal which is in the white is below

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.440 
signal which is in the white is below
the<00:01:48.899> threshold<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.520> our<00:01:50.610> case<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the threshold so in our case we want to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.630 
the threshold so in our case we want to
generate<00:01:52.110> alarm<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> value<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
generate alarm so we want the value to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.020 
generate alarm so we want the value to
be<00:01:53.759> true<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> above<00:01:55.649> our<00:01:55.890> threshold<00:01:56.399> so

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
be true if it is above our threshold so

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.280 
be true if it is above our threshold so
what<00:01:57.270> we're<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
what we're actually going to do is

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.280 
what we're actually going to do is
invert<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.310> value<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.990> right

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
invert that value and so I can right

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.620 
invert that value and so I can right

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
to turn on or off the line and so you'll

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.259 
to turn on or off the line and so you'll
notice<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:02.599> wizard<00:03:03.260> here<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.970> relay

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
notice on the wizard here that the relay

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.240 
notice on the wizard here that the relay
module<00:03:05.419> has<00:03:05.810> up<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.019> four<00:03:06.349> digital<00:03:06.739> lines<00:03:06.980> in

module has up to four digital lines in

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.649 
module has up to four digital lines in
this<00:03:07.669> case<00:03:07.879> we're<00:03:08.060> only<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.389> use<00:03:08.480> one

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
this case we're only going to use one

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.530 
this case we're only going to use one
and<00:03:10.359> then<00:03:11.359> we<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:11.689> hit<00:03:11.840> OK<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:13.299> then<00:03:14.299> when<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
and then we can hit OK and then when the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.559 
and then we can hit OK and then when the
DAC<00:03:14.720> assistant<00:03:15.129> VI<00:03:16.129> is<00:03:16.250> generated<00:03:17.000> you'll<00:03:17.419> see

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
DAC assistant VI is generated you'll see

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.740 
DAC assistant VI is generated you'll see
it<00:03:17.659> only<00:03:17.720> has<00:03:17.989> one<00:03:18.019> data<00:03:18.919> input<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:20.599> it's

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
it only has one data input and so it's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.199 
it only has one data input and so it's
actually<00:03:20.900> looking<00:03:21.379> for<00:03:21.590> an<00:03:21.799> array<00:03:22.159> of<00:03:22.370> four

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
actually looking for an array of four

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.080 
actually looking for an array of four
values<00:03:23.479> for<00:03:23.870> each<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.019> those<00:03:24.409> relay<00:03:25.069> lines<00:03:25.340> so
