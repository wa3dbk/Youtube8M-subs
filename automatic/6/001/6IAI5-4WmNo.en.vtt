00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.710 

I've<00:00:01.230> started<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.790> doing<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.879> new<00:00:03.030> circuit

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
I've started a doing a new circuit

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
I've started a doing a new circuit
I've<00:00:04.380> got<00:00:04.620> battery<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:06.710> which<00:00:07.710> at<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> moment

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I've got battery a which at the moment

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.959 
I've got battery a which at the moment
has<00:00:08.700> got<00:00:08.970> eleven<00:00:09.450> point<00:00:10.440> seven<00:00:10.800> three<00:00:10.980> volts

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
has got eleven point seven three volts

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.530 
has got eleven point seven three volts
in<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.870> battery<00:00:13.230> C<00:00:13.469> which<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> almost<00:00:14.130> dead

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
in it and battery C which is almost dead

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.590 
in it and battery C which is almost dead
that's<00:00:15.540> got<00:00:16.190> five<00:00:17.190> point<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.670> five<00:00:17.910> volts<00:00:18.480> in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that's got five point one five volts in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.859 
that's got five point one five volts in
it<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.730> way<00:00:20.850> I've<00:00:20.970> hooked<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:22.789> the

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
it and the way I've hooked this up the

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.810 
it and the way I've hooked this up the
secondary<00:00:24.869> coil<00:00:25.430> comes<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> way<00:00:26.730> back

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
secondary coil comes all the way back

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.140 
secondary coil comes all the way back
round<00:00:27.380> into<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> capacitor<00:00:29.119> through<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
round into the capacitor through a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.110 
round into the capacitor through a
bridge<00:00:30.359> rectifier<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.830> straight<00:00:32.460> back<00:00:32.730> into

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
bridge rectifier and straight back into

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
bridge rectifier and straight back into
battery<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.780> again<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.360> then<00:00:37.070> all<00:00:38.070> I've<00:00:38.280> also

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
battery a again and then all I've also

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.500 
battery a again and then all I've also
got<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.930> flyback<00:00:40.260> voltage<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:42.149> reed

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
got is the flyback voltage off the reed

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.049 
got is the flyback voltage off the reed
switch<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:43.680> straight<00:00:43.980> back<00:00:44.160> into<00:00:44.370> battery

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
switch going straight back into battery

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:58.820 
switch going straight back into battery
C<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.600> just<00:00:48.600> start<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:48.989> up<00:00:49.200> now

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.479 

we<00:00:59.340> start<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> have

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.640 

and<00:01:03.940> larger<00:01:04.420> voltage<00:01:04.629> on<00:01:04.989> this<00:01:05.170> which<00:01:05.470> is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
and larger voltage on this which is

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.210 
and larger voltage on this which is
charging<00:01:06.250> battery<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.850> which<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.450> running<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
charging battery a which is running the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
charging battery a which is running the
road<00:01:09.220> set<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:10.830> also<00:01:11.830> we've<00:01:12.310> got<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:14.760> larger

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
road set and also we've got a larger

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.450 
road set and also we've got a larger
voltage<00:01:16.780> battery<00:01:17.740> see

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.760 

so<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.390> think<00:01:26.660> what<00:01:26.960> we're<00:01:27.110> doing<00:01:27.410> here<00:01:27.620> is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
so I think what we're doing here is

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.670 
so I think what we're doing here is
we're<00:01:28.100> charging<00:01:28.370> battery<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.780> charging

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
we're charging battery a and charging

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.610 
we're charging battery a and charging
batteries<00:01:31.070> say<00:01:31.750> while<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:32.930> running<00:01:35.470> if<00:01:36.470> I

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
batteries say while it's running if I

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:55.410 
batteries say while it's running if I
leave<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.040> guy<00:01:37.250> for<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.550> bit

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.290 

so<00:01:56.020> we've<00:01:56.140> got<00:01:56.260> seven<00:01:56.800> point<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.250> get<00:01:58.000> across

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
so we've got seven point to get across

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.000 
so we've got seven point to get across
battery<00:01:59.229> see<00:01:59.470> now<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:01.650> eleven<00:02:02.650> point<00:02:02.920> nine

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
battery see now and eleven point nine

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.680 
battery see now and eleven point nine
nine<00:02:03.510> then<00:02:04.510> across<00:02:04.720> battery<00:02:05.350> i<00:02:06.510> we're<00:02:07.510> still

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
nine then across battery i we're still

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.350 
nine then across battery i we're still
using<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.050> read<00:02:08.200> switch<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:11.470> two<00:02:12.100> men

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
using the read switch and a two men

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.010 
using the read switch and a two men
30:55<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:15.580> produce<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.000> paul<00:02:16.180> says<00:02:18.510> yeah

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
30:55 to produce the paul says yeah

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.770 
30:55 to produce the paul says yeah
even<00:02:20.470> after<00:02:20.709> about<00:02:21.030> two<00:02:22.030> or<00:02:22.060> three<00:02:22.180> hours<00:02:22.360> use

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
even after about two or three hours use

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.430 
even after about two or three hours use
we<00:02:23.290> still<00:02:23.470> got<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> very<00:02:23.830> cool<00:02:24.160> coil<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:26.230> can't

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
we still got a very cool coil you can't

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.650 
we still got a very cool coil you can't
even<00:02:26.590> tell<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:26.950> been<00:02:27.040> switched<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:28.480> a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
even tell it's been switched on it's a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.230 
even tell it's been switched on it's a
very<00:02:29.020> slow<00:02:29.200> loading<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.530> running<00:02:29.800> now

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.300 

you<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> voltage<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.770> up<00:02:37.890> slightly<00:02:38.130> on

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
you see the voltage going up slightly on

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.850 
you see the voltage going up slightly on
that<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.140> battery<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:43.310> 7.24<00:02:45.860> battery

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
that one this is battery I 7.24 battery

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:59.980 
that one this is battery I 7.24 battery
see

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:08.300 

I'm<00:03:00.530> still<00:03:00.920> climbing

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.920 

now<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.360> way<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.660> I've<00:03:09.810> mounted<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.770 

harddrive<00:03:15.930> spindle<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.970> screw<00:03:18.569> with<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
harddrive spindle is a screw with a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840 
harddrive spindle is a screw with a
magnet<00:03:19.170> sellotape<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.400> then<00:03:20.520> he<00:03:20.610> just

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
magnet sellotape to it and then he just

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.820 
magnet sellotape to it and then he just
magnetically<00:03:21.690> connects<00:03:22.020> I<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:28.590> show<00:03:28.739> you

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
magnetically connects I just show you

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.090 
magnetically connects I just show you
that<00:03:28.980> now

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.920 

so<00:03:36.050> basically<00:03:37.050> all<00:03:37.740> this<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> magnet<00:03:38.460> there

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
so basically all this is a magnet there

00:03:38.930 --> 00:04:00.470 
so basically all this is a magnet there
click<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:39.960> magnet<00:03:40.350> damn<00:03:44.090> wait<00:03:45.090> guys

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.440 

we've<00:04:01.230> got<00:04:01.349> twelve<00:04:01.980> point<00:04:02.220> four<00:04:02.459> three<00:04:02.730> across

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
we've got twelve point four three across

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.680 
we've got twelve point four three across
battery<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:03.989> now<00:04:06.830> just<00:04:07.830> start<00:04:08.040> spinning<00:04:08.280> up

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
battery I now just start spinning up

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.259 
battery I now just start spinning up
generating<00:04:09.690> more<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.730> secondary<00:04:11.730> coil

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.469 

which<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.300> going<00:04:15.629> back<00:04:15.810> into<00:04:16.019> battery<00:04:16.470> C<00:04:17.479> so

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
which is going back into battery C so

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.580 
which is going back into battery C so
I'm<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> leave<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.079> running<00:04:19.169> for<00:04:19.350> quite

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
I'm going to leave it running for quite

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.710 
I'm going to leave it running for quite
a<00:04:19.620> while<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.150> hopefully<00:04:21.150> we're<00:04:21.570> going<00:04:21.660> to

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
a while and hopefully we're going to
