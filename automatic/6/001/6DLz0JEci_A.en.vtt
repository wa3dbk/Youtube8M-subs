00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.810
 we go before the event 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.320
 but first thing we're going to do is download material 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.260
 it will be this 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 base a style and a motive 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.830
 let's see if there was new 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.870
 and we are going to press or dear fly 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.420
 this argument 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.270
 we were going 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.460
 to write something 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.460
 now I will put for example the low 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 size 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.970
 I'm telling you 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.100
 slightly larger 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.900
 so that we go well 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 indeed 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010
 this way 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.730
 very well once we have our our written text 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.670
 we are going late, we are going to go to styles if you do not have here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620
 aminta na 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.670
 and here and defend yourself and witnesses 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.360
 let's go to this one 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.920
 scati like haiti 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.140
 let's go to load style 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.630
 we are going to go 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.910
 to the folder 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.700
 where we do not have 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.960
 of chargers and equipment and invented gentleman that load 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.310
 and we have a choice will charge us 2 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 two styles are the same and that from uaga which I said 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.180
 We are gonna give 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.540
 if not 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.100
 creates 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.299
 these relief and this shadow we go again encompassed capable turkeys 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 not only public and especially the text 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.319
 we will go 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.719
 where says 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.769
 if he were here 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.769
 and we are going to give no depth May 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.969
 and a scale 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.289
 a little bigger too for example 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.289
 I was what is the other dot 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.169
 there is also a superposition of motives 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.439
 is in its motives proposal that motivated we are going to try the coffee remove 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.020
 from here 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.279
 and is that as 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.839
 We were going to give to load reason 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.259
 it opens up front half 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.469
 we go where we have downloaded it because here it says thin meters 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
 hidalgo as it is going to recharge it was loaded a texture 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.639
 We are gonna give 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.070
 signed the official 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.629
 Lets put 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.629
 multiply 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.219
 there are three dates 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.479
 as we see now he did not notice it too much 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.399
 let's go every texture 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.739
 We were going to give a little more depth 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.069
 there perfect 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.609
 but we are going to press or what and if we want on how we are going to double 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.689
 crystal because I love let's give then double click 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.249
 we can throw it overlay motifs 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.069
 And power 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.129
 the metal background 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.469
 that we have used before 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.569
 We are gonna give 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.859
 repudiate 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.869
 they started digging produce 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.869
