the<00:02:17.730> biggest<00:02:17.970> thing<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.390> learn<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> lil<00:02:18.870> boy<00:02:19.050> was

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the biggest thing I learn a lil boy was

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.640 
the biggest thing I learn a lil boy was
literally<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.660> freedom<00:02:21.660> question

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
literally that freedom question

literally that freedom question
everything<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:24.090> probably<00:02:24.780> before<00:02:24.870> there

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
everything you do probably before there

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.290 
everything you do probably before there
was<00:02:25.350> too<00:02:25.560> many<00:02:25.680> rules<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.060> about

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
was too many rules you know about

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.260 
was too many rules you know about
cooking<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> most

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
cooking and and I think that's the most

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.870 
cooking and and I think that's the most
important<00:02:30.270> not<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.780> break<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.410> rules<00:02:31.560> and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
important not to break all the rules and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.400 
important not to break all the rules and
at<00:02:32.880> least<00:02:33.060> try<00:02:33.780> everything<00:02:35.840> yeah<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.050> mean<00:02:37.140> even

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
at least try everything yeah I mean even

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.260 
at least try everything yeah I mean even
if<00:02:37.590> something<00:02:37.800> doesn't<00:02:38.040> work<00:02:38.130> yeah<00:02:38.940> it

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
if something doesn't work yeah it

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.910 
if something doesn't work yeah it
doesn't<00:02:39.450> matter<00:02:39.690> yeah<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.620> doesn't<00:02:40.860> matter

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
doesn't matter yeah it doesn't matter

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.190 
doesn't matter yeah it doesn't matter
because<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:42.270> might<00:02:42.450> try<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> hundred<00:02:43.050> things

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
because you might try a hundred things

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 
because you might try a hundred things
as<00:02:43.710> long<00:02:43.890> as<00:02:44.010> one<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.520> works<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.060> its<00:02:45.150> grave

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
as long as one thing works and its grave

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270 
as long as one thing works and its grave
then<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.960> worth<00:02:46.200> trying<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.890> hundred<00:02:47.130> things

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
then it's worth trying a hundred things

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.380 
then it's worth trying a hundred things
and<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.560> say<00:02:49.740> rules<00:02:50.220> are<00:02:50.760> meant<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.330> be

for<00:04:48.490> me<00:04:48.970> that's<00:04:49.210> really<00:04:49.570> excited<00:04:49.960> because

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
for me that's really excited because

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.279 
for me that's really excited because
it's<00:04:50.740> how<00:04:51.310> we<00:04:51.370> work<00:04:51.700> in<00:04:51.820> UK<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.450> guess<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.080> is

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
it's how we work in UK I guess this is

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.050 
it's how we work in UK I guess this is
something<00:04:53.680> very<00:04:53.710> new<00:04:54.070> in<00:04:54.340> Hakone<00:04:54.669> I<00:04:54.970> know

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
something very new in Hakone I know

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.540 
something very new in Hakone I know
about<00:04:55.330> few<00:04:55.720> farms<00:04:56.229> but<00:04:56.440> yeah<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.250> think<00:04:57.310> the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
about few farms but yeah I think the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.430 
about few farms but yeah I think the
most<00:04:57.700> complicated<00:04:58.030> like<00:04:58.390> he<00:04:58.539> says<00:04:58.750> it's<00:04:58.780> not

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
most complicated like he says it's not

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.760 
most complicated like he says it's not
to<00:04:59.530> be<00:04:59.650> able<00:04:59.770> to<00:05:00.039> get<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.870> same<00:05:01.870> product<00:05:02.260> with

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
to be able to get a same product with

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.190 
to be able to get a same product with
the<00:05:02.860> same<00:05:03.039> consistency<00:05:03.610> for<00:05:04.030> for<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> while<00:05:04.990> I

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
the same consistency for for a while I

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.409 
the same consistency for for a while I
mean<00:05:05.710> at<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.919> end<00:05:05.950> when<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.310> have<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.090> work<00:05:07.270> on

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
mean at the end when you have to work on

mean at the end when you have to work on
alucard<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.960> mean<00:05:08.110> either<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.680> something<00:05:09.039> that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
alucard I mean either is something that

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.070 
alucard I mean either is something that
you<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.850> are<00:05:09.940> open<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.330> receive<00:05:10.780> any

vegetables and work with that from a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.810 
vegetables and work with that from a
scratch<00:05:13.570> oh<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.960> mean<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:14.440> guess<00:05:14.590> for<00:05:14.950> meeting

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
scratch oh I mean I guess for meeting

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.610 
scratch oh I mean I guess for meeting
the<00:05:16.030> restaurant<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:16.539> bit<00:05:16.690> more<00:05:16.840> more

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
the restaurant is a bit more more

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.370 
the restaurant is a bit more more
complicated<00:05:18.750> because<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.930> Holy<00:05:20.080> Grail<00:05:20.289> is

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
complicated because the Holy Grail is

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.580 
complicated because the Holy Grail is
consistency<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:21.900> restaurants<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:22.990> have<00:05:23.289> to

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
be consistent otherwise guests don't

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.629 
be consistent otherwise guests don't
come<00:05:25.570> back<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.870> mean<00:05:25.990> putting<00:05:26.470> aside

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
come back I mean putting aside

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.670 
come back I mean putting aside
sustainability<00:05:27.639> putting<00:05:28.090> aside<00:05:28.680> creativity

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
sustainability putting aside creativity

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.950 
sustainability putting aside creativity
put<00:05:29.889> aside<00:05:30.039> all<00:05:30.280> of<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.639> if<00:05:31.180> your<00:05:31.450> restaurant
