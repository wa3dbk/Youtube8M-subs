these are two figures that are easy to

shown embracing like this now if you
follow<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.920> zigzag<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.910> Cupid's<00:02:24.390> body<00:02:24.690> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
follow the zigzag of Cupid's body you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.199 
follow the zigzag of Cupid's body you
ended<00:02:25.530> his<00:02:25.680> foot<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.459> below<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:26.849> in

ended his foot and just below that in

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.430 
ended his foot and just below that in
the<00:02:27.300> very<00:02:27.450> corner<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.020> painting<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.410> a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the very corner of the painting is a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.410 
the very corner of the painting is a
dove<00:02:28.709> which<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.370> another<00:02:29.580> attribute<00:02:30.090> or

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
dove which is another attribute or

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.690 
dove which is another attribute or
symbol<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.110> Venus<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.099> use<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.550> red

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
symbol of Venus now you use the red

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.240 
symbol of Venus now you use the red
zigzag<00:02:33.239> for<00:02:33.690> Cupid's<00:02:34.170> body<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.800> think<00:02:34.860> that's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
zigzag for Cupid's body I think that's

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.680 
zigzag for Cupid's body I think that's
also<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.640> term<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.209> could<00:02:36.420> use<00:02:36.660> for

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
also a term that we could use for

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
also a term that we could use for
Venus's<00:02:37.560> body<00:02:38.099> we<00:02:38.550> go<00:02:38.730> from<00:02:38.970> her<00:02:39.480> right<00:02:39.780> hand

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
Venus's body we go from her right hand

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.470 
Venus's body we go from her right hand
holding<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.950> quiver<00:02:41.280> across<00:02:41.790> her<00:02:42.030> shoulder

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
holding that quiver across her shoulder

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.559 
holding that quiver across her shoulder
down<00:02:42.750> her<00:02:43.050> torso<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.370> across<00:02:44.849> her<00:02:45.300> legs

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
down her torso and then across her legs

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.509 
down her torso and then across her legs
and<00:02:45.930> maybe<00:02:46.470> that's<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.830> metaphor<00:02:47.069> for<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
and maybe that's a metaphor for this

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.670 
and maybe that's a metaphor for this
whole<00:02:47.730> painting<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.300> kind<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.870> zigzagging

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
whole painting this kind of zigzagging

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.309 
whole painting this kind of zigzagging
was<00:02:50.040> back<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.730> forth<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:51.989> does<00:02:52.110> this

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
was back and forth of what does this

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.470 
was back and forth of what does this
mean<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.099> how<00:02:53.280> do<00:02:53.519> these<00:02:53.760> things<00:02:54.090> relate<00:02:54.450> to

top his arm but I'm interested in the

so that we see the back of his hand very

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.580 
so that we see the back of his hand very
much<00:04:40.280> like<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.850> young<00:04:41.060> girl<00:04:41.449> serpent<00:04:42.199> it's

think<00:05:18.919> this<00:05:19.220> perhaps<00:05:19.729> could<00:05:20.150> represent

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
think this perhaps could represent

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.700 
think this perhaps could represent
syphilis<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:22.400> venereal<00:05:23.090> disease<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:23.960> so<00:05:24.440> is

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
syphilis the venereal disease and so is

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.550 
syphilis the venereal disease and so is
this<00:05:25.099> some<00:05:25.370> kind<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.760> moral<00:05:26.389> about<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.139> cloth

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
this some kind of moral about the cloth

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.960 
this some kind of moral about the cloth
of<00:05:28.039> pleasure

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
of pleasure

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.320 
of pleasure
perhaps<00:05:29.479> that<00:05:29.930> time<00:05:30.410> reveals<00:05:31.039> hard<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.180> know

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
perhaps that time reveals hard to know

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.379 
perhaps that time reveals hard to know
so<00:05:33.200> on<00:05:33.470> one<00:05:33.830> side<00:05:33.860> we<00:05:34.130> have<00:05:34.310> folly<00:05:34.729> perhaps<00:05:35.240> on

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
so on one side we have folly perhaps on

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.140 
so on one side we have folly perhaps on
the<00:05:35.510> other<00:05:35.539> insane<00:05:36.380> regret<00:05:37.070> there<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.700> this

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
the other insane regret there is this

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.480 
the other insane regret there is this
series<00:05:39.139> of<00:05:39.260> opposition's<00:05:39.889> this

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
series of opposition's this

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.760 
series of opposition's this
lasciviousness<00:05:41.240> this<00:05:41.960> crossing<00:05:42.620> of

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
lasciviousness this crossing of

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.879 
lasciviousness this crossing of
boundaries<00:05:43.360> deeply<00:05:44.360> uncomfortable<00:05:44.780> we<00:05:45.650> feel

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
boundaries deeply uncomfortable we feel

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.890 
boundaries deeply uncomfortable we feel
uncomfortable<00:05:46.460> it's<00:05:46.580> hard<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:47.000> know<00:05:47.210> what

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
uncomfortable it's hard to know what

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.930 
uncomfortable it's hard to know what
Cosimo<00:05:48.560> de<00:05:48.710> Medici<00:05:48.830> thought<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.580> Medici

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
Cosimo de Medici thought of the Medici

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.450 
Cosimo de Medici thought of the Medici
court<00:05:50.360> or<00:05:50.660> Frances<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.470> first<00:05:51.710> for<00:05:52.190> whom<00:05:52.340> it

court or Frances the first for whom it

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.820 
court or Frances the first for whom it
was<00:05:52.580> likely<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:53.090> gift<00:05:53.450> but<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.260> does<00:05:54.470> seem<00:05:54.680> as

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
was likely a gift but it does seem as

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.469 
was likely a gift but it does seem as
though<00:05:55.010> it's<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:55.340> kind<00:05:55.700> of<00:05:55.820> intellectual

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
though it's a kind of intellectual

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.050 
though it's a kind of intellectual
puzzle<00:05:57.200> something<00:05:58.070> that<00:05:58.190> had<00:05:58.340> multiple

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
puzzle something that had multiple

Suns paintings that have a sense of

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.180 
Suns paintings that have a sense of
balance<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.360> harmony<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:04.200> structure<00:06:04.890> this

balance and harmony and structure this
painting<00:06:05.610> doesn't<00:06:05.820> give<00:06:06.210> us<00:06:06.360> any<00:06:06.600> one<00:06:07.020> thing

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
painting doesn't give us any one thing

painting doesn't give us any one thing
to<00:06:07.530> look<00:06:07.650> at<00:06:07.830> but<00:06:08.310> gives<00:06:08.490> us<00:06:08.610> many<00:06:08.850> things<00:06:09.030> so

conclusion<00:06:14.430> for<00:06:15.120> me<00:06:15.240> this<00:06:15.360> painting<00:06:15.750> is<00:06:15.870> a

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
conclusion for me this painting is a

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.890 
conclusion for me this painting is a
reminder<00:06:16.440> that<00:06:16.890> the<00:06:17.760> conceit<00:06:18.240> that<00:06:18.270> we<00:06:18.660> have

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
reminder that the conceit that we have

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.680 
reminder that the conceit that we have
that<00:06:19.230> technology<00:06:19.620> that<00:06:20.430> our<00:06:20.790> society<00:06:21.540> that

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
that technology that our society that

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.170 
that technology that our society that
our<00:06:21.750> culture<00:06:22.380> gains<00:06:22.950> more<00:06:23.250> and<00:06:23.310> more<00:06:23.550> that<00:06:24.060> we

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
our culture gains more and more that we

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.270 
our culture gains more and more that we
learn<00:06:24.210> more<00:06:24.720> and<00:06:24.780> more<00:06:25.110> it's<00:06:25.500> a<00:06:25.590> reminder<00:06:25.890> that

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
learn more and more it's a reminder that

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.490 
learn more and more it's a reminder that
we've<00:06:26.700> also<00:06:26.940> lost<00:06:27.420> that<00:06:27.900> we've<00:06:28.080> forgotten

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
we've also lost that we've forgotten

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.680 
we've also lost that we've forgotten
that<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:29.160> past<00:06:29.400> and<00:06:29.670> its<00:06:29.790> meanings<00:06:30.240> have

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
that the past and its meanings have

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.230 
that the past and its meanings have
slipped<00:06:31.110> out<00:06:31.350> of<00:06:31.410> our<00:06:31.800> grasp<00:06:32.070> it's<00:06:32.730> quite

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
slipped out of our grasp it's quite

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.330 
slipped out of our grasp it's quite
likely<00:06:33.570> that<00:06:33.780> we'll<00:06:34.050> never<00:06:34.320> recover<00:06:34.890> what

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
likely that we'll never recover what

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.480 
likely that we'll never recover what
this<00:06:35.490> painting<00:06:35.730> really<00:06:36.030> means
