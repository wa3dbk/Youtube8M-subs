so<00:00:11.300> we're<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.809> modify<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.769> little<00:00:14.130> bit

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610

to<00:00:15.500> what<00:00:16.500> would<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.490> think<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.850> sound

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
to what would what I think would sound

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.710 
to what would what I think would sound
best<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> band<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.189> well<00:00:20.939> basically<00:00:21.119> have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
just a few chords it's a fairly simple

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.060 
just a few chords it's a fairly simple
song<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:27.060> far<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> chords<00:00:27.900> go<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.830> first

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
then we're gonna resolve it by releasing

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.380 
then we're gonna resolve it by releasing
the<00:01:12.620> 6<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.160> just<00:01:13.400> evening<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.150> ones

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
distinct piano part it's pretty much one

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.800

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
song and it's these G sharps up here so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.250 
song and it's these G sharps up here so
you're<00:02:04.850> gonna<00:02:05.030> play<00:02:05.300> those<00:02:05.480> gee<00:02:05.720> shucks<00:02:06.020> for

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
you're gonna play those gee shucks for

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.960 
you're gonna play those gee shucks for
measure<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> half<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.340> if<00:02:07.400> we<00:02:07.520> counted<00:02:07.880> them

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
measure and a half so if we counted them

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.430 
measure and a half so if we counted them
it<00:02:08.149> would<00:02:08.240> be<00:02:08.420> one<00:02:09.170> two<00:02:09.740> three<00:02:10.120> four<00:02:11.120> one<00:02:11.840> two

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
it would be one two three four one two

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.470 
it would be one two three four one two
and<00:02:12.950> then<00:02:13.430> I'm<00:02:13.610> three<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:13.940> four<00:02:14.180> we're<00:02:14.360> gonna

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and then I'm three and four we're gonna

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.620 
and then I'm three and four we're gonna
resolve<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.050> F<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.360> kind<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
resolve to the F and just to kind of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.390 
resolve to the F and just to kind of
reinforce<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.470> sound<00:02:24.890> we're<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:25.280> gonna

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
reinforce that sound we're just gonna

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.880 
reinforce that sound we're just gonna
add<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.670> G<00:02:26.060> sharps<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.570> bass<00:02:26.780> again<00:02:27.170> so

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
add the G sharps in the bass again so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.830 
add the G sharps in the bass again so
we're<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.220> gonna<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.580> playing<00:02:28.880> basically

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
we're just gonna be playing basically

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:45.830 
we're just gonna be playing basically
two<00:02:30.530> different<00:02:30.560> kinds<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.100> octaves<00:02:31.490> here

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.110 

Oh

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.899 

let<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.239> ring<00:02:50.390> out<00:02:50.890> cut<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:52.760> come

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
let it ring out cut it and then come

00:02:52.909 --> 00:03:00.760 
let it ring out cut it and then come
back<00:02:52.939> in<00:02:56.319> okay<00:02:57.319> that's<00:02:57.650> pretty<00:02:58.459> much<00:02:58.579> it
