reverse and roll left and roll right now

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.439 
reverse and roll left and roll right now
with<00:00:49.620> mode<00:00:49.890> 1<00:00:50.249> however<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.909> controls<00:00:51.269> are

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
with mode 1 however the controls are

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.819 
with mode 1 however the controls are
reversed<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.649> taking

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
reversed so it's kind of like taking

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
reversed so it's kind of like taking
your<00:00:53.070> steering<00:00:53.399> wheel<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.879> your<00:00:54.179> gas<00:00:54.390> pedal

your steering wheel and your gas pedal

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720 
your steering wheel and your gas pedal
and<00:00:55.050> switching<00:00:55.829> them<00:00:55.890> around<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.429> it's<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and switching them around so it's a

and switching them around so it's a

precise aircraft it's really fast

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.170 
precise aircraft it's really fast
it's<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.770> good<00:01:40.920> forward<00:01:41.310> reverse<00:01:41.490> motion<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it's got good forward reverse motion and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it's got a really precise spin but like

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's got a really precise spin but like
I<00:01:44.670> said<00:01:44.880> I've<00:01:45.060> never<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.750> flown<00:01:46.050> mode<00:01:46.350> one

you<00:01:46.800> pretty<00:01:47.100> much<00:01:47.250> decide<00:01:47.670> either<00:01:47.910> mode<00:01:48.210> 1<00:01:48.450> or

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you pretty much decide either mode 1 or

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200 
you pretty much decide either mode 1 or
boat<00:01:48.750> 2<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.290> stick<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.980> so<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:50.850> kind<00:01:51.120> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
boat 2 and stick with it so it's kind of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
boat 2 and stick with it so it's kind of
it<00:01:51.480> kind<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.690> hurts<00:01:51.870> my<00:01:52.080> brain<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.620> bit

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it kind of hurts my brain a little bit

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
it kind of hurts my brain a little bit
to<00:01:52.830> fly<00:01:53.010> this<00:01:53.070> around<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.640> I'll<00:01:53.760> try<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.060> do

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to fly this around but I'll try and do

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780 
to fly this around but I'll try and do
my<00:01:54.360> best<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.470> precise<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.610> can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
my best to make it as precise as I can

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.070 
my best to make it as precise as I can
even<00:01:57.000> show<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> performance<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
even show you the performance that it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.810 
even show you the performance that it
can<00:01:58.170> actually<00:01:58.320> give<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.040> flight<00:01:59.400> time<00:01:59.640> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
can actually give now the flight time is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
can actually give now the flight time is
going<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.120> about<00:02:00.330> five<00:02:00.720> minutes<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.410> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
going to be about five minutes and the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.500 
going to be about five minutes and the
charge<00:02:01.860> time<00:02:02.220> from<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> transmitter<00:02:03.240> is

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
charge time from the transmitter is

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.170 
charge time from the transmitter is
about<00:02:04.050> 50<00:02:04.560> minutes<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.760> use<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
about 50 minutes but if you use the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180 
about 50 minutes but if you use the
included<00:02:06.570> USB<00:02:06.870> charger<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> charge<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
included USB charger the charge time is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.589 
included USB charger the charge time is
really<00:02:08.340> only<00:02:08.580> about<00:02:08.670> 20<00:02:09.149> minutes<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
really only about 20 minutes so I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.080 
really only about 20 minutes so I
suggest<00:02:09.959> always<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.679> USB<00:02:11.099> charger<00:02:11.489> don't

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
suggest always use the USB charger don't

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.489 
suggest always use the USB charger don't
charge<00:02:12.330> off<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> transmitter<00:02:13.049> in<00:02:13.170> waste<00:02:13.349> your

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
charge off the transmitter in waste your

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.860 
charge off the transmitter in waste your
batteries<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> let's<00:02:15.209> go<00:02:15.329> ahead<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.659> give<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
batteries so let's go ahead and give you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.760 
batteries so let's go ahead and give you
a<00:02:15.900> little<00:02:16.140> flight<00:02:16.349> demonstration<00:02:17.069> here

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
a little flight demonstration here

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.350 
a little flight demonstration here
the<00:02:18.070> best<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.700> give<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.300> I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the best one that I can give you like I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.690 
the best one that I can give you like I
said<00:02:19.720> I've<00:02:19.990> only<00:02:20.200> had<00:02:20.470> about<00:02:20.710> five<00:02:21.400> or<00:02:21.580> six

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
said I've only had about five or six

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.570 
said I've only had about five or six
flights<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.330> mode<00:02:22.570> one<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:24.010> may<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
flights on mode one so it may be a

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.160 
flights on mode one so it may be a
little<00:02:24.910> twitchy<00:02:25.330> compared<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.050> my<00:02:26.140> normal

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
little twitchy compared to my normal

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.559 
little twitchy compared to my normal
five

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.869 

it<00:02:34.080> does<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> trend<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.280> stem<00:02:35.580> which

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
it does have a trend for the stem which

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.319 
it does have a trend for the stem which
is<00:02:35.909> pretty<00:02:36.209> precise<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.269> see<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:41.329> gyro

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
is pretty precise you can see the gyro

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.089 
is pretty precise you can see the gyro
that<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.629> has<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.049> dust-heap<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.709> has<00:02:43.890> some

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
that it has on a dust-heap it has some

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:53.040 
that it has on a dust-heap it has some
pretty<00:02:44.459> badly

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.160 

it<00:02:54.050> actually<00:02:54.470> does<00:02:54.650> roll<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.930> roll

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
it actually does roll that and roll

00:02:57.170 --> 00:07:30.550 
it actually does roll that and roll
right<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.770> good

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.990 

so<00:07:31.560> as<00:07:31.680> you<00:07:31.800> can<00:07:31.920> see<00:07:32.100> it<00:07:32.190> for<00:07:32.340> a<00:07:32.370> four-channel

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
so as you can see it for a four-channel

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.440 
so as you can see it for a four-channel
it<00:07:33.120> is<00:07:33.300> pretty<00:07:33.540> precise<00:07:33.900> unfortunately<00:07:34.890> my

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.450 
it is pretty precise unfortunately my

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.090 
it is pretty precise unfortunately my
mode<00:07:36.450> one<00:07:36.660> skills<00:07:37.020> are<00:07:37.230> not<00:07:37.530> as<00:07:37.590> good<00:07:37.830> as<00:07:37.950> my

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100 
mode one skills are not as good as my

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.910 
mode one skills are not as good as my
mode<00:07:38.280> two<00:07:38.550> skills<00:07:38.910> so<00:07:39.330> it's<00:07:40.290> a<00:07:40.350> little<00:07:40.590> shaky

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:40.920 
mode two skills so it's a little shaky

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.920 
mode two skills so it's a little shaky
in<00:07:41.190> the<00:07:41.340> air<00:07:41.460> but<00:07:41.820> I<00:07:42.060> am<00:07:42.420> getting<00:07:42.600> the<00:07:42.720> hang<00:07:42.810> of

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
in the air but I am getting the hang of

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.990 
in the air but I am getting the hang of
it<00:07:43.020> okay<00:07:43.380> it<00:07:44.010> is<00:07:44.160> a<00:07:44.190> gyro-stabilized

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
it okay it is a gyro-stabilized

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.090 
it okay it is a gyro-stabilized
helicopter<00:07:45.600> it<00:07:45.750> really<00:07:45.990> is<00:07:46.200> fully<00:07:46.590> functional

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.100

helicopter it really is fully functional
port<00:07:48.000> channel<00:07:48.240> it's<00:07:48.870> a<00:07:48.930> lot<00:07:49.050> of<00:07:49.170> fun<00:07:49.320> to<00:07:49.410> fly

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
port channel it's a lot of fun to fly

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.000 
port channel it's a lot of fun to fly
it's<00:07:49.920> really<00:07:50.340> stable<00:07:50.550> it's<00:07:50.880> easy<00:07:51.090> to<00:07:51.300> fly<00:07:52.010> the

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010 
it's really stable it's easy to fly the
