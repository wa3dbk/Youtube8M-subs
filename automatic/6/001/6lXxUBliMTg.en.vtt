00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
will always get in the way

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.489 
will always get in the way
and<00:06:35.789> then<00:06:36.789> you<00:06:36.999> can<00:06:37.179> just<00:06:37.479> flip<00:06:37.929> his<00:06:38.199> arm

and then you can just flip his arm
around<00:06:39.479> will<00:06:40.479> decide<00:06:40.929> to<00:06:41.169> decide<00:06:41.559> and<00:06:43.289> then

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 
around will decide to decide and then

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.350 
around will decide to decide and then
there<00:06:44.589> you<00:06:44.709> have<00:06:44.949> it<00:06:45.119> or<00:06:46.119> if<00:06:47.080> you<00:06:47.619> want<00:06:47.649> them<00:06:48.360> to

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
there you have it or if you want them to

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.480 
there you have it or if you want them to

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.559 
be posed like this you can move his arm
like<00:06:52.119> so<00:06:52.740> without<00:06:53.740> putting<00:06:54.099> stress<00:06:54.849> on<00:06:54.909> his

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
like so without putting stress on his

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:03.869 
like so without putting stress on his
side<00:06:55.869> the<00:06:59.369> side<00:07:00.369> is<00:07:00.909> not<00:07:01.719> a<00:07:02.429> traditional<00:07:03.429> ninja

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 
side the side is not a traditional ninja

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:09.589 
side the side is not a traditional ninja
weapon<00:07:04.449> it<00:07:05.110> is<00:07:05.139> from<00:07:06.180> Okinawan<00:07:07.180> karate<00:07:07.419> and

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
weapon it is from Okinawan karate and

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.350 
weapon it is from Okinawan karate and
the<00:07:10.599> nunchucks<00:07:11.169> for<00:07:11.469> Michelangelo<00:07:12.149> that's<00:07:13.149> a

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
the nunchucks for Michelangelo that's a

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.230 
the nunchucks for Michelangelo that's a
Chinese<00:07:13.599> weapon<00:07:14.259> so<00:07:14.559> the<00:07:15.279> only<00:07:15.490> thing<00:07:15.759> that<00:07:16.089> is

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
Chinese weapon so the only thing that is

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.170 
Chinese weapon so the only thing that is
pretty<00:07:16.869> much<00:07:17.080> close<00:07:17.409> to<00:07:17.439> ninjutsu<00:07:18.249> is<00:07:18.580> the<00:07:18.969> bow

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
pretty much close to ninjutsu is the bow

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.899 
pretty much close to ninjutsu is the bow
in<00:07:19.389> the<00:07:19.539> katana<00:07:20.849> but<00:07:22.349> during<00:07:23.349> you<00:07:24.309> know<00:07:24.339> that

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:24.909 
in the katana but during you know that

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.719 
in the katana but during you know that
time<00:07:25.240> period<00:07:25.719> other<00:07:26.169> weapons<00:07:26.860> were<00:07:27.129> being

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:27.729 
time period other weapons were being

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.730 
time period other weapons were being
aims<00:07:28.089> like<00:07:28.330> the<00:07:28.449> Casati<00:07:28.869> fundo<00:07:29.319> and<00:07:29.559> stuff

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
aims like the Casati fundo and stuff

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.679 
aims like the Casati fundo and stuff
like<00:07:29.889> that<00:07:30.129> in<00:07:30.339> and<00:07:32.999> during<00:07:33.999> modern<00:07:34.449> times

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:34.689 
like that in and during modern times

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:39.299 
like that in and during modern times
like<00:07:35.080> when<00:07:36.179> I'll<00:07:37.179> say<00:07:37.629> when<00:07:38.189> ninja<00:07:39.189> was

00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:39.309 
like when I'll say when ninja was

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:41.339 
like when I'll say when ninja was
starting<00:07:39.639> to<00:07:39.669> become<00:07:40.089> his<00:07:40.269> extinct<00:07:41.050> new

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:41.349 
starting to become his extinct new

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:43.079 
starting to become his extinct new
weapons<00:07:41.860> were<00:07:42.009> added<00:07:42.519> or<00:07:42.639> something<00:07:42.969> like

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:43.089 
weapons were added or something like

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:45.059 
weapons were added or something like
that<00:07:43.149> so<00:07:43.509> I<00:07:43.719> guess<00:07:44.289> that's<00:07:44.469> the<00:07:44.619> reason<00:07:44.949> why

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:45.069 
that so I guess that's the reason why

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:53.429 
that so I guess that's the reason why
they<00:07:45.279> have<00:07:45.939> given<00:07:46.529> this<00:07:47.529> ideal<00:07:51.509> go<00:07:52.509> ahead<00:07:52.719> but

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:53.439 
they have given this ideal go ahead but

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:59.600 
they have given this ideal go ahead but
uh<00:07:53.469> yeah<00:07:54.369> that<00:07:55.269> is<00:07:56.249> Raphael<00:07:57.249> in<00:07:57.490> a<00:07:57.610> nutshell

00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.610
