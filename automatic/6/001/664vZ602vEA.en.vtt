00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello many of you told me not to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.839
 they get seasonal they do not know 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
 where to buy it in some countries not 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.950
 they sold it so they would order them 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 put you asked me this video and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.920
 here they are finally and ingredients 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.590
 what we need is a cup of milk 5 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 spoonfuls and big dates of milk in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.960
 and tiny powder and a teaspoon 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.960
 Butter 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.590
 The first thing you have to do is put 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.700
 liquid milk and milk powder a 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.190
 fire between medium and low but medium but 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.230
 not so short half of those two 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.360
 ranges 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.280
 [Music] 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.520
 said a wooden spoon we are going to 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.940
 stir to help the milk 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.610
 powder is completely dissolved and 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.830
 let's leave it there between medium fire and 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.720
 under about a minute and 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.970
 when the minute passes we will add in 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.500
 the teaspoon of butter and we continue 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.629
 stirring with wooden spoon this 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.520
 milk is super super easy to do what 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.740
 only is to leave it on fire 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.710
 approximately for 5 minutes then 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.110
 we leave there for a minute and then 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.320
 We stir that the other reason and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.390
 we stir another one and we turn it like that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 successively until completing the 5 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.020
 minutes and when the 5 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.620
 minutes let's take it to the blender 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.620
 for a minute 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.200
 and well something very important is that as 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.150
 We take the milk for 5 minutes to the fire 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 as that decreases the amount does not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.370
 so if you need a cup the best 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.320
 make 2 and need them to make 3 or 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.960
 whether they add a cup to make a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.870
 extra rate because as it decreases it is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.610
 better than over them and not lacking and 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.200
 well past the minute only remains 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 serve it can keep it in the fridge 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.760
 and I wanted to know if it worked so 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.730
 I made the jelly mosaic and it came out 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.650
 perfect then I recommend it super 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.450
 and well that was it for today's video 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.310
 I hope you liked it especially 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.980
 that has been very useful for me because I 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.510

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.000
